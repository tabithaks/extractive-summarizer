44,1989,MDV,"ï»¿It is indeed a pleasure for me and the members of my delegation to extend to Ambassador Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities and experience. I am fully confident that under his able and wise leadership the Assembly will further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.
My delegation associates itself with previous speakers in expressing its appreciation of the dedicated efforts of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
As in previous years, my delegation wishes to note its satisfaction with and gratitude for the assiduous and unrelenting efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the cause of peace and international harmony. We pay a tribute to him for his untiring efforts to promote conditions conducive to the realization of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, we praise and congratulate him on the successes the Organization has achieved in recent years. More particularly we praise him for the renewed faith and regeneration of confidence in the Organization and its ability to Play an instrumental role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  
Today we find ourselves at an important crossroads. Recent years have witnessed a welcome positive change in the international political climate. The confrontational tone evident in super-Power relations not too long ago continues to show signs of thawing. At the same time,, a number of regional and sub regional conflicts have taken momentous strides towards resolution. Many more protracted conflicts show signs of hope and movement. Though one might argue that the present situation continues to be delicate, the process made can hardly escape notice and is indeed worthy of recognition. 
Developments in southern Africa, and more particularly in Namibia with regard to the implementation of the United Nations independence plan, are welcome signals of hope, but amidst the hopes there are still dark reminders of the precariousness of global political reconciliation. A number of problems remain unsolved and several of these, such as the conflicts in the Middle East, continue to simmer.
We are therefore at an important crossroads. We feel that there is enough good will to set in motion the process of evolution towards peace and stability. We see signs that the human intellect is resourceful enough to devise ideas that are conducive to our survival. Fresh concepts of peace and security have gained currency, but at the same time we continue to live under the dark shadow of nuclear devices. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, both horizontally and vertically, is a tragic reminder of the difficulties and obstacles which stand between mankind and lasting peace.
On the economic front hard choices need to be made. The 1980s have witnessed one of the longest spells of growth for the industrialized countries, while the situation in the South, particularly in the least developed countries, continues to deteriorate. Benefits of trade continue to be disproportionate. Commodity prices have not regained their value in real terms. Aid flows continue to be inadequate. The debt burden borne by many third world countries is stifling economic growth and efforts for development, causing political instability. The link between economic development and the environment has recently been recognized and it is encouraging to note the high profile given to environmental issues at the Paris summit meeting of the Group of Seven in July this year, in this regard, it is of particular interest that there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the fact that certain technologies have a deleterious effect on the environment. The question is how these technologies can be replaced through a global programme of co-operation.
No single fact, no single object, defines our moment in civilization more than does the existence of large nuclear arsenals. we have the horrible capacity to destroy our planet several times other, either by accident or by design. Nuclear weapons instil fear and beget mistrust and insecurity. They have a remarkable tendency to set hostile relations in concrete. They aggravate the security dilemma of states and perpetuate a confliction mode of behaviour. This, therefore, fuels the arms race and defence budgets soar while expenditures that are benevolent tend to plummet. 
The UN Conference on the relationship between disarmament and development served as a timely reminder of the opportunity costs of armaments, both nuclear and conventional. However the opportunity cost of nuclear weaponry is not only development. The international political climate and the security perceptions of states, as well as the environment, are actual and potential sacrifices to
nuclear weapons. Furthermore. the potential horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons issues the stark and grim warning that regional rivalries would be on an ever shorter fuse and that cataclysm would be that much closer.
It is in view of these strong objections  to nuclear weapons and their Proliferation and deployment that my delegation has consistently and strongly supported United Nations calls for disarmament.
The confidence that can he derived from genuine arms reduction has a pervasive effect on the security environment. The transition that many of the world's conflict, are making towards negotiations and understanding owes a great deal to improved relations between the super-Powers, which were themselves in part inspired by the historic arms reduction agreement of December 1987 for this reason -at Maldives has always supported all efforts with a view to general and complete disarmament, including the total elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and reduction in conventional armaments. We also believe that nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace could inspire trust, good Will and operation among states, transforming into secure communities contributing to global peace and security. We therefore support calls for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. 
I express my delegation's fullest support for the people of Namibia, with our Namibia achieved their independence.  Apartheid is an affront to mankind and a crime against humanity. No amount of tinkering with it can placate the sense of outrage and indignation felt by the world community for this immoral practice. No amount of cosmetic change can restore Justice and dignity to the oppressed majority in South Africa. Maldives express our solidarity with the oppressed majority in South Africa in their struggle against apartheid. We condemn unequivocally the system of apartheid and condemn Pretoria regime for its continued defiance of the UN resolutions.  
By far the greatest conflict in our time has been and continues to be the conflict in the Middle East. At the heart of this conflict is the question of Palestine. However, it is only in recent years that the Palestinian issue has evoked even a reasoned amount of concern in some key States. The search for peace continues to be frustrated by the hard-line and obstinate policies of Israel. Meanwhile, the situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate. The 22 month long intifadah emphasizes the intensity of the situation posed by Zionist occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories, including Jerusalem.
The Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the blatant abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We also deplore the continued defiance by Israel of United Nations resolutions and its violation of international law and all norms of civilized behaviour. We reiterate our full support and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for self-determination and independence. We therefore welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising, which is being viewed as the just and valiant struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable rights. We extend our whole-hearted support to the proposal for an early convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the full and independent participation of Palestine.
The situation in Lebanon remains volatile. The civil war, now in its fifteenth year, continues to take an increasing toll of human life. We fervently hope that, with the developments taking place in the region and elsewhere, the question of Lebanon will be solved in a manner which will restore its independence and national integrity, and alleviate the sufferings of its people. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the members of the Arab league, both past and present, to resolve the situation in Lebanon and we request the international community to give their support to the people of Lebanon in their efforts to solve their problems.
On a more hopeful note, we are pleased that, contrary to some early pessimistic assessments, the cease-fire agreed on between Iran and Iraq in the Gulf has held firm, indicating the sincerity of the parties to the conflict. We welcome the commitments undertaken by them to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. In particular, we applaud the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General for the resolution of this conflict and urge both parties to maintain the momentum of peace created and envisaged by the cease-fire. 
While we welcome the positive developments in Afghanistan - I refer to the withdraw of foreign troops - we regret that the situation has not been completely settled. We reiterate our call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the provisions of the Geneva Agreements in order not to frustrate the prevailing opportunities for a just and lasting solution to the problem. We urge the international community to provide humanitarian and economic assistance for the relief and rehabilitation of refugees, as well as for the long-term reconstruction of that ravaged country.  
Positive strides have been taken towards the solution of the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the withdraw of the Vietnamese troops and we appreciate the diplomatic efforts to obtain a comprehensive and lasting solution to the dispute including the Jakarta informal meeting as well as the international conference in Paris. However, realizing the delicacy of the current situation, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint. 
The process of reunification of peoples should be through peaceful means and by the creation of conditions conducive to reconciliation, peace and stability among those sharing the same aspirations. We remain optimistic about the prospects for peaceful national reconciliation in the Korean peninsula. The good office of the UN could be utilized in these peace negotiations.  
Another issue that needs our attention is the situation in Cyprus. That prolonged inter-communal dispute should be solved urgently, with due regard to the national integrity of the nation and the aspirations of its peoples. We welcome the recent high-level contacts between the two communities and hope that the revived inter-communal dialogue will lead to inter-communal reconciliation on the basis of equality and integrity for both communities. We commend the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in searching for a settlement to the conflict.
As I have already noted, the world economic situation continues to be bleak for the developing countries. Their situation has been worsened by the limited of aid since the early 1980s, rampant domestic inflation, crippling debts and the exorbitant burden of debt-servicing. The situation is aggravated by their falling share in international trade, by persistent negative trends in the terms of trade, owing to protectionism, and by the upsurge in unilateralism and other practices that jeopardize the multilateral nature of trade. It is regrettable that, on the whole, despite recent measures whereby the resources of the international finance institutions have been increased by the plans of some of the most developed countries to recycle part of their surplus into the developing countries, the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance has not been met. Moreover, as regards the least developed countries, which continue to register negative growth rates, the official development assistance target of 0.15 per cent of GNP has not been met either.
Economic insecurity is not the only visible threat facing many of us in the world today. Indeed, we consider the environment to be one of the most important aspects of the quality of life that we have to address now in our quest for economic and industrial development. We welcome the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development and regard the event as a valuable opportunity which should be fully utilized to promote a comprehensive approach to the environmental problems related to the development activities of mankind.
While serious efforts are being made at global, regional and national levels to protect the environment, my delegation is particularly concerned about the effects of the degradation of the environment, especially the depletion of the ozone layer and the consequent global warming and rise in sea level. Maldives is a low-lying archipelagic State, entirely dependent upon its surrounding seas. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem, or any rise in the mean sea level, is a matter of grave concern to the Maldives, it will be recalled that two years ago we witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions, which caused extensive damage, with the assistance of friendly countries, we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated islands from possible natural calamities. Tidal waves, hurricanes and typhoons are increasingly frequent phenomena, and today there is a greater awareness that man's tampering with the environment and certain technologies inimical to the environment do have a direct bearing on the behaviour of the global weather system.
Maldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Our interest in the issue continues undiminished, and we welcome the universal interest that has been expressed in the preservation of the environment. I should like also to mention that in November this year the Maldives will host a conference of small States on sea-level rise. We are confident that the conference will contribute to the global efforts in addressing this important issue.
It is an old and true maxim that the best indicator of the strength and stability of an international security system or political order is the survival of its weakest members. That being the case, and in view of the implications, the ever-increasing dangers of terrorism and mercenarism to the sovereignty of small and weak States are appalling.
Terrorism is not simply a minor irritant to anybody - least of all, to the small nations whose sovereignty is not only held hostage but can be easily usurped. The very existence of this possibility in the first place does not augur well for the security of the international community. The cherished principles that have so long contributed to the survival of the present State system and that are indispensable values of our global civilization are at stake. Today it may be we, the small States, whose sovereignty can be robbed by a handful of mercenaries or a gang of bounty hunters. Tomorrow it could be the larger countries, which, even at present, face some erosion of their sovereignty and security by similar acts. The difference is that when a small State is subjected to a terrorist onslaught or an invasion by mercenaries the consequences can be irreversible, both in political and in economic terms. We in the Maldives were close to becoming the victim of such a dastardly attempt last November.
It is evident that peoples engaging in acts of terrorism and mercenarism, which endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, need to be deterred. The security of small States is too weak to be taken care of by mere self-help. The implications that efforts to strengthen their own security have for the prospects of economic development through the severe, if at all affordable, opportunity costs and the impact on social and political values, as well as the long-term implications for the sustenance of democracy in a militarised society, are negative. By requesting the inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly of an item related to the protection and security of small States, we sought to highlight the issue that I have just mentioned. We brought the issue to this forum not because we are unwilling to defend our values, nor have we taken it up here because our peoples lack valour. 
Small States do have as friends States that can assist, and have assisted, in strengthening their security. While we are grateful for the sense of duty that these friends have shown, it is with regret that we note that bilateral security arrangements in the international system have not yet evolved to a level of maturity whereby the interests of the weaker partner can be safeguarded. Nor are the socio-political identity of the weaker State and the principle of sovereign equality strong enough to be impervious to the possible vicissitudes of unequal relationships. Moreover, our political systems continue to be afflicted by misconceptions which can distort actions taken with the best of intentions. Consequently, the greater the power differential, the greater the propensity to misconceptions and the more hapless the predicament of the weaker parties. It is for this reason that we believe that multilateral frameworks are the most feasible nodes of a sound security mechanism for the weakest Members of the Organization, even if the actual support or assistance in a given situation is rendered at a regional or bilateral level.
As I noted earlier, it is my humble opinion that we are at a pivotal point, an important crossroads in our global political development. It is our belief that we are at a particularly auspicious moment in history to forge ahead in strengthening the norms of our global political and security systems. Thus it is our sincere hope that the Organization will take a similar momentous step, a leap forward in ushering in a new era of security for the small States. We trust that this critical step will be taken to safeguard the principles which are espoused by the Organization and on which the survival of a large number of this community depends.
","As in previous years, my delegation wishes to note its satisfaction with and gratitude for the assiduous and unrelenting efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the cause of peace and international harmony. Developments in southern Africa, and more particularly in Namibia with regard to the implementation of the United Nations independence plan, are welcome signals of hope, but amidst the hopes there are still dark reminders of the precariousness of global political reconciliation. The link between economic development and the environment has recently been recognized and it is encouraging to note the high profile given to environmental issues at the Paris summit meeting of the Group of Seven in July this year, in this regard, it is of particular interest that there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the fact that certain technologies have a deleterious effect on the environment.

44,1989,FIN,"ï»¿
May I begin by congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your wide experience in the United Nations makes you especially qualified to guide the Assembly and its deliberations. You have my best wishes for the demanding task that lies ahead of you. May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General. We owe a great deal to his authority and leadership.
As we are assembled here for the annual general debate, every Member state needs to reflect on certain fundamental questions. Is the United Nations doing everything possible in order to meet its challenges? Are we making progress? Can we say that the United Nations enters the last decade of this century with determination and justified self-confidence? Is my own country doing everything it can in order to help the world Organization? The answers to these questions must be sought in the actual work of the Organization and of its Member States. For my part, I shall try to emphasize some of the challenges we in Finland regard as particularly imports at the present time. It seems to us that the main challenges can be expressed in two words -insecurity and poverty. Both produce fear  d suffering. Neither can be dealt with by any single remedy.
The United Nations was created first and foremost in order to maintain international peace and security. In this respect, the past year represents a mixture of success and disappointment. We are encouraged by the high-level dialogues that have continued between the major Powers. we have witnessed with satisfaction such concrete achievements as the continuing progress in the verified dismantling and destruction of American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. As one of the participating States in the process of the Conference on Security and cooperation in Europe, Finland follow, closely and with ,much hope the new efforts to achieve substantive conventional disarmament in Europe.
At the same time we are concerned about the violence that has erupted and continues in many parts of the world. Most of the underlying problem are already on the agenda of the General Assembly, and we shall express our views on them in due course. Now I want to speak about the global challenges. As regards the process of disarmament on the global level our hopes in Finland are fastened particularly on the preparation of a chemical weapons convention. The political will is there, as was demonstrated again at the conferences held in Paris and in Canberra this year. During this year, as before, Finnish experts have continued their research in order to help to develop appropriate methods that could meet the complex verification requirements  global and comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We expect progress from the protracted negotiations with growing impatience. We welcome the impetus recently given them in the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Security on the global level must take into account other factors in addition to armaments and military threats. Security requires confidence in the future. Such confidence must be felt both by Governments and by their peoples. Only a representative Government that respects human rights and that therefore enjoys the confidence of its own people can face the future with a sense of security and successfully maintain stable relations with other Governments. Some dramatic - in fact, tragic - events have recently illustrated the importance of respect for human rights. We hope that lessons have been learned.
Confidence in the future also requires that the other global challenge, that of poverty, be overcome. The sufferings of poverty may not be in evidence everywhere, but the challenge requires global co-operation for development. The Assembly will meet next year in a special session devoted to international economic co-operation. Soon thereafter a new international development strategy for the 1990s should be adopted. A successful special session and a new and realistic strategy should help to bring about a new spirit of international economic co-operation.
In the process of preparing both the development strategy and the special session emphasis should be on the development of human resources in all forms, including the recognition of a well-functioning private sector in balance with an effective public sector. In that context funding generated by national and international sources should be well co-ordinated. The necessary investments in developing countries require increasing domestic and external financing.
The debt overhang has resulted in the transfer of resources from developing countries, which exceeded $US 50 billion last year, a trend that should be reversed. This requires that a political solution, including a functioning debt strategy, be found. The debt overhang cannot be overcome by the international community at the upcoming special session of the General Assembly and in the new international development strategy. It would be important for the efforts to reverse the transfer of resources from the developing countries if the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as development-and transfer were generally reached. For its part, Finland will this year reach that target set by the General Assembly.
The structure of the United Nations in the economic and social fields should respond to the tasks to be specified in the strategy for the 1990s, thus -consolidating the role of the world Organization. The Finnish Government finds that the Secretary-General has a major catalytic role to play in putting forward concrete proposals to improve the Organization's effectiveness in those fields. That would also help Governments in agreeing on the areas where they are to concentrate the activities of the United Nations in the economic and social fields. Today I wish to emphasize two issues that must, in my opinion, have a Prominent place in this respect. Development cannot be sustainable if the world population continues to grow at its present rate. Development cannot be sustainable if the natural resources of the Earth continue to be depleted at the present rate. There is a growing awareness of such problems in all parts of the world. That awareness is more and more strongly reflected in the work of the United Nations, it has prompted a number of positive measures. More is needed.
According to recent United Nations estimates the world population could stabilize in the twenty-first century at the level of 10 to 11 billion persons. An early stabilisation of population growth would, of course, facilitate the fight against poverty. To reach that goal, determined population policies, translated into national population plans as spelled out in the World Population Plan of Action, should be pursued vigorously.
With regard to the protection of the environment, no problem has lately become
so apparent and widely recognized as the problem of climate change. Both industrialized and developing countries are directly affected by the depletion of the ozone layer through increasing emissions of carbon dioxides, which produce the so-called greenhouse effect in the climate of the Earth, and by the increasing presence of substances in the atmosphere that cause acid rain and direct dangers to health.
It is therefore hardly a surprise that we have witnessed increasing international activity in this field. Several initiatives have been taken to launch concerted international action to combat atmospheric pollution in all its aspects, including climatic change. It is our view that effective strategies and policies should be developed by the international community as soon as possible in all fields relating to environment. That is a major undertaking that requires consolidated effort by the General Assembly and by the relevant United Nations specialized and other agencies. Environmental problems have a universal character. Any new activities should be streamlined with already ongoing action and well-established treaty-making procedures. The General Assembly must play a pivotal role in that effort.
Five months ago Finland hosted a Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer aid the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Those instruments, of 1985 and 1987 respectively, have this year already been found inadequate in light of the latest advances in knowledge. At the Conference the representatives of the more than 80 States present agreed unanimously to the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of  the Ozone Layer, which contains an ambitious undertaking to phase out completely the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000, or sooner if possible, and to phase out other ozone-depleting substances as soon as possible. We expect that undertaking to be converted into a legally binding decision at next year's meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Appropriate measures should also be undertaken to make environmentally sound substitutes widely available to developing countries as soon as possible.
In the field of environment protection the problems that are typical in the industrialized countries are often also found in the big urban centres of the developing countries. The problems that are now typical in many developing countries - such as soil erosion and the destruction of forests - illustrate mistakes already committed by earlier generations, most of all in Europe. We can therefore all learn from each other. There is information available about the environment and its protection, and about earlier mistakes. The available knowledge needs to be applied and converted into practical programmes, not only on the level of global strategies, but also on the level of regional, national and local development.
In our own development co-operation programmes, we in Finland have emphasized such activities as deforestation, where we feel that we have some experience and expertise. We see deforestation as urgent in order to help stop soil erosion, counteract the greenhouse effect and counterbalance the continued cutting of trees for fuel and for other immediate human needs. In this respect, the development of new and renewable soirees of energy is of crucial importance.
On a broader scale, we look forward to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We see it as representing probably the most important joint effort required of mankind during the remaining part of this century. This session of the General Assembly is called upon to take important decisions for the preparation of the Conference. In that connection, as in all our activities to face up to environmental problems, we in Finland will strongly emphasize the need to support the developing countries in order to ensure that their development is environmentally sustainable.
A large part of the burden, particularly for financing research and the introduction of new environmentally sound technologies, will have to be borne by the industrialized countries. We accept our part of this burden, knowing of course that all states will have to share in the efforts according to their capabilities. Since concern for the environment is global, this concern should in our opinion give a further incentive to all States without exception to involve themselves
actively in international co-operation for environmentally sound and sustainable development. We also think that the time is ripe for the preparation of structural reforms making the United Nations Organization more responsive to the problems of protecting the environment. My Government has an open mind regarding the various ideas that have been discussed. We would find it natural for this Assembly to take decisions ensuring environmental Questions a permanent and prominent place in the structure of the Organization.
One of the activities of the United Nations which has rightly gained prominence during this year is peace-keeping. At the present time, Finland is the biggest contributor of personnel to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Their total strength is close to 15,000, and the number of Finnish personnel is now almost 2,000. It is therefore with particular satisfaction that we in Finland share the pride felt in this house over the latest Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In co-operation with the other Nordic countries, Finland has this year taken steps to share with other interested States its experiences concerning the training and preparation of national contingents for peace-keeping tasks.
We are also satisfied at the reactivation of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. The accumulated experiences in this field have already grown to such an extent that it is high time indeed to make a thorough review of all practical proposals that may help to strengthen the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping.
In this connection, I wish to emphasize the importance of finding a lasting solution to the financial difficulties that still affect current peace-keeping operations, thus indirectly undermining the financial basis of the whole Organization. The idea of having sufficient financial reserves for peacemaking and peace-keeping, particularly for the start-up phase of operations, which my   predecessor put forward in his address to the General Assembly last year, has received support in a number of Quarters. I note in particular that the Secretary-General, in his own report to the General Assembly, has referred to the possibility of establishing a special reserve fund for peace-keeping, to be supported by all Member States. We hope that this idea can soon be followed up in practice with full respect for the principle of collective responsibility. The first condition, in our view, is that Member states should accept the principle of financing all operations without exception through assessed contributions and that they should pay all their assessed contributions in full and on time.
The principal factor explaining the recent growth in the participation of Finnish personnel in United Nations peace-keeping is the deployment of an enlarged battalion within the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. A sizable number of volunteer soldiers has thus been added to the two Finnish battalions and smaller units already serving in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Namibia is a major test for the United Nations. The beginnings of the UOTAG operations to implement Security Council resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia were unexpectedly rough and difficult. It is still too early to draw conclusions from the whole process of transition to independence, but we believe that the programme has been brought back on track thanks to the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General and the competent performance of the UNTAG personnel. Of course, many problems still remain to be solved and call for our unrelenting attention. We are looking forward with confidence to the moment when we can welcome independent Namibia into our midst as a Member State of the United Nations. For Finland, Namibia will be a major partner in our development co-operation.  The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a persistent threat to international security. The dangers of the absence of peace in the area are demonstrated almost daily. Repressive measures continue in the territories illegally occupied by Israel. The cycle of violence has not been broken. The
eking turmoil in Lebanon gives cause for deep concern. There must be a way to or the suffering of the Lebanese people by the common endeavours of the Lebanese themselves, the Arab League and the international community.
It is pressingly urgent that the way should be prepared towards an international peace conference and, further, to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. There is an almost universal recognition of the basic principles for a settlement. The right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries, as well as the right of the Palestinians to national determination, should be recognised. Democratic elections in the occupied territories could facilitate this process. If such elections are properly mentored and take place within the framework of a structured effort, they could provide a link in a process leading to a comprehensive settlement. The momentum for achieving a solution to this long-standing conflict will be lost unless all possible avenues are pursued vigorously and with an open mind. In this respect, the proposals made by President Mubarak of Egypt are welcome and merit serious consideration.
The United Nations has manifestly demonstrated its relevance and strengthened its role as a forum for co-ordinated international action. Yet the world Organization and its member States can do more. Serious global problems call for urgent global solutions. Only a re-invigorated United Nations can answer the challenges the world will inevitably face in the 1990s and beyond. Let us unite our forces to make the United Nations capable of meeting those challenges. 
","In the process of preparing both the development strategy and the special session emphasis should be on the development of human resources in all forms, including the recognition of a well-functioning private sector in balance with an effective public sector. To reach that goal, determined population policies, translated into national population plans as spelled out in the World Population Plan of Action, should be pursued vigorously.

Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure for me, on behalf of the delegation of Niger, to congratulate you moat warmly on your brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. By unanimously entrusting you with the onerous task of guiding its work the Assembly has wished to testify to the active role played in the international arena by your great country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which is united by old, fruitful, strong and varied link with the Republic of Niger in promoting and defending the ideals of international peace, harmony and security and in striving for greater equity and justice in international economic relations.
Your election is thus a confirmation of your outstanding qualities, an eminent diplomat, you are an expert in your field, a man whose experience, talent and strong convictions compel admiration and promise a fruitful outcome to our work. Finally, it is a tribute paid to Africa as a whole. I wish to assure you of the complete availability and co-operation of my delegation in helping you to accomplish your task.
To your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, we would like to express out full appreciation and gratitude for the wisdom, skill and efficiency with which he presided over the work of the forty-third session.
lb the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, I should like to repeat the whole-hearted support and encouragement of General Ali Saibou, President of the Supreme Council of National Guidance, Head of State, for the tireless efforts he is making on behalf of peace. We commend the dynamic work the Secretary-General has carried out at the head of this Organization, which he has now rehabilitated and whose authority, prestige and credibility he has restored.
Finally, I welcome Mr. Ronald Spiers, the new Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, who succeeds Ambassador Reed. We wish him every success in the accomplishment of his new task.
The sessions of the General Assembly are opportunities for the international community to make further progress in the quest for peace, justice and harmony among peoples in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter. It is in this spirit that the delegation of Niger intends once again to make its contribution to the bread discussion of problems of concern to humanity.
Swift and profound changes are taking place in the international arena. We are seeing political, economic, social, cultural and even ideological changes which are shaping and foreshadowing international relations and the new stakes and challenges of the next century. These changes are sure to have a decisive influence on the future of nations and peoples.
The new dynamic in the feature of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly with the signature and entry into force of the Treaty on the Elimination of Their Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, is grounds for hope. That agreement and the thaw in relations between the two super-Powers has created a general climate of co-operation and detente and has helped to prepare the way for the settlement of several regional and local conflicts.
The treaties and agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States are basic attainments} they testify to the political will of those two countries to curb the danger which the arms race represents for mankind. We must however note that the danger continues because the means of warfare are of necessity lethal, are still considerable and are increasingly sophisticated. For that reason the two super-Powers should intensify and pursue, with greater determination and will, their negotiations on the reduction of their stockpiles both nuclear and conventional.
In this respect we are pleased with the constructive proposals made a few days ago from this rostrum, by the President of the United States of America and the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs respectively, with regard to the elimination of chemical weapons and of conventional weapons. These proposals, if accepted by both parties, would, we believe, help to promote substantial progress towards general and complete disarmament.
The survival of mankind is our common responsibility and implies that we must avoid a nuclear disaster, which is still possible, by significantly reversing present trends. It is certainly frustrating to note the state of the world today and to see that today we have a striking if not repugnant paradox on the one hand there is the exponential increase in military budgets, and arsenals and on the other there is the chronic poverty and wretchedness of many in the world We must give full weight to the Action Programme adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which provides for the creation of institutional financial mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of resources saved through disarmament measures to economic and social development activities.
This session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when significant and encouraging progress has been noted in many regional conflicts, some of which have been controlled and virtually settled thanks to the merits of dialogue and negotiation, while others are on the right path with good chances of success. However, the persistence of stubborn hotbeds of tension or situations of injustice and the appearance or intensification of certain disputes still pose a dangerous threat to international peace and security in many regions of the world.
We must work tirelessly, and persevere in the quest for and consolidation of peace. He must take advantage of this thaw in international relations to make significant advances towards the realization of our peoples' legitimate aspiration to peace, justice and human dignity.
In Africa, the situation in Namibia and South Africa continues to centre on the long-awaited outcome of the Namibian people's heroic struggle for independence and on tine persistence of the despicable system of apartheid. The international community's tireless efforts are finally about to bear fruits the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia has been under way since 1 April 1989. Yet it is more indispensable than ever before to show determination, vigilance and solidarity to prevent the Pretoria racist regime from crushing our efforts.
Unfortunately, I must condemn yet again tine intimidation and harassment against the freedom-fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SHAFO), the reprisals perpetrated by the sinister Koevoet forces, the manipulation of electoral rolls, the assassination of Namibian patriots and SHAFO leaders, such as the 12 September murder of Anton Lubowski. All these acts testify to the disarray of the racist regime and remind us that there are still many real dangers that the process will be derailed, and that constant vigilance is required.
It is the duty of the Organization, the permanent members of the Security Council and the entire international community to ensure that the spirit and the letter of Security Council resolutions 435 (1578) and 632 (1989) are scrupulously respected by all parties and that the Namibian people has the opportunity and means to elect a Government of Its choice next month freely, peacefully and without manoeuvres, intimidation or coercion.
In South Africa itself, apartheid persists, The new political leadership of the country is aiming to win time through various subterfuges. He must not be Misled by recent declarations of purely superficial constitutional reforms or by the pseudo-elections of 6 September last. They leave untouched the real problem: the perpetuation of the apartheid system, which denies the black majority the right to participate fully in the political and democratic management of its country.
Mr. President, as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid you are very well aware that apartheid cannot be reformed. It is a disgrace to humanity and an anachronism of world civilization; it must be dismantled, pure and simple. But we note that the friends of the South African regime still hesitate to adopt bold sanctions against the apartheid regime. They must understand and weigh the danger to themselves of stubborn support - even passive support - for a system founded on inequality, exploitation and the denial of human rights.
For that reason, Niger appeals again to the international community to maintain and indeed increase its pressure on the South African regime, so the comprehensive mandatory sanctions ordered by the Security Council and the General Assembly in the relevant resolutions can be effectively imposed against South Africa. Only such sanctions will make it see reason and lift its policy of internal repression and destabilization of neighbouring States, lift the bans that hobble the anti-apartheid movement, and immediately and unconditionally free all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, Today more than ever before, this is a matter of a true social pact and a duty of genuine solidarity for the international community vis-Ã -vis the South African people and all the peoples of southern Africa.
We call on the international community to support fully the conclusions reached by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which met at Harare on 21 August and adopted a declaration on the peace process in southern Africa. We call on it firmly to support the Gbadolite agreements of 22 June last and all the efforts to restore peace in Angola, and to encourage similar initiatives for national reconciliation and the restoration of peace in Mozambique,
A local conflict that has just exploded on our continent is causing us great concern and sadness, for it concerns two fraternal countries that are dear to us two countries that should stand united and cleave to one another; two countries members of the organization for the Development of the Senegal River, the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel, the West African Economic Community, the Economic Community of West African States, the OAU, the organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.
As a member of the ministerial mediation commission established by the organization of African Unity, Niger is working with the other member countries towards the prompt and final settlement of this unfortunate affair. We therefore take this opportunity to renew our appeal to Senegal and Mauritania to refrain from any action that could increase tension, and to co-operate fully with the African mediation commission in its efforts to restore as soon as possible between the two peoples the understanding, harmony, fraternity, solidarity and common destiny to which geography, history and the Islamic faith destine - I was about to say doom - them.
I am pleased to note that between Chad and Libya - two other fraternal countries that are neighbours of Niger - dialogue is continuing and strengthening ever time, thus promoting a comprehensive, final settlement of the dispute that has long set them against one another and that has cost their peoples so dearly. Niger welcomed the conclusion on 31 August of the Algiers agreement, which consolidated the cease-fire and ushered in a new era of peace, mutual trust and fraternal
co-operation for the two countries. We congratulate them and urge them to sustain this momentum in the interest of their peoples arid the entire sub region.
In Western Sahara, the process begun by the Secretary-General's peace plan and conducted jointly with the current Chairman of the OAU is under way, and we support it. We urge the parties involved in this painful conflict to continue and indeed intensify their efforts to create conditions that would favour the organization under United Nations auspices of a referendum on self-determination.
In the Middle East, the Palestinian people is heroically continuing its resistance to illegal occupation and repression. The conditions, the framework and the means for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East are well known. They include the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, the strict implementation in that connection of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the convoking under United Nations auspices of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). There is no possible alternative to those conditions and their complete implementation} otherwise there can be no fair and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Along with the rest of the international community, Niger welcomed the peace initiative announced on 13 December 1988 in Geneva, and the many peaceful overtures made by the PLO. We therefore regret the lack of a positive response from the Israeli Government to the Palestinian side's constructive position. None the less, we hope that both sides will show realism and responsibility by accepting the 10-point proposal put forward by the President of Egypt, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, we feel that proposal could create conditions for a constructive and satisfactory outcome. In the meantime, we urgently appeal for strict respect for the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, in order to protect civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories against the repression practised by the Israeli forces trying - vainly - to stifle the intifadah.
We continue to be concerned by the tragedy the people of Lebanon has endured for the past 15 years. A State Member of this Organization is truly wasting away. Can we remain powerless and inactive in the face of that unacceptable situation? The international community must do everything in its power to preserve the identity, unity, territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon, and to achieve national reconciliation amongst all its sons. Niger is endeavouring to do this. We support fully the efforts made by the League of Arab States and the Tripartite Committee which it set up to find a solution to this tragedy.
We are pleased to note that there has been a real abatement in the conflict between Iran and Iraq over the last year. My country again declares its support for the clear-sighted efforts made by the Secretary-General and urges the two parties to co-operate fully with him, not only to consolidate the cease-fire but also to make progress towards a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement to the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).
Regarding Afghanistan, Niger is pleased at the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements, which made possible the withdrawal of foreign troops from that countryâ We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts to facilitate a comprehensive, political settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva agreements and General Assembly resolution 43/20. The return to real peace in Afghanistan requires strict respect for the right of the Afghan people to decide independently its own fate, and requires respect for its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and of its status as a non-aligned State.
We are also watching closely the development of the situation in Kampuchea, particularly the decision on the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. The International Conference held in Paris from 30 July to 3 August 1989, offers, in my delegation's view, a timely opportunity for ail the parties involved and directly concerned to find, through dialogue and reflection, a comprehensive, honourable and definitive solution to the tragedy of Cambodia.
Even if the results of that Conference did not measure up to the hopes we had placed in them, the Conference is certainly an important step towards a peaceful solution. The Cambodian people must be able to determine freely their own destiny without any foreign interference. Dialogue amongst all the sons of Cambodia must continue and must be intensified. In this respect Niger welcomes and encourages the commendable efforts made by the French and Indonesian Co-Chairmen.
The aspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification are yet to be realized. We strongly encourage the two parties to continue the contacts and the dialogue which they have begun with a view to the reunification of Korea without foreign interference. In regard to Cyprus we are pleased with the efforts made by the Secretary-General through his Special Representative. The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island must be guaranteed and its national unity and non-aligned status must be respected.
Concerning Central America we are following and we welcome the praiseworthy efforts made by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to eliminate the combined impact of tension and violence and to establish the basis for true peace and co-operation. From the Contadora Agreements to those of Tesoro Beach and Tela, together with the Esquipulas II Agreements, we can gauge the determination with which the heads of State of the region are seeking means to establish a true peace. All of their initiatives and their efforts deserve the full support of this Assembly.
They deserve it all the more since a terrible scourge which is afflicting all of humanity and jeopardizing the fabric of society, has over the last few months and in a brutal way, focused world attention on this region of the world. Indeed, the fight against drug trafficking in Latin America has become total war, the outcome of which will determine the capacity of the international community to display strength, determination and solidarity. This challenge involves, without any doubt, the fate and future of mankind as a whole.
Niger gives its support to Colombia and to all countries involved in this battle, world-wide, and urges the international community to set in motion a consistent strategy to win this struggle, which involves and challenges us all.
Another problem, indeed another scourge, which is equally disturbing and whose innocent victims are increasing in numbers throughout the world, is that of international terrorism. Last year. Pan Am flight 103, from London to New York, crashed in Scotland, with several hundreds of victims, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia. On behalf of Niger, we pay a tribute once again to his memory. A few months ago Colonel Higgins, a man working for peace, was assassinated in cold blood. Recently, an aircraft of the UTA company, on a flight between Brazzaville and Paris, exploded in mid-air over territory of my country, killing 171 innocent victims. These are only a few examples, but unfortunately there are many others. On behalf of President Ali Saibou and the people of Niger, I express here to all the States whose nationals perished in the tragedy of this UTA flight our deep sympathy and our sincere condolences.
Terrorism is the evil of our century. It strikes out blindly and indiscriminately. He must launch a real, unified crusade, a sacred union even, to combat terrorism, which today transcends national borders and political and ideological differences. Niger and its government are determined to make their contribution, however modest, to the struggle, which affects us all.
The present climate of detente, which has prevailed for at least a year in international relations, should encourage the world to reflect further on the ways
and means of restoring peace wherever it has been disturbed, to preserve it everywhere it is threatened, and to strengthen it wherever it has been established.
The period of calm in the political arena is contrasted, however, very sharply with the world economic situation characterized, unfortunately, by a profound structural imbalance. In fact, unequal development between North and South is the main contradiction in the world today. It is clear however that peace and security are directly linked with development. Thus the climate of detente which prevails at this time in the world would be vain and have no future if the developing countries continue to have to deal with difficulties which are constantly aggravated through imbalance, inequality and flagrant injustice in their economic relations with the industrialized countries.
The gap between developed countries and developing countries is widening day by day. Whereas in the North there is talk of growth and expansion, in the South the talk is still about food self-sufficiency and structural adjustment. Men, women and children of Africa, of Asia, and of Latin America and the Caribbean, are living through the tragedy of hunger, poverty, illiteracy, natural disasters such as drought, desertification, plaques of locusts, cyclones, and so on. Societies that are just surviving, societies that are overwhelmed: that is the harsh reality of developing countries, of which, sadly, Africa has the greatest number.
The causes of this trend are to be found essentially in the collapse in commodity prices, the deterioration in terms of trade and the crushing weight of external debt. These phenomena, which have led to a net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries, and the multilateral financial institutions, are stripping States in the South of every chance of development, thus making them incapable of creating the investments necessary for real and lasting growth.
Given this situation, our Governments have undertaken profound economic reforms. These reforms, carried out at great social and political cost, have not enjoyed, as was hoped and promised, the full support of the international community. Less than two years from the time it was, theoretically, to come to an end, the five-year United Nations programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has still not really started.
As the Secretary-General stressed in his annual report on the work of the organization, failure to find a solution could lead to a collapse of the social and political structures in many developing countries.
Whatever the case, it is urgently necessary that particular attention be given to the most vulnerable countries: the least developed countries, countries affected by drought and desertification, countries suffering from natural scourges and countries suffering from being land-locked, for whom a revival of economic and social development is a necessity.
First, new and lasting solutions to the problem oÂ£ debt must be found through continuing consideration by and co-operation between creditor and debtor countries in all appropriate forums. In this regard, Niger welcomes the plans and initiatives so far put forward and supports the idea of an international conference on Africa's external debt, as advocated by the organization of African Unity. We welcome the decisions first of Canada, in 1987, and then of France this year, followed by those of Belgium and Italy, to cancel all debt relating to development assistance. Niger hopes - and this is our interest in an international conference on the debt - that those unilateral actions will be followed by collective measures, the fruit of a general and formal agreement between debtor countries and their creditor partners, both bilateral and multilateral.
Secondly, we must make a methodical and determined search for a new, more just and balanced international economic order in which economic and social security is guaranteed to all peoples. That new international economic order can be sought and achieved only within the framework of the North-South dialogue, which must be resumed.
In the same context we welcome and firmly support the proposal made in July 1989 by the Presidents of Egypt, Senegal and Venezuela and the Prime Minister of India concerning the organization of regular summit consultations between North and South on problems of common interest to the two hemispheres.
In this connection, the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular the revitalisation of economic growth and development in developing countries, to be held in April 1990, will constitute, we believe, a propitious occasion and an appropriate framework for the reinvigoration of the North-South dialogue. This applies also to the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Paris in 1990.
We cherish the hope that these conferences and initiatives will contribute to the effective resumption of the North-South dialogue by offering the possibility of achieving an agreement on the nature of the problems facing developing countries and the approach to be taken towards solving them. Niger intends to participate actively and to make its contribution through concrete proposals that could lead to the emergence of a new era of healthy co-operation between North and South.
Moreover, we are particularly interested in the current negotiations on the new Lome convention, which in our view should serve as a model both as regards efforts to stabilize the export earnings of developing countries, assistance in the diversification of their exports and the opening of markets to their products, and as regards development assistance.
1 should like to conclude this section by expressing a concern that is widely shared by the countries represented here. I refer to the problem of children.
The difficult economic situation in developing countries is the reason for the situation of children in those countries, and particularly in Africa being so worrying, despite the importance and priority which our Governments accord to the protection and well-being of children, since they represent the future.
The results of efforts made by members of the international community, with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international organizations, to ensure the survival, protection and full development of the potential of children are encouraging. It is essential, however, to pursue and intensify our efforts collectively. That is why Niger firmly supports not only the idea of convening with urgency a world summit devoted to children, but also the conclusion and adoption as a top priority by the General Assembly at the present session of a draft convention on the rights of the child. The environment crisis, which is felt throughout the world and seriously threatens life on our planet, is a question to which the international community should pay urgent attention. Today, the degradation of the ozone layer, the heating of the atmosphere and climatic changes are as much a reality as deforestation, desertification of arable lands, pollution of water and the atmosphere, the disappearance of fauna and flora, toxic wastes, and the transfer of hazardous wastes to developing countries.
The means of avoiding ecological disaster exist. We must use the available technology, improve it, and share it. To this end, it is imperative that Member States draw up co-ordinated plans of action to resolve the environmental crisis. That is a joint responsibility that calls for solidarity and it must be said that it is the duty of the industrialized countries to prevent or limit the damage caused to the world environment and to help our developing countries to achieve healthy development.
The United Nations conference on environment and development proposed for 1992 will provide an excellent opportunity to work out agreed action at the world level and to define new principles of international law concerning the protection and conservation of the environment and, in particular, effective international measures to prohibit the transfer of hazardous wastes to the territories of other countries.
As everybody knows and as is true of many African countries, the economic and social situation is the main and constant source of concern for the Government of Niger. Nevertheless, I am happy to inform the Assembly that President Ali Saibou has undertaken action aimed at the political evolution of our country with the ultimate objective of a return to constitutional life. Following the adoption by referendum of the National Charter in July 1987, the process of setting up apolitical system as the basis for the Second Republic of Niger entered its final, decisive phase with the establishment, in May 1989, of the National Movement for the Society in Development and the adoption by referendum on 24 September of a new Constitution.
As the President, General Ali Saibou, said, the National Movement for the Society in Development will be the appropriate forum for political expression in which the women and men of Niger will strive to affirm and defend their political, economic and social rights. The goal is the realization of participatory democracy guaranteeing the free expression of ideological opinions and sentiments, in order to achieve a constructive political awareness and the consolidation of a stable and integrated regime involving all the components of our nation.
The Constitution reaffirms the law character and republican nature of the State and makes Niger a State of law that respects the fundamental freedoms of individuals. It ensures the equality of all before the law and enshrines the principle of the sovereignty of the people.
In that Constitution the people of Niger reaffirms its will to co-operate in friendship with all peoples that cherish peace, justice and freedom. It reiterates its total and permanent readiness to seek, with all the nations of the world, solutions to the innumerable ills that afflict the international community and to construct a world of peace, justice and progress in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
Legislative and presidential elections will take place on 10 December next, with direct universal suffrage, and will complete the process of a return to normal constitutional life in Niger.
That is my delegation's contribution to the general debate at the forty-fourth session, which we wish the most outstanding success. We hope that it will  strengthen the unshakable faith of our Governments in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. We hope that it will instil in each of our peoples a planetary patriotism thanks to which we shall be able to succeed in our. undertaking and build slowly but surely a single, indivisible world of peace, happiness and human dignity.  
","It is certainly frustrating to note the state of the world today and to see that today we have a striking if not repugnant paradox on the one hand there is the exponential increase in military budgets, and arsenals and on the other there is the chronic poverty and wretchedness of many in the world We must give full weight to the Action Programme adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which provides for the creation of institutional financial mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of resources saved through disarmament measures to economic and social development activities. We call on it firmly to support the Gbadolite agreements of 22 June last and all the efforts to restore peace in Angola, and to encourage similar initiatives for national reconciliation and the restoration of peace in Mozambique,
A local conflict that has just exploded on our continent is causing us great concern and sadness, for it concerns two fraternal countries that are dear to us two countries that should stand united and cleave to one another; two countries members of the organization for the Development of the Senegal River, the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel, the West African Economic Community, the Economic Community of West African States, the OAU, the organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.

44,1989,URY,"ï»¿
During the debate at the fortieth session of the General Assembly four years ago, President Sanguinetti announced to the world community from this very rostrum that Uruguay had resumed its traditional path of political democracy, and was determined to respect and to enforce respect domestically for all human rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic, and further announced his firm resolve to resume active participation on the global stage of international relations in the pursuit of peace, universal respect for human rights and the equality of all nations, based on respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.
Six months prior to the conclusion of President Sanguinetti's constitutional term, I have the honour to mount the same rostrum to announce to this international community that today those intentions have been fully realized.
Indeed, within a few weeks, elections will be held in Uruguay to elect all the authorities who will be responsible for the destiny of the country for the next five years. This fact, commonplace in the political tradition of a democratic country, is particularly significant in out case, since it represents the culmination of a period of democratic recovery during which full respect for the Constitution has been restored? all individual rights have been scrupulously observed, and national reconciliation has been achieved, inter alia by a general amnesty ratified by popular mandate. Law and justice have been restored, and the country has been rescued from a declining economic situation through the vigorous revitalization of the external sector and the application of stabilizing policies which have allowed reasonable product growth, a decrease in unemployment and an increase in real earnings.
On the international front, Uruguay has honoured all its commitments, including those of a financial nature which entailed - then and today - considerable sacrifices. It has actively contributed, at times beyond the power of its political weight and its material resources, to efforts aimed at reinforcing international peace, security and co-operation. It has embarked upon a firm policy of regional and sub regional integration and participates actively with other democracies in the hemisphere to co-ordinate positions in order to satisfy our common interests. In short, the Government of Uruguay is acting on the international scene, secure in the moral and political authority it derives from the right to represent a free, democratic, stable and peace-loving society. This task of democratic consolidation has been successful but also extremely difficult. As President Sanguinetti said to this Assembly in 1985:
'Democracy is a fragile flower; ... it only grows aid survives in the right soil and the right climate. A genuine democracy based on respect for the individual and an the periodical, free advice of the people can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. ... When this condition is not fulfilled, and poverty and unemployment prevail, violence emerges and is unleashed, the powers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil, the fabric of society disintegrates and, in the international sphere, political loyalties become erratic.' (A/40/PV.6, p. 12)
Indeed, democracy is never limited to a purely political dimension, nor is it a sufficient condition to ensure freedom for all the people.
The economic and social component of a democratic society is what ultimately determines its feasibility aid stability. It is for this reason that the question posed by the foreign Ministers of the Group of 8 when considering the problem of foreign debt is a valid one today: How much poverty can freedom withstand?
Like democracy in other Latin American countries and other regions of the world, democracy in Uruguay has been constantly threatened by a severe economic crisis unprecedented in its history.
We are aware - and this is always worth repeating - of our share of responsibility in the task of overcoming the crisis and promoting development and economic growth. We know that that is possible only through our own efforts, through the formulation and application of our own policies and, particularly, through our own sacrifices. But we are also aware that, despite the social and political cost of these adjustment processes, the expected benefits will not be obtained without greater participation and commitment by the industrialized countries, particularly in the areas of international finance and trade.
The issue of underdevelopment, therefore, remains the major world problem faced by mankind. The growth achieved by a few Asian countries cannot hide the fact that there has been significant regression in the social indicators of many countries in Latin America and Africa. That bears eloquent testimony to the seriousness of the situation and the political risk to their governing institutions, and consequently to world peace.
The vast foreign debt which weighs so heavily on many of our countries has reversed the flow of financial resources, which now runs from South to North. The task of turning the tide cannot be delayed, since this debt is paralysing all our efforts to achieve economic development and democratic stability.
It is encouraging to note that creditor countries have new accepted the principle of shared responsibility in the foreign-debt problem, and have agreed that this problem is not simply financial but also political and social. It is also noteworthy and encouraging that creditor Governments appear willing to consider formulas to help the constrained economies of debtor nations.
In this respect, the agreement between Mexico and its international bank creditors has set a precedent regarding the feasibility of the Brady philosophy and has aroused legitimate hopes and expectations in the rest of the debtor nations.
Without a pragmatic approach to the debt problem there will be no development and no economic growth; without these prerequisites it will be very difficult to continue to believe in democracy, and without democracy world stability and peace will be very hard to maintain.
What we need today is a revolutionary change in our ideas and policies with respect to international economics, ultimately leading to the formulation of a new development strategy. The starting point of that strategy should be recognition of the interdependence of all States, whatever their size or economic or military power; and the objective should be to ensure that this interdependence is viewed as guaranteeing greater predictability and stability in world trade and economic relations and a more just distribution of the benefits.
This new international strategy for development should be dynamic, flexible and, above all, concrete and precise in the formulation of measures designed to fight poverty, to eliminate protectionism and discrimination in international trade, and to facilitate access by all developing countries to technology and to the financial and economic markets of industrialized nations.
The environmental dimension should be an essential ingredient in the new international development strategy. The deterioration of the environment has become a matter of concern to the entire international community and there is no doubt it will continue to be a matter of concern in the years to come.
There can be no doubt that the environment must, be protected and that each State must assume responsibility and take action in this respect for its own well-being and for that of other peoples of the world. But it is also true that
the correct solution to the problem requires sincere and broad international co-operation to ensure that the cost of protecting the environment is not borne by only a few countries which ate still struggling for full development of their un-exploited natural resources. In no case - and this is more important still - should protection of the environment become a new form of conditionality to which the sovereign decisions of countries still requiring international co-operation for their development would be subordinated.
In summary, Uruguay is conscious of the urgent need to protect the environment-, but we are also aware that this is a task requiring the participation and efforts of the entire international community and that it should be carried out in a way compatible with the national sovereignty of all nations.
However, the implementation of a development policy that guarantees both the protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources requires the provision of financial resources and appropriate technologies not available to all the countries in the world.
As we stated last year and repeat today: the technological dependence of the developing countries is not only a factor inhibiting their economic development, but also as a serious threat to their political sovereignty as that posed by foreign aggression.
The cost of transferring financial and technological resources to developing countries represents barely a marginal fraction of the funds used by the super-Powers in the arms race, for which they invoke reasons of national security. They forget that reasons of national survival would make it mandatory for them to allocate more than a marginal fraction of that overall expenditure to the transfer of resources and technology to developing countries, thereby facilitating their
participation in the common task of protecting both world peace and the quality of the environment.
In dealing with the question of the environment, the international community must resort to the basic mechanism of co-operation between nations because we are faced with a common danger, affecting us all, and there is no political system or degree of development or military Power than can give any State the slightest immunity against it.
Unfortunately, it is not only dangers to the environment that indiscriminately affect all nations and peoples. There are other reasons forcing us to resort to and develop the mechanisms of global solidarity and co-operation. Terrorism and drug trafficking, which at times appear to be complementary phenomena, continue to wreak destruction and havoc, despite the universal revulsion they arouse.
Uruguay unequivocally condemns terrorism. For us, any terrorist act is inhuman and cruel, violates the most sacred human rights and reveals the basest and most destructive feelings of men. There is no purpose, no cause, no issue, however noble, that can justify the commission of a terrorist act. For that reason, Uruguay will contribute, without qualifications based on motives or purposes, to efforts directed at establishing new legal measures and at strengthening existing ones providing for the eradication of this scourge from the face of the earth.
With respect to drug trafficking, we are concerned at the rate at which it has expanded and at the vast power behind it, but at the same time we are encouraged to see that the governments of consumer nations have become aware of their responsibilities and that producer nations have shouldered the risks involved in an open war against drug traffickers. In this connection, it is my duty, and my pleasure, to express to the Government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas and to the people of Colombia the solidarity of the Government of Uruguay in respect of recent events in our sister Republic, and our admiration for the courage with which Colombians are tackling this problem.
The political climate that now prevails is perhaps the most propitious in four decades for the successful initiation and implementation of undertakings necessitating the willingness of Governments to co-operate with each other. Ideological dogmatism and political inflexibility appear to be losing ground in the face of realism and common sense. Over the last few months, we have embarked on a new era of dialogue and collaboration, which has translated into a cessation of hostilities, the reaching of agreements, and the establishment of contacts and channels of communication. All of this has led to the solution, or imminent solution, of several regional conflicts.
The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq; the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan that has already taken place; the recent efforts to normalize the situation in Kampuchea; the December 1988 agreements on southern Africa and the beginning of the self-determination process in Namibia; the agreements on New Caledonia; the contacts concerning Western Sahara; the new surge in the Central American peace process following the regional presidential summit last August; and the promising resumption of dialogue between Argentina and the United Kingdom with a view to settling their differences directly - these are manifestations of this desire for peace, and proof of the sterility and futility of confrontation, intolerance and misguided nationalism.

This new spirit is evident also in the changes introduced by numerous countries in the principles and objectives of their domestic policies, which have led them to greater openness, both internally and externally, thereby strengthening the prospects for international peace and co-operation. 1 am referring to political evolution on the domestic front in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, as well as to the steps taken towards democracy by the last authoritarian regimes in South America, which are evidence of a less dogmatic political vision that, fortunately, appears to be spreading in almost all regions of the world.
However, there remain areas in which the voices of peace go unheeded, First, the human-rights situation in the world is still far from satisfactory. The international community knows that the important progress made in the political field will remain precarious while vast sectors of the world's peoples are unable fully to enjoy their human rights.
There can be no doubt whatsoever that no progress - whether economic, social, political or moral â will have a firm foundation so long as any vestiges of racism and racial discrimination remain, and in particular while practices such as apartheid continue. South Africa's persistence in disregarding the resolutions of the United Nations will not stifle the persistence of the rest of the world in reclaiming for that country the full force of the equality and dignity of the human race.
The work of the United Nations in developing human rights and establishing the means of guaranteeing respect for them must continue, with the support of the international community. A very important step has been taken with the drafting of the convention on the rights of the child, which we trust will soon become, for every State, the appropriate ethical and legal framework for improving the status of children.
The Middle East conflict continues to threaten world peace and to cost the parties involved a high price in human life and in moral and material damage. Nevertheless, signals are beginning to come from both sides - signals that are helping to generate the climate necessary for a negotiated solution. For Israel, this would mean lasting peace within safe borders, and, for the Palestinians, the possibility of exercising freely their right to self-determination.
In this region, we are also particularly concerned about the tragic situation in Lebanon - a country with which we have many links, and whose long-suffering people are the victims of an unjust and senseless war, with the Resulting death and devastation with which we are all too familiar.
Uruguay has raised its voice in the past, and does so again, to call on all the parties involved to intensify their efforts to achieve a final solution to the conflict. This implies the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese territory and the harmonization, by democratic means, of domestic differences. In this regard, we wish every success for the mediation undertaken by several heads of State of the League of Arab States. We trust that the pursuit of peace in Lebanon will succeed and that this country will once again be as prosperous and peaceful as it once was.
These problems, as well as other situations that threaten peace, are this year, as in previous years, difficult challenges to which the General Assembly should respond by trying to reconcile the specific interests of each nation with
the general interests of the international community. We are aware that this is a task fraught with difficulties, but at the same time we are encouraged because we know, Mr. President, that under your enlightened and expert direction, we shall achieve the desired results.
I should like to conclude by expressing our sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his intelligent and effective presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session, and also to the Secretary-General, whose dynamism, tact and commitment have strengthened the role of his office within the Organization and have been an essential factor in enhancing its prestige through his successful intervention in the peaceful solution of a number of regional conflicts.
","ï»¿
During the debate at the fortieth session of the General Assembly four years ago, President Sanguinetti announced to the world community from this very rostrum that Uruguay had resumed its traditional path of political democracy, and was determined to respect and to enforce respect domestically for all human rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic, and further announced his firm resolve to resume active participation on the global stage of international relations in the pursuit of peace, universal respect for human rights and the equality of all nations, based on respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. This new international strategy for development should be dynamic, flexible and, above all, concrete and precise in the formulation of measures designed to fight poverty, to eliminate protectionism and discrimination in international trade, and to facilitate access by all developing countries to technology and to the financial and economic markets of industrialized nations. This new spirit is evident also in the changes introduced by numerous countries in the principles and objectives of their domestic policies, which have led them to greater openness, both internally and externally, thereby strengthening the prospects for international peace and co-operation. The international community knows that the important progress made in the political field will remain precarious while vast sectors of the world's peoples are unable fully to enjoy their human rights. I should like to conclude by expressing our sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his intelligent and effective presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session, and also to the Secretary-General, whose dynamism, tact and commitment have strengthened the role of his office within the Organization and have been an essential factor in enhancing its prestige through his successful intervention in the peaceful solution of a number of regional conflicts."
44,1989,ZWE,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to express my delegation's satisfaction and pleasure at your election, Sir, to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. The unanimity of that decision reflects not only your own distinguished record as Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative of your country to the United Nations but also the prestige of your country, Nigeria, of which all of us in Africa are proud.
The outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, shouldered the responsibility of his office with distinction in a momentous and difficult year. We wish to acknowledge our debt to him.
Our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, has been at the head of our Organization during some of its roost troubled and also some of its most productive and successful years. The turnaround in the fortunes of the United Nations during his watch owes much to the skill of the helmsman and we want to reassure him of our continued confidence.
The current session of the General Assembly must seriously address itself to problems affecting the world economy. In the vital field of international economic relations, the fresh breeze that has led to such excitement in international political relations has not even made a ripple. The direction of the world economy is still determined by a small circle of rich and powerful nations for which short-term expediency and the requirements of individual national economies have all too often taken precedence over the steps required for a healthier world economy from which all States would benefit in the long run. For the smaller countries the result has been a collapse in commodity prices causing severe prejudicial terms of trade, where several times the volume and quality of produce is now required to purchase the same amount of manufactured goods from the North than was required only a few years ago. In addition, the necessary borrowing on the part of the developing countries, coupled with high interest rates, has resulted in a debilitating debt-service burden for those countries that has culminated in a net reverse transfer of resources from South to North in the order of nearly $50 billion annually according to the calculations of international financial institutions. Fifty billion dollars annually is a very big amount to owe and we ate informed that more money is still continuing to flow from the developing countries to the developed countries. 
How can we, in all conscience, talk of kinder, gentler times and continue to countenance the continual transfer of such a phenomenal amount of resources from the poor and the hungry to the rich and the affluent? We welcome the positive developments on the international political stage and we believe that all peoples should enjoy political and civil rights. Conscience, however, enjoins us to submit that these rights are not enough. People have economic and social rights as well: the right to good health, the right to food and shelter, and above all the tight to a decent standard of living. It should be the lot of no one to suffer the degradations of illiteracy and poverty. Hunan rights are a package the elements of which are mutually reinforcing, and the denial of any of them weakens the entire package. A poor man, a sick man and an illiterate man are just as manacled as the man who is denied individual freedom or the right of free speech. It is the package that is important, for it goes beyond the selective, and at times cynical, championing of this or that right to the core of the purpose of existenceÂ·, the tight to a decent and meaningful life. Any attempt to separate one from the other or to compartmentalize these rights and champion one right at the expense of the other is to sow confusion and set the stage for futile recriminations.
All States represented in the Assembly should subscribe to that view and attempt to pursue the objective of a good and decent existence for all human beings. The pursuit of a healthier world economy, of growth and development of the poorer countries and of fairer terms of trade between the North and the South is fundamentally a struggle for human rights and for the tight of people to a decent existence.
In our interdependent world that struggle must involve a concerted approach, including greater recourse to multilateral mechanisms on the part of all States. Nations must act together to solve the global and interrelated problems of the world economy, as low commodity prices, high interest rates and acute external Indebtedness. The politics of inclusion that appear to be gaining ground in international political relations, particularly through professions by the big Powers of their readiness to give a larger role in the management of international affairs to the United Nations, should also be reflected in international economic relations.
The initiative taken by the developing countries in urging the Assembly to hold a special session on economic co-operation, in particular for the revitalization of the growth and development of developing countries, in April 1990, is a timely development. The special session should focus on the need to renew the stalled North-South dialogue and on the direction of the world economy. I am pleased to note that the recent summit Conference of the Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, held at Belgrade, endorsed this suggestion and all the member States of the Non-Aligned Movement will be co-operating in the exercise. In this era, when economic mega-blocs are in the process of being formed in North America and in Europe, and where East and West are drawing closer in many spheres, it is essential that developing countries are not left out of the discussions and the mechanisms that will affect the future course of international economic and political relations. We also note that preparations are under way for the elaboration of the international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. We wish to stress the complementarity we see between that process and next year's special session on economic co-operation, to which I have already referred.
Following the 1986 special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa, the Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. That Programme represented a compact between the African countries and the international community, especially the donor countries. The African countries were to take steps to redress their economies through structural adjustment programmes, which they have done - often at a significant social and political cost - and the international community undertook to create an international environment conducive to African recovery by facilitating an increase in commodity prices and resource 21ows to the continent. The mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme, annexed to resolution 43/27 of 1988, clearly states that the international community has not kept its side of the bargain. The African States have made the adjustments that were required of them. Let me echo the words of Mr. Michael Manley, Prime Minister of Jamaica, when he sand recently: ,We have done everything that was asked of us. But what has the other side done?, 
Commodity prices have continued to fall and resource flows to Africa have not increased in any appreciable way. Given the sacrifices the African countries have made to keep their part of the bargain, it is important that the Programme be made o work. Since the review of the Programme will take place in 1991, and the programme itself is to run only up to 1990, it is important that the Programme be mandated to run until the final review, and we hope that decision will be taken at this session. 
Problems of the environment affect the entire globe, which is our common abode, and many speakers have referred to this important factor. From the depletion of the ozone layer to the poisoning of the atmosphere and the rivers, the degradation of the environment affects all of us. The global warming of the general climate affects com tries in Europe, in the Americas, Africa and everywhere. For us in Africa the problem of the environment is important as we face what one representative has described here as the encroaching deserts. We have heard from many delegations of the encroachment of the desert on to their own fertile lands. We also have the related problem of the dumping of nuclear and toxic wastes which have been the subject of resolutions by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the International Atomic Energy Agency and the General Assembly itself, last year. Greater responsibility is needed in the way the world uses its natural resources and disposes of the dangerous waste products of its factories. In the last year representatives will have read press reports about the very dangerous dumping of wastes in certain African countries, which action was rightly condemned by the OAU and other internal forums. We therefore welcome the intention to hold a special international conference on the environment in 1992. 
We are also aware that all too often the weak ate made to pay for the sins of the strong - if only because controlling the strong is so much more difficult. It is important that the burden attendant upon safeguarding the environment should be shared judiciously according to resource usage, waste production and need. Particularly, it is essential that no new obstacles are put in the path of the economic progress of the developing countries, which are already at the receiving end of the imbalances and inequities of the present international economic order and of the abuse and misuse of the international environment. 
Respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and independence is not only just? it is also good politics and essential to the attainment and maintenance of world peace. The General Assembly clearly recognized that fact when it adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples way back in December 1960. Yet today, nearly three decades later, colonialism is still very much in evidence. Again, that is a practical reality of our times. The right of peoples to decide their own destiny is being denied not only in the well-publicized cases of southern Africa and the Middle East, especially Palestine, but also in countries in the Pacific, the Caribbean basin and elsewhere. 
However, the major issue facing the Organization this year is the decolonization of Namibia. That is as it should be. The birth of a new nation is a supreme event in international affairs. And when the United Nations is the appointed intermediary the event becomes even more special to all of us. We ate now entering the horns stretch in the implementation of the Namibian independence plan. Much ground has already been covered and much reference has been made to this phenomenon in speeches we have heard in the last two weeks. But a lot more still remains to be done in the remaining four-and-a-half weeks. Pretoria and its functionaries in Namibia are still refusing fully to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the South West Africa Territory (SWATP) command structure has not been disbanded, end we are told that it has only been stood down  the so-called disbandment of Koevoet on 30 September has proved to be illusory  restrictive laws, in particular AG-23, continue to inhibit freedom of assembly and the registration, electoral and constituent Assembly proclamations leave much to be desired. These proclamations were affected only last week, end more information is still being given as to what exactly has been agreed to. Some improvements have been made, some changes have been recorded, and we commend the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) for this, but we need to be vigilant and to ensure that in the next four-and-a-half weeks nothing will be done to reverse the clock. Intimidation of followers of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) by the South-African-sponsored Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) end the South West African Police is regularly reported. In fact, if members read Namibian newspapers they will find they ate full of reports of attacks on SWAPO men and supporters, at times with the police just standing by. UNTAG police units are stretched to the breaking-point we are told, and the assassination of SWAPO leaders has actually taken place.
So, while we ate on the home stretch, a grave situation still surrounds events in Namibia, and it is important that we should all keep our guard and remain vigilant. As we enter these final weeks of the election campaign the desperation of the anti-SWAPO forces in Namibia is becoming evident daily. It is important, therefore, that urgent action be taken to strengthen UNTAG police units and to increase the number of projected electoral monitors. We are very pleased that a number of States represented here have agreed and are going to send observers, monitors and guests to Namibia over the next few weeks to observe what will be happening. The more observers, the more guests, the more people we can have in that country, the better. We welcome the effort being made by many States around the globe.
Meanwhile, the United Nations must prepare well-thought-out plans for the post-election period in Namibia, assuming the election proceeds satisfactorily. For there can be no doubt that, as the decolonizing authority, the United Nations has a continuing responsibility to see that Namibia's independence is a success. A good mother does not give birth only to abandon the baby immediately. This session of the General Assembly must ensure that the United Nations prepares itself to be a good mother. My delegation is ready to contribute in the process of clarifying the united Nations role during the transition period following the elections and in the elaboration of a continuing United Nations responsibility to ensure that Namibian independence is a success. These are urgent tasks which require our immediate attention. Every effort has been made to draw the attention of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the United Nations generally to these natters, especially the question of convening the Assembly after the elections. Whoever wins the election, it is not yet clear how the Assembly will be convened and how it will proceed to draw up the constitution leading to independence. We would be pleased if the United Nations would remain seized of these problems and would continue to provide solutions until the time of independence itself.
In South Africa itself, apartheid, the root cause of all the problems in southern Africa, continues to be firmly entrenched. The state of emergency still continues  Mandela and other political prisoners remain incarcerated j liberation and mass democratic movements ant still proscribedÂ·, the Group Areas Pet and other obnoxious legislative acts continue to be on the apartheid statute books. That is the reality of the situation in South Africa itself.
President de Klerk's talk of reform so far remains only mere talk. It is important that the Pretoria regime be urged to go beyond rhetoric to concrete action. The liberation movements are ready to engage President de Klerk in serious negotiations. They have formulated an imaginative negotiating platform which was adopted by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, in Harare, on 21 August 1989, as well as by the ninth non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade, It is on the table for South Africa to take advantage of. This is an olive branch from the liberation movement. It outlines a number of confidence-building measures needed before negotiations can begin and sets out the fundamental human rights that should guide the formulation of a new constitutional dispensation for a future South Africa. It is quite obvious of course that negotiations, or any form of dialogue, cannot take place while the leaders are incarcerated in gaols or while the present restrictions emanating from the state of emergency remain. The international community has warmly welcomed this important initiative for peace to which I have just referred, taken by the liberation movement. So far Pretoria has remained mum on this proposal. We are told that certain of the seven leaders who are now incarcerated nay be released sooner or later. That might be a palliative, but what we need is a complete and full constitutional dispensation that can being peaceful conditions in which negotiations can truly take place for the future of an independent South Africa.
Until Pretoria dismantles apartheid it is important that the international community intensifies its pressure on it and increases the sanctions against it. There is no secret about the fact that Pretoria is now talking reform is directly related to the impact of international sanctions and the pressure exerted by the liberation forces and other democratic forces in South Africa. There is no doubt whatsoever that sanctions are working and can continue to work. They have damaged the South African economy to a great extent, as has been admitted by the economic spokesmen for that regime. Therefore, more sanctions will certainly put more pressure on the regime. The medicine is slowly taking effect. We appeal to those friends of Pretoria who oppose sanctions to join the rest of the international community in bringing meaningful pressure to bear on Pretoria by applying sanctions and supporting the liberation movement.
To the international banking community we say that 1990 will be a critical year for the apartheid regime, because in that year it has to reschedule its debt. Rescheduling the debt is not an automatic right for the racist regime let it be a favour, granted as an inducement to meaningful change in South Africa. The concatenation of events makes the coming rescheduling exercise a particularly potent force for positive political developments in South Africa. We urge the bankers to use it. We have given them adequate information to ensure that they ace quite clear about the choices before then.  
Elsewhere in southern Africa, there are regional efforts to bring peace to Angola and to Mozambique. The Assembly has heard statements by the Foreign Ministers of both those countries, elaborating on those measures. We in Zimbabwe appeal to outsiders to stop supporting rebel elements in Mozambique and Angola, especially UNITA in Angola, which has created difficulties in the process of reconciliation. We are seeking African solutions to African problems. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations can help as requested and as required, but we ask them to give these initiatives a chance.
We also seek peace efforts in the dispute between Mauritania and Senegal, the situation in the Sudan and the situation in Ethiopia. African solutions, initiated by the OAU, are at work in those situations, and we again appeal to outsiders not to interfere in the processes of reconciliation that ate taking place. We are satisfied that the initiatives taken by the Organization of African Unity, if given time to mature, will provide solutions and bring peace to the three areas I have mentioned.
We are also anxious to see Western Sahara's independence consolidated with speed and firmness. The Secretary-General's efforts to bring permanent peace to Western Sahara are commended. We also commend the meetings that took place earlier this year between the King of Morocco and the POLISARID Front. We hope these efforts will continue.
The denial of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination is a continuing sore in international relations. We deplore the heavy-handed methods of the occupation forces against the aggrieved heroic Palestinian nation. We wish to reiterate our conviction that only an international peace conference under United Nations auspices, with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as an equal partner are addressing all aspects of the Middle East crisis, can bring peace to the region. The proclamation of a Palestinian State last year was an important development in this area. We commended, and commend, the PIO for the step it took, and we are pleased that over 85 countries have recognized the Palestinian State. From that strong position, the Palestinian leadership should be able to proceed to meaningful negotiations with big Powers, small Powers and others in the region that are seized of the problem of Palestine. The independence of Palestine has been long delayed, and we should like to see the Palestinian people take their place as equal citizens alongside the peoples of other nations.
In Central America, we welcome the decision to disband the contras and the scheduled elections in Nicaragua, which are to be monitored by the Organization of American States, the United Nations and a host of other international observers. We are pleased that a dialogue has resumed between the Salvadorian Government and the Marti National Liberation Front aimed at bringing peace to El Salvador. We urge flexibility on both sides so that a peaceful solution can be found to their conflict. The only warning we as outsiders would issue regarding the Central American situation again takes the form of urging outsiders not to interfere in the processes that are taking place there. The effort being made by the leaders of Central America to corns together and produce plans that enable them to enjoy self-determination and full human rights and provide peace for their own territories is commendable - if only outsiders do not interfere. In that respect, the main instigator of problems that have arisen in Central America is, of course, the United States, which has continued to fail in troubled waters in Latin America. 
In Afghanistan, we again urge all outside Powers to stop supplying arms to the opposing sides, and we call upon the Afghan people to negotiate an end to their civil war in a spirit of national reconciliation. We are pleased to note the departure of Soviet troops, and we are also pleased to note the confidence and patriotism that act brought to the Afghan people themselves. We hope that sooner or later they will convene a shura - an assembly - that will make it possible for all Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan to get together to resolve their problems. We believe all Afghans can solve their problems in peace in a shura, their traditional assembly which had met periodically over the past 300 or 400 years.
On the question of Kampuchea, we welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and urge the parties concerned to negotiate their differences among themselves in order to arrive at an acceptable solution. We noted with disappointment the failure of the recent Paris Conference. We also noted with disappointment that both the Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh delegations to that Conference refused to accept the international mechanism that was suggested a United Nations peace-keeping force. We have made it clear to them, and we make it clear now, that we do not see any possibility of disarming the rival forces, bringing peace to Cambodia and holding elections there without the active participation of the United Nations. The United Nations has much experience with peace-keeping forces around the world, and, in our view, is the only organization that can assist in the peace-making and peace-keeping process. 
With regard to the Korean peninsula, it is our view that the Korean people should be left alone to negotiate their reunification without outside interference. We urge that the military manoeuvres by outside forces that often take place on the peninsula or in waters near it be stopped.
With regard to Cyprus we appeal again to both parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the search for a lasting solution. We commend the meetings that have taken place under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General between the President of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish Cypriots. Again, we call on outside Powers to cease interfering in the internal affairs of Cyprus.
In Belgrade the leaders of the non-aligned countries called for self-determination for the remaining colonies of New Caledonia, Malvinas, Diego Garcia, Mayotte and a dozen other territories scattered across the globe. The forty-third session of the General Assembly declared an International Decade for the eradication of the retrograde system of colonialism. We repeat that call from this rostrum.
As can be seen from the problems I have just touched upon, we have not yet readied the Promised Land, the new detente notwithstanding. Much remains to be done, and in that the United Nations must play a central role. We therefore welcome the declarations that have be Ï made from this podium by the great Powers, renewing their faith in the United Nations. These days of change also mean a period of uncertainty, a period of opportunities, yet also of danger. In such a period, recourse to and respect for the Organization and its agencies becomes more indispensable than ever before.
It was in recognition of that fact, and motivated by the desire to strengthen peace and the rule of law, as well as to bring the age of reason to international relations, that the non-aligned countries convened at The Hague, from 26 to 30 June 1989 a Conference on Pace and the Rule of law in International Affairs. We were pleased by the wide attendance at that Conference, which included important countries not members of our Movement. The Conference was a landmark in the struggle to bring the rule of law and the role of the World Court to the centrality they should enjoy in the resolution of conflicts and in the management of international relations. An important initiative was taken at the Conference to have the General Assembly declare at its current session a decade of international law from 1990 to 1999, leading to a third Hague Peace Conference. That is one of the concrete acts that can be achieved at this session of the General Assembly in the cause of peace, justice and the rule of law. We urge all Member States to support that noble initiative by the non-aligned countries. I am informed that a concrete proposal has already been submitted to the Sixth Committee and that it is now being debated.
Last - but by no means least - is the all-important issue of nuclear disarmament, to which I have not referred extensively in my statement. We have all had the opportunity to welcome the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in 1987. That was a truly significant step in the right direction, but what remains to be achieved is even more formidable. In comparison to that, the INF Treaty is indeed only the tip of the iceberg. The super-Powers have a special responsibility in this regard. As the possessors of the largest arsenals of nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction, they have a duty to take the lead in the disarmament process.
But of course we of the non-aligned movement, as well as the Organization of African Unity, can take some credit for the fact that at the special session of the General Assembly convened last year to discuss the question of disarmament we made our position abundantly clear. We indicated the hazards of war with which the road to disarmament is replete, and we are pleased that our call has been heeded in some quarters.
Today the world still has many problems, but in 1989 there is a window of opportunity to address some of them. History will judge us harshly if we miss that opportunity.
","The direction of the world economy is still determined by a small circle of rich and powerful nations for which short-term expediency and the requirements of individual national economies have all too often taken precedence over the steps required for a healthier world economy from which all States would benefit in the long run. For the smaller countries the result has been a collapse in commodity prices causing severe prejudicial terms of trade, where several times the volume and quality of produce is now required to purchase the same amount of manufactured goods from the North than was required only a few years ago. In addition, the necessary borrowing on the part of the developing countries, coupled with high interest rates, has resulted in a debilitating debt-service burden for those countries that has culminated in a net reverse transfer of resources from South to North in the order of nearly $50 billion annually according to the calculations of international financial institutions. It outlines a number of confidence-building measures needed before negotiations can begin and sets out the fundamental human rights that should guide the formulation of a new constitutional dispensation for a future South Africa. From that strong position, the Palestinian leadership should be able to proceed to meaningful negotiations with big Powers, small Powers and others in the region that are seized of the problem of Palestine."
44,1989,PHL,"ï»¿Before you began to occupy that exalted seat, Mr. President, you were already discharging a noble international mandate, having presided for years over the Special Committee against Apartheid. Under your direction, the global counterattack against that insult to the race of man has gained signal victories. And now, there you are, Mr. President, a friend of the Filipinos, who visited us in 1987, a friend of our late martyr, Ninoy Aquino, having worked with him at Harvard. We Filipinos rejoice that it is you who will preside over this body of nations for the next 365 days.
And to Mr. Dante Caputo, the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, let me say how much our prediction of success for his presidency last year has been proved correct. His expert hand steered us through the proceedings without conflict, without incident, without delay. We had faith in him as an outstanding human leader, and he justified that faith.
Filipinos can take added pride in the fact that Dante Caputo, our successful outgoing President, is a man who, like us, has his roots in the world of Hispanic culture.
Last year, I came to this rostrum to bring the Assembly a message from the poor of my country. I said that they are poor not because they come from an indolent race. For, I said, our countrymen now cover the earths 2 million of us in the Americas, half a million in the Middle East, a quarter of a million in Europe, half a million in Asia and the Pacific - seekers all of toil and life, teachers of nations, physicians of men, builders of industry, designers of modules that challenge the stars and settle on the moon, men and women of skill and diligence, like those of Europe who settled America and here built a new world. I said they are poor not because they do not know how to fight for their rights. For they were the first in Asia to shed their blood against Western colonialism and produce their own republic. Ninety years later, they were the first nation in the world to mass by the millions to confront guns with rosaries and bring down a dictator without the shedding of blood. In those four bloodless, spectacular days of February they raised, under Corazon C. Aquino, the new peaceful rallying cry of people power, which even now is resonating, sometimes unsuccessfully, always gloriously, in the streets of nations in transition on more than one continent of this earth.
I said they are poor not because they multiply too fast. And they know that in rich nations it is the building of cities and industries, not the extermination of human instincts, that has reduced this multiplication.
I said they are poor not because their nation does not grow. For our country does grow. Now that we are free again, although we remain harassed by the extremes of right and left, we have kept to our democratic course and our economy is growing again: last year by 6.8 per cent, last semester by 5.3 per cent.
They are poor, I said, because they have inherited an external debt from the dictator - now $30 billion - and in order to service it their country must divert about 20 per cent of its annual budget and send out annually $1.7 billion more than it receives. All these years the countries of the North have insisted that one may not talk of debt relief beyond the boardrooms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Yet international debt forgiveness became a reality just about the time the IMF and the World Bank were born, for both these institutions were conceived by the same bold, victorious, visionary leadership that, remembering the stubborn mistake in 1919 at Versailles, forgave in 1947, in London, 70 per cent of the German debt. And so I called last year for the formation of an international debt and development commission in order to recapture that original vision. The Group of 77 responded quickly, and two resolutions were drafted. The first called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue using his high offices towards a common understanding on a solution to the international external debt. That resolution was passed by the forty-third session of the General Assembly with only one member voting against, and one abstaining.
This year the second resolution, submitted as a draft decision by Tunisia on behalf of the Group of 77 - the one calling for the establishment of the commission on debt and development that I had the privilege of proposing last year - is on the agenda of this Assembly. The draft decision calls upon this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly
'To establish, under the aegis of the Secretary-General, an Advisory Commission on Debt and Development composed of eminent persons from the academic, political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance, trade and development, to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt problem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development.' (A/C.R/43/L.19) . The draft decision provides that
'Debtor and creditor interests shall be represented in the membership of the Commission, which shall take into account the need for appropriate geographical representation and regional balance.! (ibid.) . It commands that 'The Commission shall take into consideration the various existing studies and recommendations on the subject, including the views of the Secretary-General set out in his report entitled 'Towards a durable solution of the debt problem and those expressed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the Trade and Development Report, 1988.' (ibid.). Finally, it gives this Commission a life of three years and commands it to submit annual reports to the General Assembly. A commission of this kind was proposed by the non-aligned summit in Belgrade early this month.
The Assembly must adopt this draft decision, for the global attack on debt must be pressed. The Assembly must adopt it because you yourself, Mr. President, have articulated the economic, political and social consequences of the international debt. The Assembly must adopt it, for the time is come when original rigidities are yielding to flexibilities. In 1987 Japan suggested IMF-funded bonds to buy out debtors' loans. At the 1988 Toronto summit France proposed the forgiveness of debts of the poorest of the poor in the sub-Sahara. At the forty-third session of the General Assembly last year, French President Francois Mitterand proposed an IMF-guaranteed conversion of loans into bonds to reduce financial charges of debtor countries and urged creditor countries to finance this scheme. Last year, as we were delivering our opening statements in this Hall, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States - at the annual IMF-World Bank meeting in Berlin - was standing firm against the use of international aid funds for private-debt reduction.
A week later, as I negotiated in Washington a review of the Philippine-United States military bases agreement, the same Secretary of the Treasury began to show flexibility. He agreed to the Philippine position that a portion of United States compensation money could be used for a debt-re duct ion component of the bases compensation package.
It was for us - and perhaps for all international debtors - a historic breakthrough, a budding promise of universal relief. Four months later the bud blossomed into a full-fledged plan. On 10 March 1989 United States Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady announced that plan, which allows - nay, encourages - the financing of international debt reduction and debt service by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Because of the plan, our Philippine negotiators may soon sign with private banks a debt-relief agreement that could be unprecedented. It will be voluntary, for the extent of debt relief is determined by the willingness of commercial banks to agree to substantial discounts on debts repaid. It will be a substantial debt reduction, possibly up to half of the debt to banks which choose to exit from our borrowing programme. And there will be new resources - up to $1 billion from the hard core of institutions that will continue to support us.
I spoke to the Assembly last year of our poor. They are still poor, and they are still there, but they may now look hopefully to new horizons. Flexible minds make new horizons possible. It is the flexible and creative mind of Secretary Brady, bending with the international reality, that has given us this new horizon. It is, indeed, thank God, the new age of flexibility. I saw it happening in the Soviet Union, too, last month, when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow, where flexibility is pronounced perestroika and glasnost, and includes the ability to change, to admit past imperfections and to dream of new perfections.
Let us aid this new flexibility, let us speed its momentum by providing it with global underpinnings, underpinnings which can emanate only from the peaceful processes of the United Nations and the instruments that awaken its talent to create. One such instrument could be the proposed Advisory Commission on Debt and Development. The Commission will come to life, not as a challenge to the creditor nations, but, indeed, as a tribute to them and as a move of collaboration by debtor nations in that new openness which creditors have begun to display.
The Brady plan sees forgiveness as essential to revitalizing adjustment and making us credit-worthy again. The Brady plan can jump-start the stalled engines of development of debtor nations. The Brady plan is a beginning, and it must answer still other questions. Is there no criterion, for instance, with which to judge the application of debt-reduction or relief, except that they should be pursued? Must we wait until all the physical levels of production and productivity potentials are obliterated for the debt to be written off or forgiven?  Are not meaningful reductions possible only when there are new facilities that are not caught up in the inertia of the international bureaucracy or of strongly held philosophies and interests? Otherwise, will the focus ever go beyond sub-Sahara?
Should not the Government major actors of the plan be mobilizing their leverage and adjusting their financial regulations? Is it enough to lay out the bare bones, which lose their flavour in the broth of rhetoric?
Should not the Commission be advising not only on how to persuade creditors to reduce debt but also on how to help debtors produce in order to pay debt?
There is, for instance, the generation of power - power produces goods? goods pay debts. The Commission could stimulate power-generation and raise the power capabilities of debtor countries. It could ask the question*, if rich countries have often been ready to underwrite slum clearances, cannot they launch a programme to underwrite power equipment on concessional terms for the development of a slum-cleared economy that in time will develop the capacity to repay these concessional loans? Let the world take note that the most outstanding success of the United Nations is the United Nations itself.
The United Nations cap is full of feathers these days. There is a feather for putting Namibia irreversibly on the road to independence and to becoming the 160th Member of the United Nations. There is another feather for the Secretary-General's mediating a cease-fire and bringing fighting between Iran and Iraq to an end. There is a special feather: the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize for the United Nations peace-keeping forces.
There are still other feathers perhaps soon to be pinned on that cap - for United Nations campaigns on drug abuse, on the environment and on terrorism. Can there be United Nations campaigns any more urgent than those against these universally recognized evils - drug abuse, abuse of the environment, terrorism? I submit that there can.
There is a conventional theological faith that every human being is born with original sin. There is a new theology, a theology of bondage, not liberation.
Today a human being is born not only with original sin but also with original debt. To quantify it, the third world now owes 41.3 trillion to creditors, so every child in that world is indebted up to 41,000 at the moment of birth. At an
annual rate of interest of 10 per cent compounded, these human beings at the age of 21 will each owe $7,000, and if they marry at that age, husband and wife will begin their married life with a joint burden of over 314,000. Is not that a challenge worthy of 15 9 Members of the United Nations to take up?
Is not this campaign worthy of being launched now, now that the momentum of flexibility has stirred the ranks of the lenders?
Is not this the moment for the debtors to extend the hand of collaboration to the creditors, in a Commission, as the draft decision puts it, 'of eminent persons from the academic, political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance, trade and development, to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt problem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development'? (A/C.2/43/L.19, para, (a))
Let the Commission be the next feather in the United Nations cap. It will be a timely and elegant feather. A world of hungry debtors awaits its pinning in the United Nations cap. 
","They are poor, I said, because they have inherited an external debt from the dictator - now $30 billion - and in order to service it their country must divert about 20 per cent of its annual budget and send out annually $1.7 billion more than it receives. Yet international debt forgiveness became a reality just about the time the IMF and the World Bank were born, for both these institutions were conceived by the same bold, victorious, visionary leadership that, remembering the stubborn mistake in 1919 at Versailles, forgave in 1947, in London, 70 per cent of the German debt. Let us aid this new flexibility, let us speed its momentum by providing it with global underpinnings, underpinnings which can emanate only from the peaceful processes of the United Nations and the instruments that awaken its talent to create. It could ask the question*, if rich countries have often been ready to underwrite slum clearances, cannot they launch a programme to underwrite power equipment on concessional terms for the development of a slum-cleared economy that in time will develop the capacity to repay these concessional loans? Is not this the moment for the debtors to extend the hand of collaboration to the creditors, in a Commission, as the draft decision puts it, 'of eminent persons from the academic, political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance, trade and development, to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt problem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development'?"
44,1989,SDN,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Garba of Nigeria most warmly on his election as President of the General Assembly. Nigeria is a country
with which the Sudan enjoys warm, close and friendly relations. We are sure that he will guide the work of the Assembly in a successful manner and with fruitful results.
I also express the deep gratitude of my delegation to his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the great ability with which he carried out his stewardship of the forty-third session.
We would also like to renew our thanks and gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for the invaluable efforts which he has exerted in order to strengthen international peace and security.
The Assembly is, I am sure, well aware of the latest political developments in Sudan. These developments aim at rectifying the situation in our country on the bases accepted by our people. These are: the principles of good-neighbourliness; the peaceful settlement of disputes; the promotion of mutual co-operation at regional and international levels; the deepening of the principles of non-alignment; respect for international instruments; and the peaceful solution of problems that confront our country. In this connection it must be noted that current initiatives and efforts aimed at solving the problems of the Horn of Africa by peaceful means receive the full support of my Government. We hope that these initiatives will bring about stability and complementary security in the region within the framework of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region.
The guest for peace in the Sudan has been and still is one of the main priorities of my Government. Peace, in our view, should be achieved through direct negotiations and dialogue. These have already commenced and we hope they will be pursued until lasting peace, national unity and stability prevail in our country. The Sudan is still faced with enormously complex economic and social problems. The Assembly at its forty-third session dealt with some aspects of these problems in adopting a resolution on emergency economic assistance to Sudan following the rains and flood disasters. The Assembly also adopted a resolution on special assistance for the problem of displaced persons. And in the past year the international community accorded priority to the largest humanitarian relief operation in the region when the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched Operation Life-line in the Sudan to save thousands of people in the southern regions from starvation and death.
While Sudan is grateful to the Secretary-General and the international community for providing this highly appreciated assistance in our ordeal, we look forward to continued efforts by the international community to implement the resolutions adopted by the Assembly at its forty-third session which called for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the infrastructure destroyed during the rains and flood disasters. This is in accordance with the commitments that were undertaken last November. International assistance should also be extended to the displaced southern Sudanese in the Eastern and Western Sudan when primary factors of production are available, so as to enable them to be self-sufficient. It is also our view that assistance in the medical and health fields should be continued.
In talking about the great success scored by Operation Life-Line Sudan, particularly in protecting the citizens in that part of the homeland from a devastating famine during this autumn, we should not forget the strenuous efforts exerted and the pioneering role assumed by Mr. James P. Grant, Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), who led the operation in his capacity as the Secretary-General's Special Representative, and 'his colleagues. Indeed, Operation Life-Line Sudan would not have succeeded had it not been for the positive response and support that Sudan received from donor States and various voluntary organizations, in particular from the United States of America, the European Economic Community and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
My Government fully understands the human dimension of Operation Life-Line Sudan and is firmly committed to the need for the continuation of the international effort to realize the objectives spelled oat in the Khartoum Plan of Action. It is for this reason that my delegation will submit, at the current session of this Assembly, a draft resolution calling on the international community to demonstrate its solidarity win and support for Operation Life-Line Sudan in its upcoming phase devoted to rehabilitation projects.
The last few years have witnessed a renewed interest in peaceful accommodation by the two super-Powers and the relaxation of tension in international relations. The intention of the various parties to resolve conflict in international relations through peaceful negotiations has been confirmed. This favourable international climate enabled the United Nations to play its predictable role with efficacy and considerable success. The United Nations has made valuable and constructive contributions in this regard. Vet more is expected from the United Nations by way of the realization and strengthening of international peace and security.
These new beginnings have evolved to create an international climate that is favourable to stability and requires increased mobilization for its consolidation. Sudan therefore welcomes the progress achieved in the area of disarmament and the concrete proposals made to reduce armaments. Sudan also welcomes the constructive proposals recently announced by the two super-Powers on chemical and medium-range weapons.
The beginning of this month witnessed the convening of the Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Countries during which the Heads of State and Government adopted important decisions aimed at consolidating peace and boosting the prosperity of mankind. In welcoming all these efforts we hope they will evolve into concrete achievements that will realize the basic aspiration of the international community to avert the dangers of armament and war. This new rapprochement and political, cultural and economic co-operation between countries and groups with different political systems will give impetus to the consolidation of international peace and security - all the more so when it becomes evident that the mutual interests that bind people and countries are stronger than the political and ideological differences or disputes over narrow interests. These positive trends are ushering in a new era for mankind and we trust that all will duly contribute to it.
Since the General Assembly met last year in its historic session at Geneva and the international community's recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State on its own soil, the Palestinian people, under the leadership of its sole, legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and by the Group of Arab States has demonstrated its acceptance of the international community's decisions as all the United Nations resolutions with a view to paving the way to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.
For its part, Israel continues to challenge the international community and flout United Nations resolutions. This makes Israel the main party responsible for the deterioration of the situation and the escalation of the conflict. As a result of this obdurate Israeli attitude, the Palestinian problem, unlike other problems in other tension areas, has not shown any progress towards a just and comprehensive settlement that preserves the rights of all parties.
What Israel purports to present as an election plan is no more than a plan to consecrate its occupation that daily escalates its bloody and oppressive practices against the Palestinian people. Elections are based on the idea of free will, but what free will is there for a people denied the right to self-determination?
The intifadah of the Palestinian people in occupied Palestine is the glowing culmination of a long, valiant and courageous struggle. The will of the Palestinian people will not be sapped by Israeli occupation. The intifadah proves that the denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people will lead only to deadlock. The international community has no option but to strive in an effective way to force Israel to comply with its rule and implement United Nations resolutions regarding Palestine and Israel's withdrawal from Palestinian land and all occupied Arab territories.
My country continues to follow with grave concern the bloody events to which the sisterly people of Lebanon are subjected. However, the recent success of the Arab Tripartite Committee to convene the Lebanese House of Representatives and the meeting of the Security Committee give us cause for optimism regarding prospects of an agreement that will bring about peace and security in Lebanon.
The present situation in southern Africa is of grave concern to us. The Brazzaville Protocol and the New York Agreements of last year sparked hopes for a full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. But the Pretoria regime is manipulating the implementation of the independence plan and persistently violates its text and spirit in an attempt to weaken the political position of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and ensure its own future hegemony over, and colonial rule of, Namibia even after completion of the plan.
South Africa has not dismantled neither Koevoet nor the South West Africa Territorial Force, which are still actively terrorizing the people of Namibia by every means. Those terrorist strike forces are a real and very serious threat to the security and safety of the leaders and members of SWAPO and to their legitimate political activity.
Some of the repressive and discriminatory laws are still in force, for instance the AG-8. Some political prisoners are still behind bars and amnesty is restricted to Namibians in exile and does not include Namibians inside their country, which leaves them exposed to threat and terror by the State.
With the elections in sight next November, South Africa is already manipulating the process to rig the elections. The Voters Registration Act, exclusively set up by the Pretoria regime, allowed the moving of thousands of white South Africans into Namibia and registering them there for the elections. South African military and police staff and civil servants of the colonial rule stationed in Namibia can also register and vote. South Africa's Administrator General has introduced two pieces of legislation that are a flagrant and grave violation of the principles of free and fair elections. The draft on elections does not provide for the secret vote and has loopholes that allow rigging in vote counting.
The draft on the Constituent Assembly effectively denies the people of Namibia its right to self-determination as it installs the Administrator General as president of the Assembly with veto power.
The international community is now required, more than ever before, to monitor closely the independence plan for Namibia. We call on the Security Council to fully assume its responsibilities as stated in its resolutions 435 (1978) and 640 (1989). Enough funds and facilities must be made available to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) to enable it to fulfil its assigned duties. The massive popular reception that SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma received at home this week proves beyond doubt the full support of the people of Namibia for SWAPO. This support will certainly be reflected in the results of the forthcoming elections, if the international community guarantees that they are truly free and fair.
The situation in South Africa remains the same, despite political changes there. Apartheid is still in place. The Pretoria Government is still most aggressively repressing the resistance of the people of South Africa to this notorious system and refusing to heed the universal demand of the international community that it release the militant leader Nelson Mandela and his comrades. Condemnation is not enough. Nominal support of the struggle of the people of South Africa is not enough. The international community is required to confront the racist regime and strictly implement its boycott in order to completely isolate it and enable the people of South Africa, under the leadership of its legitimate representatives, the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAQ , to gain its legitimate rights.
The international community has witnessed with great appreciation the efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General which have resulted in the establishment of a cease-fire in the long, bitter and destructive war between Iraq and Iran. Although this achievement created hopes and optimism, we observe with concern the lack of progress in the negotiations between the two parties to the conflict. We call upon the two countries to confirm their peaceful intentions and respond positively to the efforts of the international community represented by the United Nations, and to work constructively to resolve the complications of the war and settle the conflict comprehensively and conclusively by peaceful means within the framework, and through full implementation, of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). This settlement, we believe, is an essential precondition for repairing the ravages of war and mobilizing both countries' potential for reconstruction and the national welfare.
The Geneva accords reached in 1987 between the parties to the Afghan question and the subsequent withdrawal of Soviet troops from that country raised hopes that national reconciliation in Afghanistan was imminent, but it has not materialized so far. We call upon all the Afghan parties concerned to contribute constructively to reaching national reconciliation and unity without which neither security, stability nor reconstruction can be achieved. We carefully observe the recent developments in Cambodia and call upon all parties to work sincerely to achieve the goals that will realize the aspirations of the people of Cambodia for independence, sovereignty and national unity. We hope to see the Korean people move towards achieving their aspiration to reunify their homeland through peaceful means, free from foreign interference.
We hope that the initiatives for reconciliation and the elimination of tension in Central and South America will lead to general and comprehensive security and peace and thus contribute to the stability and development of the region. This prompts us to speak of the dangers to which Colombia is exposed because of its war against the mafias of illicit traffic in drugs. We hope the international community will support the Government of Colombia in its attempt to root out drug trafficking, which is a threat to security and stability in the region.
The international scene has witnessed rapprochement between the two super-Powers, and peace has been achieved in many places in the world, but this is not reflected in the fields of international economic co-operation. We hope that the monies released by arms reduction will be put into programmes of economic and social development in the developing countries within the framework of international economic co-operation.
The priority in this direction is to set up a just international economic and monetary system that will help these countries to overcome backwardness, poverty and stagnation. This cannot be done unless the international community fully assumes its responsibilities and seriously exercises political determination in addressing problems of growth and development in the developing countries. Foreign debt is the primary obstacle to any effort to promote economic growth. The Sudan recognizes the encouraging initiatives of some creditor countries and dreams that efforts in this sphere are not enough; they must be supplemented by effective steps to accelerate financial flows into the developing countries to support their national developmental efforts and expand their economic capacity. These steps are necessary to enable those countries to embark on the course of repaying their debts and to activate broader, more comprehensive co-operation to the benefit of both debtors and creditors.
The conception of economic and technical co-operation has become an integral part of the general political awareness in the developing countries. The changing scene of the international economy offers opportunities for co-operation that must be utilized through a forthright dialogue between the rich and the poor countries to the benefit of both. Efforts must be made to control the net flow of resources from the developing countries to the developed countries and the multilateral financial institutions, thus depriving the developing countries of vitally needed resources. The progressive drop in the international prices of primary commodities is of grave concern to the developing countries, and we hope that the establishment, last June, of the Common Fund for Commodities will contribute to improving the present state of trade in primary commodities. We welcome the global system of trade preferences and consider it a necessity to strengthen its mechanism in favour of the developing countries, particularly considering the current trend of protectionism.
Having passed through the 'lost eighties', the developing countries view with hope and optimism the nineties, the fourth decade of the International Development Strategy, when the lessons of the past will indeed help in setting new concepts of international economic solidarity. We look forward to the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, especially in developing countries, and to the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Paris. We consider them important steps towards establishing the solidarity of rich and poor countries for development, elimination of poverty and consolidation of the basis for self-reliance.
We should like to draw attention to the dangerous situation resulting from environmental deterioration, particularly desertification, drought, ecological imbalance, climatic changes and the depletion of the ozone layer. We also draw attention to the dangers of exporting nuclear and industrial waste and dumping them in the developing countries. We call upon the whole international community to bear jointly the common responsibility to control environmental deterioration and share its burden, while noting the necessity of achieving sustained and ecologically safe development. The many important and urgent matters on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly and the favourable international climate offer a great opportunity for the international community to confirm its sincere commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. This will promote the efficiency of the Organization and is a guarantee of the establishment of international peace and security and the enhancement of international co-operation in all other fields.
Finally, we hope that this session will achieve fruitful results which will make it a landmark in the annals of our collective effort.
","It is for this reason that my delegation will submit, at the current session of this Assembly, a draft resolution calling on the international community to demonstrate its solidarity win and support for Operation Life-Line Sudan in its upcoming phase devoted to rehabilitation projects.

44,1989,RUS,"ï»¿My task as head of the delegation of the Soviet Union to the General Assembly has been greatly facilitated by two fundamental statements made by Mikhail S. Gorbachev concerning the place and role of the United Nations in building new international relations at this crucial stage of world development for mankind, at time when it is moving out of the cold war into a period of peace in its development and affirming a new political order resting on a comprehensive approach to security.
The profound analytical report of Mr. Perez de Cuellar on the work of our Organization over the past year has impressed us with its convincing evidence of the expansion of the role of the United Nations as a global peace-maker. Addressing the Assembly, its new President, the representative of Nigeria, Mr. Garba, also referred to that.
The heads of many delegations have put forward some far-reaching and original ideas at this session. Yesterday we listened with close attention to the statement of President George Bush of the United States, which, in our view, contained a number of very important and interesting ideas.
As always, during these days of the General Assembly's regular session representatives of the world community have together been recreating a panorama of the past year in the life of mankind. Its overriding idea is that of peace and security, its ideal composition is harmony of universal human values and national interests.
In making our own national contribution to this grand agreement each of us, I am
sure, wants it to become a part of an organic and unitary whole. Unfortunately, in some places the overall composition is still marred by cracks that impair its integrity. Over the past 12 months we have seen a rather contradictory picture of the state of the world.
Of course, the central concept remains the same and the theme, a product of mankind's thought and suffering, as we were appropriately reminded by the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, has not changed: it is the piloting of our common ark towards a new shore and our common desire to chart its course so as to avoid a storm that might destroy it. Nevertheless, there have been some new developments which have aroused concern. It is not just that the ship of the world has not yet negotiated the dangerous straits; it is encountering new threats that could give it a critical lurch.
The twentieth century has released the tremendous energy of nations and peoples, and this has become a major factor in the development of universal civilization. It is capable of and has been working miracles by extricating entire national communities from backwardness and poverty in what is historically an amazingly brief span of time. It is adding to the mosaic of the world more and
more bright and clear-cut elements of progress and prosperity. However, the same national energy, when it takes the form of inflated egotism and self-interest, often makes for aggression and expansion, a grasping for one's own good at the expense of others.
Here the problem of the self-defence of nations arises, the problem of their Physical survival, preserving their unique historical and cultural identities. Action provokes counteraction, which assumes some highly ambivalent forms. Centrifugal tendencies are prevailing over centripetal ones, thus upsetting the balance of world relationships, which is so hard to build.
This diverts the focus of our attention from traditional international issues to domestic and inter-ethnic conflicts. It has now become quite clear that internal strife in some countries extends the process of their destabilization to vast areas and that regional upheavals convulse the whole world. Lebanon is a case in point. It is often much easier to resolve the external issues in a settlement than to deal with its internal conditions, and this is clearly evident in Afghanistan and Cambodia.
Today the notion of 'inside the country' often has a bearing on that of 'outside'. The trouble, however, is that the isolated fragments of the world which yearn for a better life fail to see beyond the mountain ridges, jungles, dunes and other features of their own national landscapes, the threat to their own existence, that might objectively result from such a fragmented view. Equally, those who want to prosper at the expense of others do not see that their own existence is also threatened.
This leads us to the question of the responsibility of the part vis-Ã -vis the whole and of nations vis-Ã -vis mankind. This places on our agenda the problem of harmonizing universal and national interests.
Some clarifications and explanations are in order here.
The supremacy of universal human values and observance of universal rules of the world community are the imperatives of our time. The objective requirements of the age we live in, its trends, character and circumstances leave mankind no other choice but to reject the traditional polarization. This is the axiom which underlies both the concept and the practical policies of the new thinking. Of course, it cannot resolve the existing contradictions overnight, but as a start it can alleviate them.
On the question of the primacy of universal human values, we are also implying the mature readiness of nations to accept this. Where that maturity has not yet been attained, and where the national idea is being juxtaposed with the common interest, domestic conflicts directly complement and impel global destructive processes.
Now I should like to stress this: freedom of choice continues to crown the hierarchy of a nation's supreme values. Every nation is free to choose the ways and means of its own development, but to do so in a responsible manner. It must not lock itself in the dark rooms of national selfishness or ignore the interests of other peoples and of the entire community of nations. Freedom does not mean irresponsibility towards others, for in the final analysis that would mean irresponsibility towards oneself.
The time has finally come to realize that not all means are good for attaining even the most noble ends.
The international community has become aware of the danger of narcotics traffic, of terrorism, it condemns and outlaws both phenomena. We need equally determined action against any kind of violence, whatever the motives or excuses for it. Violence by the State against its own people must be totally excluded. Violence on national, ethnic or religious grounds can no longer be tolerated.
To repeat, we advocate freedom of choice. However, we reject its interpretation as the licence to use any means, to commit any violence or to shed blood. Freedom must not be sought at the expense of others. No support or sympathy should be extended to so-called movements that countenance actions'
humiliating to other nations or use terrorist, barbaric and inhuman methods in waging their struggle. It is to be deplored that. 50 years after the Second World War. some politicians have begun to forget its lessons. Let us remember that political and ideological differences did not prevent Comments and nations from joining forces to defend universal human values from nazism and fascism. The dividing line in that battle was drawn not by ideology but by the rules of and attitudes towards morality. The Soviet Union, the United States. Great Britain and other countries and peoples found themselves in the same camp and. fighting side by side, saved civilization.
Fascism, which started the war is the extreme and ugliest form of nationalism and chauvinism. German nazism marched under the banner of revanchism. Now that the forces of revanchism are again becoming active and are seeking to revise and destroy the post-war realities in Europe, it is our duty to warn those who, wittingly or unwittingly, are encouraging those forces. The revanchist movement is dangerous and inimical to the march of peace, to which President Bush referred here yesterday.
While expressing respect for healthy national movements, let me refer to one modern concept of nationhood. it defines a nation as a collective personality, endowed with certain rights, in many respects similar to and even sometimes identical with individual human rights. But there are no rights without responsibilities, either for the individual or for the State.
It is the mission of the United Nations to promote among the world's peoples the idea of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common good of mankind, and to encourage nations to behave responsibly. This fundamental position of the Soviet Union is clearly reflected in our bilateral contacts. Relations between the Soviet Union and the United states Provide the best illustration of this. I will permit myself to touch upon the  United States-Soviet dialogue only because I am convinced that its importance far transcends the frontiers of the two States.  In the view of the Soviet leadership, this is not a kind of privilege but a clearly understood responsibility towards the world community. Therefore my account of the results of our talks with President Bush and Secretary of State Baker is my report to you.
These talks demonstrated increasing awareness by both sides of the need to co-operate for the benefit of mankind and growing confidence that such co-operation, such interaction, is possible.
Agreement to hold a meeting of the top leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States shows that we have moved far ahead in solving a number of major bilateral and international problems. Extraordinary efforts at the highest level will be needed to attain the goal of concluding treaties.
I am referring in particular to the preparation of the agreement on 50 per cent reductions in strategic offensive arms. We have proposed to the United States side options for resolving the key issues in that agreed: the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-ballistic Missile Systems, space, and long-range sea-launched cruise missiles. Our partners have accommodated us on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. Positions on other outstanding problems have come closer to each other. In our view, by the time the summit meeting is held next year, in late spring or early summer, we may have passed the last turn on the road towards a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms. This is a real prospect. The protocols to the 1974 and 1976 Treaties on nuclear explosions could also be signed at the summit meeting so that they could enter into force very soon thereafter. We are confident that the summit meeting will give a powerful impetus to the talks on major reductions in the armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe.
We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President Bush. Generally consistent with the initiatives of the Soviet leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to rid mankind of these barbaric weapons. The Soviet Union is ready, together with the United States, to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention: cease the production of chemical weapons, as we have already done - I am referring here also to binary weapons, on a bilateral basis, radically reduce or completely destroy Soviet and United States chemical weapons, regarding this as a step towards the global destruction of chemical weapons: renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, institute rigorous verification of the cessation of the production and the elimination of chemical warfare agents. I think there is no need to say how beneficial all this would be for the overall world climate.
In addition to the problems of security, the Soviet-United States agenda encompasses issues of humanitarian cooperation, regional topics and joint efforts in the fields of the environment and economic development, reflecting the process that brings together national and universal concerns. We are more aware today than ever before that Soviet-United States relations cannot be built outside the global context, divorced from the problems concern to all mankind.
Our discussions in Washington and Wyoming have moved us ahead in our efforts to bridge the continuing gap between the attitudes to one's own good and the attitudes to the common good. Much remains to be done, however, to alleviate the disparities of political objectives, for such disparities endanger all of us.
Let us examine the situation, taking nuclear weapons as an example. Why are they dangerous? Not only because of their sheer destructive power. They are unacceptable because they widen the chasm between national and universal interests. The equality of nations and the unity of the world become empty talk when someone's national selfishness is driven by the idea of nuclear supremacy over the world, camouflaged as national security interests.
I would say that the world community has as yet no reason for complacency or euphoria. The nuclear threat has only been reduced by the Soviet-United States Treaty eliminating intermediate and shorter-range missiles.
We believe that reliance on nuclear weapons does not serve anyone's national interests. It is also an obstacle in the way of more democratic international relations. Only the complete elimination of nuclear capabilities would help to attain real security.

The advocates of nuclear deterrence do not believe this will be possible in the foreseeable future. They respond with concepts of so-called minimum nuclear deterrence. In our view, that is a step forward, if only a timid one, a step that can be taken. But first we must define what we mean by minimum nuclear deterrence and what capabilities should be considered sufficient.
The Soviet Union proposes that those questions be discussed at a meeting of representatives of the nuclear Powers and the States on whose territories nuclear weapons are placed. Of course, the persistence of the concepts of nuclear deterrence is due not only to the undue emphasis placed on national rights and interests at the expense of obligations, but also to the lack of trust. The problem should not be easily dismissed. What is the way out of these vicious circles? It lies in affirming glasnost and openness and in building a wide-ranging infrastructure of pervasive verification. If we do need to deter each other, let deterrence be transparent and verifiable.
To that end, the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear Powers conclude multilateral agreements on measures to reduce the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war. Detailed discussions to work out such an agreement could be held in consultations among the permanent members of the Security Council.
In the same context, we wish to raise once again the problem of the cessation and prohibition of nuclear tests. This is the question of questions. Why are we still unable to put an end to such tests despite the express will of the overwhelming majority of nations? Because there are those who want to maintain their superiority at any cost.
Guided by its obligations to the world community, the Soviet Union has revised its nuclear-testing programme by reducing the number and yield of explosions.
Let me point out, however, that the efforts of one State are not sufficient for a comprehensive solution to this problem. We see a number of possibilities here. First of all, the USSR is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions on any day and at any hour if the United States reciprocates. Secondly, it is time finally to end the procedural impasse at the Conference on Disarmament and start concrete discussions there on the problem of a complete test ban. Thirdly, as one possible way of achieving such a ban, we are now considering the possibility of extending the 1963 Treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions. There is an urgent need for a verifiable cessation of the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes. We have declared that this year we are ceasing the production of enriched uranium, that in 1987 we closed down one reactor producing weapons-grade plutonium, and that we plan to close down in 1989 and 1990 a few more such reactors. By the year 2000 all remaining reactors will have been shut down.
In addition, the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear Powers should begin preparing to conclude an agreement on the cessation and prohibition of the Production of such material. We believe that in the verification of compliance with the agreement the vast experience of applying International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards could prove useful.
It would seem that even the way the Second World War began ought to have made clear that weapons do not guarantee security - the more weapons there are, the greater the danger of aggression. And yet for the 45 post-war years security has been sought in the arms race. It is only today that we are beginning to understand the need for a fundamentally different concept of security in Europe, a security that relies increasingly on political means and, only as insurance, on the necessary minimum of armaments.
The Vienna accord heralded a new European situation, opening up broad vistas for humanitarian cooperation and exchanges of people, ideas and information. It holds out the prospect that the European idea will rest itself on a foundation of trust and openness. But the groundwork has to be prepared for that by clearing the continent of excessive quantities of arms. That work has begun.
When the negotiators do not consign their responsibilities to the back rooms, when they sincerely want to strike a balance between their interests and those of their partners, progress is always achieved. One example is the Vienna talks between the Warsaw Treaty countries and the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on reducing armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe.
In response to our alliance's initiative the NATO countries have made some meaningful proposals, which go a long way towards accommodating the positions of the Warsaw Treaty countries. In parallel talks between the countries participating in the European process to develop a qualitatively new generation of confidence- and security-building measures the Warsaw Treaty member countries have proposed a far-reaching approach calling for a comprehensive set of such measures, and extending them to air force and naval activities.
Reverting to the topic of the obligations of individual countries to the community, I feel it my duty to emphasize that reluctance to engage in active talks on reducing naval forces is a sign of neglect of those obligations. Leaving naval forces outside the process of reducing armed forces and armaments would be harmful to universal security. The problem of naval forces could be examined, for example, in special consultations to be attended by all States concerned and, above all, by major naval Powers. They would discuss mutual concerns in this sphere and would exchange views on the mechanism and ultimate objective of future negotiations and on how to move towards them step by step.
The dialectic of developments on the European continent urgently requires the starting of talks on tactical nuclear weapons. The situation does not appear to be deadlocked. Mutually acceptable solutions could be sought in an in-depth discussion of this whole range of issues between the USSR, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the States where those weapons have been placed. If NATO countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear weapons the USSR will respond with further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.
The problem of missile proliferation is also ripe for multilateral discussions. Nearly 20 countries possess such weapons, and the trend towards further geographical spread is still strong.
The approach to this issue could be two-pronged. Barriers could be erected which, first, would preclude the proliferation of combat missiles and associated technology across the globe, and, secondly, would not impinge on the legitimate interest of countries in gaining peaceful access to outer space.
No one in the world can yet bid farewell to arms, but we can abandon, once and for all - and we can do it now - the practice of unconstrained and uncontrolled international weapons transfers, lb that end the principles of glasnost and openness should be asserted here as well. The USSR reaffirms its willingness to participate in the establishment of a United Nations register of weapons sales and transfers, including work on parameters.
The time has come when the idea of preventing war is finding material expression in relations between the armed forces of a number of countries. A new peace-making instrument is being shaped by the Soviet-United States agreement on preventing dangerous military activities and by a series of agreements with the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany and France on the prevention of incidents on the high seas. Along the same lines. Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have agreed to start talks short!, on putting an end to their military standoff. The  Soviet union expresses the hope that other states too will engage in this process.
A civilised world is an open world. Breaking the seals on many secrets, the soviet union has revealed to the international community detailed data about all reductions in its armed forces and armaments, their strength, the size of its military budget, and so on.
We reaffirm here the position of the Soviet Union. Our ultimate goal is to have not a single Soviet soldier outside the country. But, speaking of equal responsibilities, let us roundly condemn the continuing encirclement of our country - and not only our country - by military bases of other states.
The soviet union attaches fundamental importance to a transition from individual measures of confidence-building, openness and glasnost in international affairs to a global policy of openness, which would become an integral part of comprehensive security and international peace. The President of the united States, Mr. Bush, has proposed the idea of open skies. We like that idea. In welcoming and supporting the initiative, the Soviet Union calls for the opening up and open space, only then shall  e attain absolute transparency and the necessary level of confidence.
While we duly include in the records of foreign policy such accomplishments as the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan, the process of granting independence to Namibia, the termination of hostilities on the Iran-Iraq front, and the constructive dynamics in the dialogue on the problem of Cambodia, we cannot yet say that the positive trends are irreversible.
Let us pay a grateful tribute to this Organization for its peace-keeping operations. Let us recognize its unique role, which goes beyond simply localizing conflicts and achieves a qualitatively new level in ensuring stability in the world order. But today's world order is of a far broader category. We have firmly established economic security as one of its pillars.
The Soviet Union shares the entirely justified concern about, and it supports, measures to overcome the crisis in the world economy - measures that were proposed at the Belgrade summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. There are a few who continue to dictate to the many the terms of their economic existence. The devotees of diktat should understand that perpetuation of the current situation is fraught with the danger of a catastrophe that would spare no one - and that is no exaggeration.
It would seem that the world of the rich has nothing to worry about since its economy is in good shape. It would seem also that the rich are beyond reproach since, ostensibly, their wealth breeds generosity. In 1988 the aggregate amount of the developed nations' assistance to the developing countries amounted to 3US 90 billion - an impressive sum indeed - but in the same year the developed nations received from the developed world $US 50 billion more in debt servicing and interest payments. That was the largest flow of capital in history from the poor to the rich man's pocket.
Thus the prosperity of the rich is achieved not without help from the poor. There is more to it, however, than this obvious injustice. Such disparities cannot for ever keep testing the strength of the world economy and world politics.
The health of the world economy is also being undermined by the enormous cost of military production, which siphons off vast material and intellectual resources from the civilian sector. Now that there is a prospect of limiting the military-industrial complexes, the problem of conversion has to be addressed. This can be done only by working together and relying on the experience of all States.
Before the very eyes of just one generation the sphere of politics has linked
up with environmental conservation to give mankind the science of political ecology. No one can master it alone, enchained in the fetter of narrow national interests.  
Political ecology requires urgent planetary decisions at the highest political level and the thorough internationalisation of national efforts through the United Nations, through consolidation of its leading environmental branch, the appropriate agency of this Organization. And, since we are speaking of a major component of international security. I would add that political ecology requires the involvement of the Security Council in solving problems and activating such tools as transparency and strict international monitoring.
The United Nations conference on environment and development, to be held in 1992, will undoubtedly be a watershed in establishing universal cooperation and working out a code of civilized ecological behaviour. We call for the holding of this conference at the level of Heads of State or Government.
Defining for itself the main principles of the concept of ecological security, the Soviet Union considers disarmament, the economy and ecology as an integral whole. While participating in implementing conservation strategies, the Soviet Union has programmes for speeding up the integration of its economy, on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, into the world economy, the modern international division of labour and international exchanges in science and technology. that
end we should like to participate actively in the work of international economic organizations and to establish contacts with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, being convinced that our co-operation with them, as well as with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations will be useful both for us and for the community as a whole.
In the building of new international relations, our foreign policy looks ahead to a positive evolution of today's world and to its stability. That orientation remains unchanged, even in the face of certain changes which affect our immediate interests and the interests of the community to which we have the honour to belong. But we remain faithful to our avowed principles and continue to affirm that nations' choices cannot and must not be overridden by force and that stability cannot be achieved by threatening the use of force or by intervention, blockade or other sanctions.
It is no secret that we were not enthusiastic about the Polish Communists' election set-back, nor should it be a secret that we hope they can overcome the crisis. Nevertheless, we see nothing threatening in the fact that a coalition Government has been formed, in accordance with the will of the Polish people, We are in no way prejudiced against that Government. We wish it every success and are ready to co-operate with it most actively.
Tolerance is the norm of civilized political behaviour. But if it is mandatory for us in our attitude towards the current Government of Poland, why are others so intolerant as regards, say, Cuba? And if a non-Communist Prime Minister is possible in a Socialist country, why should the appearance of a Communist as head of a Western Government be perceived as heresy? That is something we should not exclude either. The days of traditional demarcation lines are numbered. Only one line remains, to be pursued by all of us together moving to a common goal.
It is not the expression of popular will that threatens countries, but, rather, political and ideological intolerance, chauvinism and extremist excesses of imperial or nationalist mentalities. It is only when they engender violence and destabilize the life of countries and peoples that the machinery of legitimate defence must be activated.
However different may be our ideas of preferable ways of social development, we also have an overriding understanding of our common responsibility for the future of mankind and the survival of civilisation. We know that only together can we step beck from the brink, because an isolated island of development and prosperity would inevitably sink in the ocean of backwardness and poverty peoples and nations cannot be well when mankind is sick. 
There is only one way out of those fateful correlations. As we see it, it is for the world community to move consciously towards harmony between universal and national principles. It is difficult to attain, but it is possible because the collapse of the world is unthinkable. It is possible because we  all share a place where individual national efforts unite in a single 'energy field'.
The United Nations is that Place, it offers a forum for everybody to talk about his own country and its links with the rest of the world. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about my country.
We are building a new model of society, a new model of relations between Peoples and nations, a new model of socialism. As a great concept, socialism is by no means a spent force, indeed, it is revealing its humanistic potential in the bitter and often dramatic confrontation with the forces and flaws that are organically alien to it We in our country are not just repainting the facade, but are rebuilding the entire structure, in which the rules of living together must and will be based on the supremacy of law, people's power, openness to the outside world, inter-ethnic harmony and friendship.
In every sphere of the common life of our State and our people - the national economy, the political system and the people's intellectual endeavour - rejection of the ossified relics of the past goes hand in hand with the enthusiasm of new construction. Even though, in the words of a poet, we may have a gloomy day or two, we are confident that perestroika, which began as a revolution of hopes, will keep those hopes alive. Our people, our nation, will keep perestroika going, for it embodies the aspirations that they cherish.
Today, when some Cassandras hasten to make gloomy predictions, we make our own forecast. We want this historical optimism to be shared by all those who understand that the destiny of the world is inseparable from the future of our Perestroika. So we say to them: our determination to make it irreversible is matched by our belief in victory, a confidence grounded in the democratic institutions, which are ready to assert their genuine and full authority.
We are moving along that path guided by, not least, our awareness of the historic nature and magnitude of our goal, which we must attain ourselves, while not rejecting the support of the world community.
Believe me, we feel that support not only during the tragic days of natural disasters and national misfortunes. I say to representatives: it has been voiced in your statements at this Assembly, it manifests itself every day in your compatriots' generous gestures, their deeds and actions. So I ask you, the envoys of your Governments and nations, to convey to them our warm gratitude.
 
","In our view, by the time the summit meeting is held next year, in late spring or early summer, we may have passed the last turn on the road towards a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms.

44,1989,CHN,"ï»¿
Permit me to begin by warmly congratulating you. Sir on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly: I am sure that this session will be a success. I also wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the President of the last session, Mr. Dante Caputo. For his outstanding contribution in fulfilling his high mission.
The past year has been marked by fresh achievements in the efforts of various countries to seek solutions to regional conflicts, reduce the threat of war and improve the international situation, and by new prospects for world peace. However, ours is not a trouble-free world. regional conflicts have not yet come to a halt. The arms race is still going on. Certain international contradictions have sharpened, owing to violation of the established norms of international law. The economic situation in the developing countries is further deteriorating. All this demonstrates that the source of world turbulence and tension still exists. The Chinese delegation would like to expound its position on the major questions confronting the world today. 
The first question is regional conflicts. regional conflicts affect peace and tranquillity in the world and have caused direct, tremendous losses, particularly to many third-world countries. As a third-world country and a permanent member of the Security Council, China is naturally very much concerned about the issue of regional conflicts. The Chinese Government has all along stood for a fair and reasonable political settlement of those conflicts, and has played a constructive role in this regard.
In accordance with the Geneva Agreements on the settlement of the Afghan question, the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan. That is a positive development. Genuine peace, however, has yet to come to the land of Afghanistan. We hope that the various political forces there will set up a broadly based coalition Government through consultation and achieve peace in that land so that the Afghan people may rebuild its country.
Iran and Iraq reached a cease-fire a year ago on the basis of mutual acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and each is now busy rebuilding its war-ravaged economy. We hope that these two developing countries, with which China enjoys friendly relations, will soon resume contacts and negotiations so as to turn their cease-fire into a lasting peace.
The recent summit conference of the five Central American States has been well received by the international community, as it produced important new agreements on promoting the peace process in Central America. It is our hope that the United States also will respect the peace efforts of these countries. The smooth implementation of the agreements will benefit the stability and development of the region.
Over the past year positive changes have occurred on the scene of southern Africa. With the start of the process of Namibian independence, the ultimate accomplishment of the historic mission of decolonisation on the African continent is now in sight. Angola has made headway in trying to bring peace to the country. The Government of Mozambique is working hard to end the unrest in its country. The Chinese Government has always sympathized with and supported the Namibian people in their struggle for independence. We hope that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and other relevant agreements will be seriously implemented and that the South African authorities will honour their commitment, so as to ensure the holding of a free and fair general election under effective United Nations supervision and to bring about Namibian independence as scheduled. We call on the international community to be watchful, to work to eliminate obstacles to the Namibian independence process and guard against any incident that may arise to the detriment of a free and fair general election.
The Chinese Government has always supported the African countries in their just struggle against racism, and the efforts made by the front-line States and people in southern Africa to achieve peace and stability in the region and develop the national economy. We hope that their efforts will enjoy broad sympathy and vigorous support from the international community. The black people in South Africa are entitled to racial equality and democratic rights. We strongly demand that the South African authorities abrogate the universally condemned apartheid system, which is contrary to the spirit of our times.
Since the last session of the General Assembly there has been an ever-stronger call for a political settlement of the Middle East question. The just struggle of the Palestinians living in the West Rank and the Gaza Strip has clearly demonstrated that the question of ending the Israeli occupation and solving the Palestinian issue with no further delay. The Palestine Liberation organization has adopted a series of flexible and practical policies, winning wide appreciation and support from the international community. It is high time the Israeli Government went along with the trend of history by replacing its rigid position by a flexible approach.
The Chinese Government stands for a settlement of the Middle East question through political means without resorting to force. We support the convocation of the International Conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices with the participation of the parties concerned, including the five permanent members of the Security Council. We appreciate the efforts of the parties concerned in the Middle East question to conduct dialogues of such diverse forms as they deem appropriate. We demand that Israel stop forthwith its suppression of Palestinian residents in occupation zones and that it withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. We hope to see mutual recognition between the State of Palestine and Israel, guaranteed security both for Arab States and for Israel, and the peaceful coexistence of the Arab nation and the Jewish nation. That, in our opinion, is the correct way to lead a Middle East long plagued by turmoil to peace and tranquillity.
Together with the other justice-upholding countries concerned, the Chinese Government has over the past 11 years consistently worked for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Cambodian question. To that end the United Nations has adopted 10 successive resolutions. The Cambodian question arose as a result of the Vietnamese invasion. Therefore, a comprehensive settlement of the question calls for an end to the Vietnamese invasion and the removal of its consequences. That is the very essence of the successive resolutions adopted by the United Nations on the Cambodian situation, and it is also the consistent position of the Chinese Government. during the transitional period from the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces to the holding of a general election in Cambodia, the only way to ensure peace and forestall a dangerous situation in the country is to set up a provisional coalition Government headed by Prince Sihanouk and composed of the four parties in Cambodia. Cambodia should be restored to its independent, neutral and non-aligned status, while the countries concerned should provide an international guarantee for that status. Recently, the International Conference on Cambodia was held in Paris; it was attended by foreign ministers of many countries and leaders of the four parties in Cambodia. This in itself is of major significance, but regrettably, the Conference did not produce the anticipated results, owing to the rigid position taken by Viet Nam and Phnom Penh on the proposal put forward by the majority of the States participating in the Conference for an international control mechanism under United Nations auspices, the establishment of a provisional quadripartite coalition Government headed by Prince Sihanouk, and a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian question. As for the withdrawal of forces from Cambodia promised by Viet Nam, without the necessary international supervision people have reason to doubt whether Viet Nam has genuinely pulled out all its forces and military personnel of other categories. We hope that the international community will continue to follow the situation in Cambodia closely, render sympathy and support to the Cambodian people in their just cause, and keep working for a fair and reasonable ultimate settlement of the Cambodian question so as to remove completely this regional hot spot.
The second question is disarmament.
The past year has witnessed new progress in the field of international disarmament. The Treaty between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is being implemented. Positive results emerged from the International Conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons held in Paris last January. With the start last March in Vienna of. the negotiation on conventional armed forces in Europe and the subsequent specific proposals put forward by each side, long-deadlocked European conventional disarmament has taken a turn for the better. Moreover, the Soviet Union and some East European countries have decided to carry out a unilateral reduction in their forces and armament or withdraw some of them from abroad.
Nevertheless, it is noted that the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union has not come to a stop. They continue to vie with each other in developing high-technology weapons systems and in going all out to upgrade their nuclear weapons and have even extended their arms race into outer space. So the halting of the arms race and the achievement of effective disarmament remains an arduous task.
The international community expects the United States and the Soviet Union to shoulder their special responsibility for disarmament by taking the lead in drastically reducing their nuclear arsenals and conventional armaments and by stopping their arms race in all forms, including that in outer space. It is our consistent view that chemical weapons should be completely banned and thoroughly destroyed. At the present session of the General Assembly, the United States and the Soviet Union have made proposals on the question of chemical weapons. We hope that they will take practical steps to stop production and development of those weapons and destroy their existing stockpiles, so as to facilitate the conclusion of an international convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.
Disarmament is a question bearing on world peace and the security of all countries. Therefore, all countries, big or small, strong or weak, nuclear or non-nuclear, should have an equal say in the question, and each can play an active role. The reasonable demands and propositions of the many small and medium-sized countries ought to be respected, and full play should be given to the role of the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on disarmament issues. All this is highly necessary for the healthy development of the international disarmament process.
The third question is the proper handling of State-to-State relations.
Over the past year a number of countries have improved their relations with each other to varying degrees, which is a valuable contribution to world peace. What is particularly encouraging is that the Arab States have closed their ranks, in a spirit of conciliation. Countries in Africa are working for increased peaceful co-operation on that continent, while Latin American countries have made further headway in their regional co-operation.
China has all along devoted its efforts to the establishment and development of friendly relations and co-operation with other countries on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The past year saw even better and stronger relations between China and many other countries, especially its neighbours.
China maintains a traditional friendship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We are interested in peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's reasonable proposition on the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, and wish to see positive results flow from the dialogue and contacts between the North and South of Korea. We have always enjoyed good relations with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and many other neighbours in South and South-East Asia. We have normalized our relations with the People's Republic of Mongolia and Laos. Our relations with India are improving in many fields. The consultations on normalization of Sino-Indonesian relations are proceeding smoothly. The solidarity and co-operation between China and Arab States, African States and Latin American States have also made new progress.
In May this year, China and the Soviet Union held a top-level meeting, thereby normalizing their bilateral relations. In a spirit of bidding farewell to the past and opening up the future, leaders of the two countries reviewed and summed up the history of Sino-Soviet relations and agreed to develop the bilateral relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. good-neighbourliness between the two big countries, China and the Soviet Union, is in the interests of not only their two peoples but also peace and stability in Asia and the world at large. This has been well received by the international community as it benefits the whole of mankind.
China's relations with Western countries were on a course of steady development. However, difficulties of varying degrees have emerged over the past few months in our relations with certain Western countries. What has exactly happened? Has China acted contrary to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in its relations with these Western countries? No. Has China encroached upon their interests in any way? No. It is known to all that in late spring and early summer this year turmoil occurred in China's capital Beijing, which was aimed at subverting the Government of the People's Republic of China and overthrowing the socialist system stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic. It goes without saying that how to deal with this problem is China's internal affair. The whole world witnessed the fact that for almost two months the Chinese Government had exercised the utmost restraint and tried to solve the problem by persuasion and education rather than compulsory measures. It was not until the critical moment when the events had turned into an anti-government rebellion that the Chinese Government was compelled to take decisive measures to quell the rebellion. The overwhelming majority of countries in the world have expressed their understanding of this action by our Government. Only certain Western Governments, ignoring the facts and basing themselves on nothing but distorted news reports and misinformation, levelled unwarranted charges against the Chinese Government and applied pressure on it. It should also be noted that there is much evidence pointing to involvement in the above-mentioned events by some hostile foreign forces, which added fuel to the flames. They know full well what role they have played. In order to maintain State sovereignty and national dignity, it is only natural that the Chinese Government should have firmly rejected their meddling in the events in China and interference in its internal affairs, which contravene the norms governing international relations and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. In their statements at the General Assembly in the past few days, the delegates of some countries continued to attack the Chinese Government groundlessly. To harp on 'democracy' and 'freedom' while indulging in the habit of making arbitrary criticisms and imposing one's own will on others in State-to-State relations represents precisely the kind of behaviour that goes against the historical tide. This is indeed regrettable.
The day after tomorrow, the People's Republic of China will celebrate its fortieth anniversary. For China, 1 October 1949 is a day of great historic significance, marking the end of an era in which the Chinese people were subjected to every kind of national humiliation. Over the past four decades, foreign pressure on New China has never ceased, but what has come of it? New China is ever forging ahead. It has never feared, and will in no way bend to any foreign pressure. China's affairs can only be decided by the Chinese people, and China's policy can only be determined by the Chinese Government. Through long years of practice, we have found a development path suited to China's conditions, and we will continue along that path. We have formulated an independent foreign policy of peace attuned to the fundamental interests of the people of China and the world, and we will keep pursuing that policy. China will adhere to its policy of reform and opening to the outside world and continue to work for development of relations with other countries throughout the world.
A normal relationship between China and a foreign country serves mutual interests, whereas in case of a disruption of such a relationship, China will by no means be the only one to suffer. Past experience has repeatedly proved that normal State-to-State relations can only be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China abides by these principles, and if other countries also do so, normal relations can certainly be established and developed between them. Herein lies the way out of the current difficulties in the relations of some Western countries with China.
The fourth question is the establishment of a new international political order.
Now that the world has advanced to a stage where most former colonies and dependencies have won independence, all States should treat one another as equals and an end should be put to hegemonic practice. Yet, facts show that hegemonic practice and power politics still exist. From time to time, there are cases in international relations, such as the big bullying the small, the strong domineering over the weak, the imposition of one's own will on others, or even armed encroachment upon the sovereignty of another State and damage to its territorial integrity by force. Should these acts which contravene the norms governing international relations remain unchecked, there can be no tranquillity in the world or guarantee of peace.
With the concerted efforts of the international community, the world now witnesses a trend towards relaxation of tension and increased contacts among nations. This is a good thing. But meanwhile, in international contacts, there are still obvious attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by various means in violation of the basic norms governing international relations. It is dangerous for State policies to be formulated and pursued with such attempts in mind, as it will detract from relaxation of international tension and lead to the continuation of the cold war. This is a question which merits the attention of the international community.
On the one hand, there are vast numbers of countries in the world with quite different social systems, ideologies, values, historical backgrounds, cultural traditions and religious beliefs, and on the other hand, their interests predetermine the need for contacts with one another. Consequently, all countries are required to adopt a realistic attitude by recognising the diversity of the world, refraining from interfering in each other's internal affairs, and observing in their contacts the mutually accepted norms governing international relations. We firmly believe that such a world will be in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of all countries. I wish to use the forum of the United Nations to present this idea of the Chinese Government, hoping that statesmen of various countries will give it serious consideration when exploring the future of the world.
The fifth question is the establishment of a new international economic order.
For a long time developing countries have suffered greatly from inequitable exchanges, owing to irrationality in existing international economic relations. For them the recent years have seen worsening terms of trade, plummeting export earnings, dwindling production investment and heavy debt burdens. There has been even the phenomenon of reverse capital flow from poor to rich countries for many years running. So the tendency of poor countries to become poorer and rich countries richer is more pronounced than it was a decade ago. If allowed to continue, this situation will bring in its wake even more serious consequences for the whole world, including both the developing and the developed countries. The economic development of the third world has become a pressing issue affecting the global scene. Current international economic relations should not and cannot remain completely unchanged in the time to coma. The establishment of a new international economic order is the need of the times.
In our view, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should also be abided by in the conduct of economic relations between countries. A country's economic problems can be solved only by the government and people of that country with policies appropriate to their national conditions. Economic contacts between countries should serve friendly co-operation between them and not be turned into means of exerting pressure on other countries or interfering in their internal affairs. Any attempt to impose a certain economic system or developmental model on other countries and to interfere in the economic policies or development efforts of developing countries means power politics in the economic sphere, it runs counter to norms of international relations and the current historical trend and will not work in practice.
To promote the establishment of the new international economic order in the interest of common development of all countries, what is urgently needed at present is a new round of truly substantive North-South dialogue with emphasis on solving the pressing problems facing the developing countries, such as debt, trade, capital and finance. We call on the developed countries to respond constructively to the proposals for reviving the North-South dialogue made by the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries held in Belgrade in Sept either this year and the Special Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 held last June in Caracas. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to growth and development, scheduled for April next year, will arrive at a fresh common understanding on future international economic co-operation and will provide a sound guideline for it. We also hope that the new international development strategy being worked out will offer effective measures in this regard.
Protecting the environment has become a pressing issue of universal concern? it must be given full attention while efforts are made to solve the question of development. China has made the protection of the environment its State policy, we attach importance to and will participate in the United Nations conference on environment and development scheduled for 1992, and are ready to make necessary preparations for its convocation with other countries and relevant international organizations. We note with pleasure that, as the most influential international organization, the United Nations has in recent years had some outstanding achievements in facilitating the political settlement of regional conflicts, maintaining world peace, and promoting international co-operation and economic and social development. As a result, there is universal recognition of the importance of the United Nations. The positive efforts made by the Secretary-General have also won extensive acclaim from the international community.
The final decade of the twentieth century is approaching. A new century is setting in, the times are progressing and the face of the world is changing. Like the entire international community, the United Nations is faced with unprecedented opportunities and extraordinary challenges. In order to adapt better to an ever-changing world, the United Nations needs to continue its own reform and further improve its efficiency. World peace and development need the United Nations, while the success of the United Nations depends on the support and co-operation of all its Member States. Together with the many other United Nations Member States, China is ready to fulfil the duties prescribed in the United Nations Charter and to contribute its share to a strengthened role of the organization in world affairs.
","during the transitional period from the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces to the holding of a general election in Cambodia, the only way to ensure peace and forestall a dangerous situation in the country is to set up a provisional coalition Government headed by Prince Sihanouk and composed of the four parties in Cambodia. The international community expects the United States and the Soviet Union to shoulder their special responsibility for disarmament by taking the lead in drastically reducing their nuclear arsenals and conventional armaments and by stopping their arms race in all forms, including that in outer space. On the one hand, there are vast numbers of countries in the world with quite different social systems, ideologies, values, historical backgrounds, cultural traditions and religious beliefs, and on the other hand, their interests predetermine the need for contacts with one another. Consequently, all countries are required to adopt a realistic attitude by recognising the diversity of the world, refraining from interfering in each other's internal affairs, and observing in their contacts the mutually accepted norms governing international relations. We note with pleasure that, as the most influential international organization, the United Nations has in recent years had some outstanding achievements in facilitating the political settlement of regional conflicts, maintaining world peace, and promoting international co-operation and economic and social development."
44,1989,ESP,"ï»¿I should like to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Joseph Garba on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at this session. His qualifications and outstanding activity in this Organization are of fundamental value for the success of our work. I also wish to express my thanks for the excellent work done by his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, and to reiterate our full support and deep gratitude to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for his untiring work at the head of the Secretariat.
Since the founding of the United Nations, we have probably never witnessed as we do today so many efforts to improve the international climate or so many changes in the framework that has governed international relations for the past 40 years. Ideological intransigence, confrontation as a means of diplomacy and indifference to the overwhelming economic, social and political problems of a significant part of mankind have started to give way in the face of mankind's growing aspirations to broaden the scope of coexistence, to lay the foundations of true peace and to consolidate the notion that the individual is the direct and primary beneficiary of all government action. Although, unfortunately, many bloody conflicts persist in various parts of the globe, in recent times the use of force as an instrument in international relations has been shown to be futile. International co-operation, in which multilateralism must, in our opinion, be a key factor, has now to a large extent reduced the level of confrontation and the number of situations that could lead to war. Owing to the globalisation of current problems, we must also judiciously consider other dimensions which are equally essential to peace, and in which this increasingly vital international co-operation has not progressed as much as we would have liked. I refer, for example, to issues such as the differences between rich and poor countries, economic development, man's relationship with nature and the progressive deterioration of the environment, and phenomena such as terrorism and drug trafficking - to which I shall refer later in my statement.
First, with regard to the changes in Europe, the new climate in East-West relations - which has been observed in this Assembly - is encouraging. This is true not only with regard to the reduction of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the military alliances and their members, but also in relation to domestic changes in many countries, with progress in democratisation and respect for human rights. In this context, I wish to highlight the processes under way in Poland and Hungary and in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, not all Eastern European countries are following these desirable paths.
The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) , with all its dimensions, has played a fundamental role in this whole process of European detente between countries and within countries. Moreover, it has been imbued with fresh vigour with the adoption of the Final Document of the Vienna meeting.
We welcome the significant role played by the United Nations in the present international context. Recognition by its Member States of the undeniable value of multilateralism has considerably broadened the Organization's scope for manoeuvre and has enabled its efforts to be more fruitful. The growing political realism of many countries which in the past were reluctant to accept solutions that were not extreme; the progress towards more pragmatism in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries; the resolute action of the Security Council reinforced by the new co-operation among its permanent members; and the intelligent work of the Secretary-General are basic elements of that stimulating process.
Nevertheless, we are still a long way from an international society in which violence, poverty and the violation of fundamental human rights are absent. The United Nations can do and has done much to bring us closer to that objective, but its action cannot be successful if, at the same time, those engaged in these conflicts do not have the clear political will to terminate them.
Security Council resolution 598 (1987), adopted over two years ago, laid the foundations for negotiating a solution to the bloody war between Iran and Iraq. It is true that since then the guns have been silenced, but peace in the region is fragile and little progress has been made towards a just and lasting solution reached through the full implementation of resolution 598 (1987). Therefore the process of negotiation now under way under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative must be intensified, and I assure them once again of the full backing of my Government for their delicate mission.
In Afghanistan, the signing in April last year of the Geneva Agreements opened the way to a solution. This year the final withdrawal of Soviet troops has been completed, making a peaceful settlement of the problem possible. Efforts must nevertheless be intensified to achieve a lasting settlement based on the Afghan people's exercise of the right to self-determination without outside interference. In order to achieve that goal, a broadly based Government representing all the parties to the conflict must be formed and any refugees wishing to do so must be allowed to return. The continued efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve that peaceful settlement should be supported, and the General Assembly should renew his mandate.
The evolution of the situation in southern Africa over the past year has shown hopeful signs on some fronts. Unfortunately, the intolerable system of apartheid persists in South Africa. We trust that the recent political changes in South Africa will lead to a more realistic and intelligent attitude when the time comes to undertake the necessary process leading to a truly democratic, pluralistic and non-racist society in that country. Once more we demand the lifting of the state of emergency, the legalization of all political parties and groups that oppose apartheid, and the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners.
The historic process that started in Namibia last April has our unconditional support. We are confident that the process of independence will be completed within the agreed schedule and we reiterate our full confidence in and support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative regarding their mission in Namibia. Spain is participating by means of a large contingent in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. I should like to place on record here our determination to provide financial backing for the new country.
We welcomed with great satisfaction the Gbadolite agreements complementing those which, towards the end of last year, made it possible to start the gradual withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. We trust that there will be a total cessation of hostilities, which will lead that country to national reconciliation. free of foreign forces. At the same time, we support the contacts established in Mozambique with a view to ending the violence. We call for the immediate cessation of all outside attempts to destabilize that country. We also express our hope that the processes begun in Namibia and Angola will have a positive influence in Mozambique and the southern region as a whole, particularly in the front-line States.
The withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia constitutes a positive but insufficient step. We regret the suspension of the Paris Conference, where greater flexibility from the parties involved in the conflict could have been expected. Efforts must continue in pursuit of a settlement allowing for the establishment of a broadly based Government of national reconciliation that will enable the country to face its future reconstruction with optimism, with no possibility of a return to a recent past which inflicted so much suffering on the Cambodian people.
We have followed with interest the proposals by the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in bilateral talks. President Roh's initiative submitted at this forum on 18 October of last year was particularly praiseworthy. However, tension on the peninsula still prevails. This can be overcome only through intensified dialogue and greater flexibility.
The tragic events that took place in China deeply moved large sectors of international public opinion. We are following the evolution of the situation with the greatest interest and we hope that the process of reform and openness in all its aspects, including the political, will gain strength shortly, in order to satisfy the Chinese people's legitimate aspirations to liberty and democracy.
The Maghreb is a region of special interest to Spain. My Government has already expressed its satisfaction at the historic agreement reached at the summit in Marrakesh, at which the Maghreb Arab Onion was set up.
We must increase the co-operation and efforts aimed at solving the Western Saharan problem. Spain is following developments in this respect with justifiable concern. The positive steps taken last year - and particularly the acceptance in principle by the parties involved of the Secretary-General's proposals for the holding of a referendum on self-determination in satisfactory conditions, under United Nations supervision - gave a great impetus to the process, which nevertheless has not yet finally crystallized. Spain, which is providing all the necessary technical co-operation, continues to support unreservedly the efforts aimed at unblocking the process. The pursuit of direct contacts between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front could contribute significantly to that.
The Cyprus problem has yet to be solved despite the renewed efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. The interruption of the inter-communal dialogue is a cause for concern. We state once again that the solution must be based on respect for the unity, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, pursuant to the relevant United Nations resolutions.
In the Middle East, prospects for achieving a just solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict remain uncertain. The situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate dramatically. We deplore the measures of collective punishment carried out by Israel, which have merely increased the already great; suffering of the population. We appeal to the Israeli authorities to abide by the Security Council resolutions on the subject and to respect the provisions of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which is fully applicable to the occupied territories.
We believe that the permanent members of the Security Council have an important part to play in achieving a rapprochement between the parties to the conflict and facilitating the convening of the International Peace Conference. The Palestine Liberation Organization must participate in that Conference, which we still believe to be the appropriate framework for bringing about the opening of direct negotiations between the parties involved.
The guidelines of the policy of the Twelve are reflected in the Madrid Declaration referred to by the current Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Dumas. We trust that the appeal that we made in Madrid to the parties involved lead to peace and will not be disregarded. President Mubarak's efforts to bring about talks between Israel and a Palestinian delegation deserve our support, with a view to an overall, just and 1,as ting solution based on the principle of peace for territories.
In that context, our call for moderation and good sense in Lebanon is even more peremptory. There has been a tragic deterioration in the crisis. Violence has claimed thousands of innocent lives, including that of the Ambassador of Spain in Beirut, Mr. Pedro de Aristegui. We confirm our backing for the work of the Tripartite Committee. Once more we call upon all the parties to the conflict to co-operate unreservedly by immediately establishing and respecting a total cease-fire, which will enable the necessary internal reforms to be implemented and make peace possible in a sovereign, independent Lebanon, free of foreign forces.
Central America has continued to be the focus of the international community's special attention. The Security Council has given explicit backing to the Central American agreements. Over the course of recent months we have had clear evidence of the political will of those directly involved to overcome their differences and find solutions through dialogue. The El Salvador agreements reached last February and the recent Tela summit conference of Presidents outlined a very positive set of initiatives.
That progress also owes a great deal to the tenacious action of the Secretary-General aid his collaborators. At the express wish of the Central American Presidents, the United Nations is playing an important role in this process. The time-limits foreseen in the Tela agreements have been changed to speed up the process. We trust that the Security Council will adopt the necessary resolutions to ensure that this process will be set in motion as quickly as possible.
Spain is especially hopeful about this process, which it has encouraged from the beginning. It has given - and remains willing to give - all the necessary help within its power. Our will is clear. There is no alternative to this framework for peace. We will support with concrete actions, not just with words, all efforts in this direction. In this connection, I wish to remind you of the support provided by the European Community to the programme for Central American regional economic integration. In this respect, we welcome the discussions which have already begun between the Government of El Salvador and the EMLN, and we trust that these may lead to complete national reconciliation.
In this context I would like to discuss peace-keeping operations. The United Nations is playing an ever greater role in the search for solutions to regional conflicts. We are pleased that it is receiving the necessary backing from the Security Council. Spain has decided to participate in various operations. It has supplied military observers for the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and a significant part of the air component of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. Spain is also willing to co-operate in the operations which will presumably be launched in Central America.
The United Nations has contributed decisively to the process of decolonisation, which, with the forthcoming independence of Namibia, is approaching its conclusion. However, some cases are still pending. One of them is that of Western Sahara, to which I have already referred. East Timor is another. The start of talks between Portugal and Indonesia is a positive element towards a solution in conformity with the principles of the United Nations.
With respect to the Malvinas Islands, we have always supported direct negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom as a means of solving all outstanding problems between the two countries, including that of sovereignty. There have recently been new expectations of dialogue and we hope that the talks to be started by the two countries next month will lead to progress in this direction. We are pleased that both countries, with which we have friendly relations, have chosen Madrid as the place for the holding of these talks.
A particularly anachronistic colonial situation persists on the European continent, which affects the territorial integrity of my own country. No one is unaware of Spanish sensitivities in connection with the question of Gibraltar. We have chosen the path of negotiation as recommended by the General Assembly, with a view to concluding the process of decolonisation through the restoration of our territorial integrity, while at the same time preserving the interests of the Population of Gibraltar as well as those of the population of the 'Campo de Gibraltar'. As regards disarmament, confidence and transparency are. and we hope, will continue to be crucial elements in the process of East-West detente. We must continue to seek the reaction of the existing balances in the various categories of weapons as confidence- and security-building measures. In this process of enhancing security through disarmament and the reduction of levels of armaments, verification must play a fundamental role in order to ensure that agreements are copied with and also to avoid arousing suspicions.
Spain welcomes the progress made in Europe in the field of arms control and disarmament since the last General Assembly At our last summit meeting the countries members of the Atlantic alliance stated our intention to conclude the  negotiations on conventional weapons by the mid-1990s, thus contributing to increasing the security not only of the European continent but also of the international community as a whole.
As regards nuclear weapons and the strategic arms reduction talks (START) we trust that by 1990 the negotiations, including the current ones, will be concluded. To that end, the results of the conversations held last week in Wyoming are encouraging.
The question of arms control and disarmament must not be limited, however, to the East-West dimension. The recent Paris Conference stressed the urgent need for the rapid conclusion of the treaty for the complete and global elimination of chemical weapons. The proposals made by President Bush at the current session and Mr. Shevardnadze's positive response to them are encouraging in this respect.
On the question of human rights we have seen undeniable progress made in some countries, although in many others there has been stagnation, if not regression. We must prevent the economic difficulties encountered in some democracies which tend to perpetuate certain violations of human rights. The task of international codification in relevant aspects of the protection of human rights has recently been considerable, and this gives us great satisfaction.
In particular, I should like to express Spain's support for the draft Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we hope will be adopted at the current session, and the draft Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. Nevertheless, we continue to think that rather than concentrating on creating new international instruments, we must emphasize the proper application of those already in existence. We must strengthen the United Nations mechanisms for the identification and eradication of violations of human rights. In particular, we consider highly desirable both the strengthening of the Commission on Human Rights and increased co-operation with it on the part of Member States.
I wish to refer to some items which continue to be on the United Nations agenda and which, unfortunately, will continue to be for some time. First, with reference to human rights - in regard to which there has been undeniable progress in many countries, although in others the matter has been at a standstill and in still others it has been retrograde - we must not allow the economic difficulties suffered by some democracies to perpetuate certain violations of human rights.
I wish to highlight our particular satisfaction with the strengthening of democracy and freedom taking place in Latin America. We are convinced that the forthcoming elections in Chile will lead to the full restoration of freedom in that country. However, the urgent economic problems, which in some countries coincide with the advancement of freedom, democracy and human rights, have given rise to a new phenomenon: economically poor democracies.
The latest report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) points out that there are three problems that have been fuelling one another and leading to a vicious circle: external debt, domestic financial instability, and social and economic stagnation. A number of Latin American countries have failed in their attempts to stabilize and revive their economies.
The burden of debt is strangling many countries. There can be little optimism about the expectations for growth and about inflation in the Latin American countries next year, Patience, tenacity and imagination will be required. We need to build a new global framework for the purpose of redesigning the debt strategy, while at the same time approaching each case individually. The objective is not merely to attain economic growth in those countries, but rather to sustain its development.
Here we must work on two fronts. True, the debtor countries must continue to strive to increase the competitiveness and flexibility of their economies, without dissembling the cost to society. The international community must facilitate the obtaining of adequate external financing through a combination of three elements: repatriation of capital, the reduction of debt and of its servicing and new loans.
I should like to point out the important role of the Brady Plan concerning debt reduction. Here, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank must work together; designing and supervising the adjustment and growth programmes and also contributing to reinforcing debt reduction transactions through the channelling of new funds.
Spain has proposed that a European guarantee fund be set up in the European Community. This initiative was discussed in the Council at Madrid. The European Community has become even more aware of the magnitude and seriousness of the debt problem, as was seen at the meeting we had in Grenada with the Permanent Mechanism for Consultation and Political Co-operation, the Group of Eight.
The main goal is balanced economic development for the less favoured countries. Price oscillations and problems affecting some commodities do not help to achieve this goal. These commodities are of great importance in the export earnings of a large proportion of developing countries. We must regulate the commodities market, hearing in mind the component of co-operation and development aid. We are pleased about the coming into force of the Common Commodities Fund, putting an end to the deadlock which has lasted for 10 years.
We are also pleased, within the context of international trade, by the unblocking of the Uruguay Round.
Finally, we should recall here that the high level of indebtedness and the fall of export earnings in commodity markets have in the case of sub-Saharan African countries been combined with the advance of desertification, cyclical droughts and natural disasters to create a tragic situation. We must support, and are doing so, the various financial initiatives that have been advanced by various international organs, at the same time reinforcing the policy of co-operation with the African continent by giving significant economic stimulus for co-operation with those countries.
I should now like to make a very specific reference to North-South relations within the context of the United Nations.
Next April the General Assembly will hold a special session on international economic co-operation and the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries. We believe that this will be an ideal occasion to achieve, among ourselves, a realistic economic consensus on a world scale. Work in this direction must proceed along with the preparations for a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade, the launching of a new substantive programme of action for the less developed countries, at the Paris Conference in September 1990, and, lastly, the International Conference on the Environment and Development, in 1992.
In referring to the environment, I should like to point out that international co-operation of a new kind is necessary in trying to solve another problem that affects nothing less than living conditions on our planet. The recent Hague Declaration, adopted at a conference at which countries all over the world were represented, states that as the problem is planetary, its solution can only be conceived at a world level and that it has three characteristics: it is vital, urgent and global.
The holding in 1992 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development should be focused on an analysis of these problems, apart from co-operation between the North and the South, and hence on consideration of the environmental factor in programmes of development aid.
The Conference will of course deal with questions of world dimensions, such as the greenhouse effect, protection of the o2one layer, the trans-border movements of wastes, and other things. These affect all countries but have major implications for the developing countries, both economically and financially, as well as with respect to technological support and transfers. It is an enormously delicate subject, and any solution therefore must be based on mutual respect and co-operation in a joint effort.
Spain agrees with the Bruntland report recommendation that environmental problems be tackled while taking the different regional situations into account.
I would recall that the European Community has already taken some important steps in some respects for preservation of the global environment. Among these general problems I have referred to, which form part of the new agenda of the United Nations, as I put it, I would like to add a few words about terrorism and drug trafficking. In spite of the efforts of the international community terrorism still gravely endangers the lives of countries and coexistence among nations. This threat manifests itself individually in each country, but it is a collective threat. Terrorist attacks are an act of aggression against the whole international community. We therefore have to strengthen international co-operation. Sensitive to this need, the General Assembly succeeded in achieving an important consensus against terrorism in resolution 40/61. Today, it is our task to consolidate and develop it.
We cannot talk of terrorism without talking about drug trafficking, they are so often connected. In his annual report the Secretary-General reminds us that 'the monetary value of drug trafficking has recently surpassed that of international trade in oil and is second only to the arms trade'. (A/44/1, p. 23)
We are, then, faced with a problem of tremendous ramifications. The way to fight this threat is through concrete international co-operation, accompanied by reinforcement of each country's domestic measures.
The International Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs is a far-reaching instrument. All Member States should adhere to it without delay.
We should also make progress in harmonizing and bringing national legislations closer to each other. There are matters that must be resolved urgently. We must activate this process. The 1983 Convention can serve as a framework of reference.
As a result of that Convention, the importance of the so-called precursors for drug synthesis has been made clear. Precursor-producing countries must make an effort to control their exports and thus co-operate in repression of the illegal drug trade.
Drug consuming countries also are responsible for the drug-trafficking phenomenon and must carry out programmes and action directed at decreasing domestic demand and thus reducing the traffic in drugs. For some years Spain has been developing educational and preventive measures to this end.
We should not forget, either, on this major theme of narcotic trafficking, actions designed to investigate large capitals, properties and the bank accounts of alleged drug traffickers, actions that have made possible a qualitative change in the fight against this scourge. The world banking system shares responsibility for the solution of this problem. We therefore ask for its co-operation. Similarly, it is necessary for the so-called tax havens to understand that hiding information related to business derived from drug trafficking is tantamount to collaborating in one of the most serious acts of aggression against mankind.
We have to continue pursuing action in support of and in co-operation with Governments and peoples of coca-producing countries, helping their economic development and generously promoting alternatives to cultivation of this substance.
The action taken by the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control has proved effective for this purpose.
I should like to stress that there has been exemplary action, which we support, by Colombia, which should receive an adequate response from international bodies in this cause. In Colombia what is at stake is the capacity of the State based on the rule of law to stand up to a group of criminals who are attempting to destroy its basic structures.
In contusion, I should like to make a brief observation. As I have said throughout this statement, international co-operation must now go beyond the mere fundamental pursuit of peace. We must improve the quality of international life, so that we also improve the quality of national life, aid above all the personal life of each individual. We must strive to achieve a new world in which all men and woman count. This Assembly and the United Nations as a whole, will face not fewer but more problems. I trust they will contribute significantly to their solution.
There are some old questions among these new problems, often urgent. We have spoken of poverty and marginalization, and of the threats of drug trafficking and terrorism, which threaten our whole planet and the environment. The time left to us before these problems become catastrophic is not without limits} it is, indeed, rather short. The solution lies in our own hands if we are willing to co-operate. Thus, Spain believes we are witnessing a new era in the history of the United Nations.
","Ideological intransigence, confrontation as a means of diplomacy and indifference to the overwhelming economic, social and political problems of a significant part of mankind have started to give way in the face of mankind's growing aspirations to broaden the scope of coexistence, to lay the foundations of true peace and to consolidate the notion that the individual is the direct and primary beneficiary of all government action. I refer, for example, to issues such as the differences between rich and poor countries, economic development, man's relationship with nature and the progressive deterioration of the environment, and phenomena such as terrorism and drug trafficking - to which I shall refer later in my statement. The growing political realism of many countries which in the past were reluctant to accept solutions that were not extreme; the progress towards more pragmatism in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries; the resolute action of the Security Council reinforced by the new co-operation among its permanent members; and the intelligent work of the Secretary-General are basic elements of that stimulating process. Efforts must continue in pursuit of a settlement allowing for the establishment of a broadly based Government of national reconciliation that will enable the country to face its future reconstruction with optimism, with no possibility of a return to a recent past which inflicted so much suffering on the Cambodian people. We must support, and are doing so, the various financial initiatives that have been advanced by various international organs, at the same time reinforcing the policy of co-operation with the African continent by giving significant economic stimulus for co-operation with those countries."
44,1989,SUR,"ï»¿
 

Like many other countries in the developing world, Suriname has been confronted in this decade with falling prices of our main commodities, with difficulties in penetrating the markets of the industrialized nations, with obstacles to creating a solid democratic society, and, moreover, with the benign but distant interest of some of our developed sister nations in the difficult process of underpinning the political changes taking place in our country with the security of provision for the basic needs of the people.
We must admit, however, that while these experiences have had a negative impact on the steady pursuance of our development objectives, they have at the same time strengthened our determination to meet the challenges that face us and to redouble our efforts to achieve the goals we set for ourselves years ago. For that reason we have once again come to New York with great pleasure, to share with you our experiences and be part of the new, emerging political understanding between and within independent nations.
Before doing so, however, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers and congratulate you. Sir, on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am pleased to see a representative of the African continent, with its ongoing historical political development, in the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Africa, with its great diversity and economic possibilities, can play a decisive role in shaping the new, emerging political relations and co-operation in our world. It is also fitting, indeed, that a son of our brother country Nigeria, with which Suriname has historical ties, has been chosen, since that country has served as an example because of its contribution to unity and integrative in Africa, and to international co-operation and peaceful coexistence. Your experience and diplomatic skills, demonstrated as Chairman of the Special Committee against apartheid, justify our sincere expectation that under your leadership this session of the General Assembly will come to a successful conclusion.
We should also like to express our profound appreciation to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the distinctive and able manner in which he guided the affairs of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We wish him well in his future endeavours. Likewise, we should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his personal contributions to the search for peace, security and stability in the world. His tireless efforts to strengthen the Organization and to achieve solutions to the numerous conflicts threatening international peace and security, as well as his dedication to the cause of sustained development in the developing countries, is well known and deserves our gratitude.
Concerning Suriname, it is with a feeling of pride and satisfaction that I can announce that our Government has succeeded in gratifying the cherished wish of the majority of the people of Suriname by actively starting the termination of the internal armed conflict. This fight in which brother took up arms against brother had been going on for years. Convinced that combating violence by violence would not bring peace and prosperity to our people, we opted for the road of dialogue and consensus. This road recently led to the conclusion of the peace agreement of Kourou, which in turn set off a genuine peace process and brought an end to the meaningless bloodshed, the victims of which were mostly innocent people.
We are aware that we have only just begun and that we shall certainly encounter many obstacles on our path. But, armed with reason, humanity, friendship and solidarity - qualities for which our people are noted - we shall overcome those impediments. Today, a new, important step forward is being taken in the peace process and the process of dialogue and consensus. The peace agreement has already resulted in the abolition of the state of emergency in the eastern part of the country. Because of this, real prospects for the safe and speedy return of thousands of  refugees to their homelands have been created, through the contributions of international agencies as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are indispensable, and we are indeed grateful for the assistance they are rendering.
At this juncture, I should like to express my Government's appreciation for the activities of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with regard to the problems of refugees, and uprooted and displaced persons in general. We therefore applaud the Guatemala Declaration and the Complementary Plan of Concerted Action, which were adopted at the first International Conference on Central American Refugees, as important steps in the right direction.
Now we, the Government and people of Suriname, are once again in a position to fulfil out internationally agreed obligations towards our countrymen in the eastern part of our country. Once again these fellow-citizens of ours will be able to make use of the political, social and economic rights they ate entitled to.
The last phase of our democratisation process has thus started and, hopefully, peace and stability will soon once more characterize our Surinamese society. Without united efforts, we shall then be able to work for the economic, social and political reconstruction of the country as a whole. Because of the peace agreement, our people are able to dream again, to dream of a new horizon, of a future of genuine peace and prosperity which they can make come true through their own efforts.
I am also happy to be able to observe that positive developments have taken place in the formerly strained relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname. We express the fervent hope that these developments will be expanded, strengthened and consolidated, to the mutual benefit of both nations. Allow me at this time to present in brief our position on a selected number of international issues. After years of effort and persistence and through the tireless and patient exercise of the good offices of the Secretary-General, significant progress may be observed in the field of international relations.
It is indeed with satisfaction that we are witnessing that the practice of detente has been reborn and that a new style and new attitude have emerged in the conduct of international relations} that new approach, whereby confrontation has been replaced by dialogue and understanding, has already resulted in negotiated solutions to some regional conflicts which had hitherto seemed unsolvable.
The Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and their ongoing discussions regarding other matters of great importance to international peace and security the agreement between Iran and Iraq the Geneva Agreements with regard to Afghanistan and Pakistan; the scheduled independence of Namibia; and the recent agreement on the Central American conflict are all good examples of the lessening of political tensions in the world.
These developments augur well for the future of our planet and although we should not expect that conflicts which have lasted for years and have deep-rooted causes will immediately be settled, I feel obliged to urge the parties concerned to respect the agreements  d to refrain from tactics and measures which could delay or even stifle the peace process.
I especially refer to the recalcitrant attitude of the apartheid regime of South Africa, which continues with killings and harassment of the Namibian people notwithstanding the peace agreements signed in December 1988. My Government condemns the involvement of both the military and civilian authorities of the apartheid regime, which intimidates and victimizes the Namibians, obstructing them in the exercise of their legitimate right to elect a Government of their own choice.
At the same time it is encouraging to note that the countries of Central America have demonstrated their firm political will to reject the use of force and to restore a climate of trust and tranquillity in their region. The agreement recently reached has highlighted the profound desire for peace of the Central American peoples and their commitment to negotiation and to dialogue to resolve long-existing conflicts, and thus deserves the full support of the international community.
In spite of the positive trends of accommodation and detente, some hard cotes of suppression and conflict still persist. In spite of continuous condemnation by the international community the apartheid regime of South Africa continues its policies of discrimination, detention and suppression of the majority of its people.
Events of recent months have brought no comfort to those who hoped to see the apartheid system dismantled. Only when this institutionalised racism is totally eradicated will peace and security be assured in this part of the world.
The situation in the Middle East continues to be unstable and dangerous. The question of Palestine remains the core of the Middle East problem and the prime example of disregard of United Nations resolutions and of the will of the international community. My government deplores the deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories and the constant increase in the number of Palestinians slain or wounded. We believe that only an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations, and with the participation of all parties concerned, will be able to establish a viable, negotiated framework to address all the dimensions of the conflict and being hope for restoring peace and security to the region. In this respect we welcome the efforts of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt as an opportunity to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process. I sincerely hope that mankind will soon witness progress and tangible results in the form of a lessening of tension and confrontation in regional conflicts.
Regarding the Kampuchean problem, my delegation is of the view that a just and durable peace in Kampuchea can be reached only through a comprehensive political settlement, one which takes into account the interests and aspirations of the people of that nation.
As I said before, my Government believes in dialogue and in this sense we welcome the resumption of contacts in the Korean peninsula. Even though no concrete advance has as yet been noted, we hope that the dialogue with a view to the ramification of the two Koreas will be intensified and that the proposals of 11 September 1989 by President Roh Tae Woo may serve as a basis.
Although we have made optimistic observations with regard to changes in the international political arena we note with disappointment that international economic prospects remain uncertain. Slow or negative growth and the persisting debt problem are causing further deterioration of the quality of life in the <1evelÃ¶ping countries. Never has the situation of the developing countries been more adversely affected than during the past decade.
Governments of developing countries have instituted courageous reforms in order to revitalize their economies, but their experience has been that economic adjustment programmes have been disproportionately heavy and have had very severe social and political consequences for them. Their experience has been that without massive external support the successful and positive influence of economic growth and development will remain illusory. As a consequence of these developments the economic disparities between industrialized and developing countries have widened.
About 40 years ago it seemed as though the international community had learned a valuable lesson from the enormous tragedies of the 1930Ð·. Much to our regret, however, we must observe that the present outlook is proof to the contrary. The style of dialogue and the understanding which have characterized international political relations during the last few years and which have resulted in many negotiated agreements, have unfortunately not yet trickled through to international economic relations. On the contrary, we notice an approach which does not recognize the needs of developing countries and does not assist them to lift themselves out of their poverty and modern development.
There is a lack of political will to consider comprehensive measures which take into account the new realities and changing circumstances in the international economic environment. These measures should include development objectives such as poverty reduction, long-term solutions to foreign debt, development financing, and reactivation of the international economy. Such comprehensive measures should also include redefining international economic relations, removing the structural imbalances in the international economic system and preventing the further widening of the economic and technological gap between industrialized and developing countries.
I should like to stress that the lofty goal of a more just and equitable distribution of the world's riches can be reached only if multilateral co-operation for economic and social development is revitalized and strengthened. We are not asking for pity or mere sympathy but for new economic conditions which recognize our needs and help to ensure that we, the developing countries, can lift ourselves out of our poverty and underdevelopment. We therefore urge our developed partners to show their political readiness to widen the field of multilateral economic understanding during the preparations for the fourth international development strategy and during the special session on international economic co-operation. Shortly after the independence of Suriname the Surinamese Government participated actively, as a member of the Ad  Hoc Committee, in the preparation of the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 and which has been in force since June 1983. 
Despite the setbacks of recent years, in which hostage killing was added to the chapter of human suffering, my Government remains confident that the convention against the taking of hostages and other relevant instruments will serve the purpose for which they were created. My delegation is of the view that murder and terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstances.
Suriname has since its inception been a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. Ten years ago, this matter was placed on the agenda of the General Assembly for the first time. The Ad Hoc Committee has made tangible progress since then, as reflected in its successive reports, but, because of certain conflicts of interest, the badly needed convention is still pending. Meanwhile, the activities of mercenaries continue to create a devastating atmosphere in many developing countries. The Special Rapporteur on Mercenaries has repeatedly drawn the attention of the world community to the subversive practices of mercenaries. An adequate convention, together with concerted international actions directed towards combating the phenomenon of mercenaries, will have a tremendous impact on the eradication of this evil. It is for these reasons that our Government expresses the hope that the General Assembly will be in a position to finalize the drafting of the desired international convention at the earliest possible date.
During the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, it was recognized that the cessation of nuclear-weapon testing would be an important contribution to the goal of ending the qualitative improvement of these weapons and the development of new types, and prevention of their proliferation. Despite the General Assembly's insistence in later years, this goal has not been reached, although we have to admit that recently some progress has been made. In this light, we welcome the reduction of tensions in East-West relations, since this provides the basis for more effective action in freezing nuclear-weapon production and subsequently dismantling nuclear weapons. However, given the importance of such action for the survival of mankind, we feel that discussions aimed at achieving complete nuclear disarmament should not be merely bilateral, but a multilateral undertaking. A multilateral approach will more successfully guarantee that the interests of the whole of mankind are served,  d that the resources derived from disarmament will be used for economic and social development.
My Government shares the view that nuclear-weapon-free zones are an essential contribution to the promotion of peace and stability. We therefore call upon all States to co-operate in the establishment of such zones. As a party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, we appeal to the States which have not yet done so to join ranks and try to keep the Latin American and Caribbean region nuclear-weapon free.
Furthermore we wish to stress that disarmament in the field of conventional and chemical weapons should not be neglected. It has been reported, at the Conference on Disarmament during its Geneva session in the summer of this year, that about 20 countries still have arsenals full of chemical weapons. These horrific means of mass destruction should undoubtedly be eliminated. It is high time that a chemical weapons ban treaty with a very tight verification system be concluded under the auspices of the United Nations.
The drug problem is doubtless one of the most serious universal concerns of today. It is not merely a problem that undermines out economies and endangers the physical health of our peoples) recent developments in our regime demonstrate that the abuse of and illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances also increasingly threaten the social and political stability of our countries. We have witnessed the developments in this context in one of our sister countries in the Western Hemisphere. We firmly support that country's Government in its efforts to combat the organized drugs mafia and its severe negative social, economic and political impact. Because of the international dimensions of this problem, my Government underlines the need for intensive regional, interregional and international co-operation in order effectively to deal with this plague of mankind. In this connexion, we welcome the recent initiatives of Governments in our region. We are of the opinion that these initiatives deserve the fullest support of the international community. We furthermore believe that the relevant United Nation s agencies and the other international and regional institutions involved should be encouraged in their endeavours, and that financial resources must be committed to assist them in their battle to eradicate the scourge of narcotic drugs.
As time goes by, we notice that our planet is no longer the same safe haven for mankind if; used to be. The international community recognizes more and more that environmental issues such as climate changes, the conversion of fertile land into desert, the depletion of freshwater resources and the disposal of hazardous chemicals are jeopardizing our ecological systems as well as the most vital interests of mankind. Although environmental problems have grave effects on the development of third world countries in particular these problems should have the attention of the international community as a whole. Given the vital and urgent global character of our environment, a multilateral approach is required to tackle these environmental problems in all their aspects, and the contributions and co-operation of the industrialized nations are indispensable and of major importance. My delegation therefore looks forward to the convening in 1992 of the United Nations conference on environment and development, which we hope will be held on our continent.
It is essential that measures in this context take note of the necessity of eliminating or reducing the imbalance in international production and consumption patterns. One of the major malpractices against the environment that should strongly be rejected is the dumping of nuclear waste and hazardous chemicals by industrialized countries in developing countries, a practice experienced by the latter as abuse of their unfavourable economic situation.
The Amazon countries, to which Suriname belongs, have adopted a declaration in which, inter alia, they express their firm intention to widen and strengthen the mechanisms for co-operation committed to the protection of the environment in the Amazon region. We are fully aware of the region's importance to the world, and we are capable and responsible enough to protect it.
I have tried to stand up in plain view and make what I hope has been a clear, forthright statement of out position, because I wanted the Assembly to know exactly where our country stands, what it advocates, and what it believes. It is true that in our efforts to obtain our cherished goals, we, the United Nations, have lost some ground. We have not been spared certain disappointments and unpleasant surprises. At the same time, however, we have learned by experience. We have learned that peace, development and prosperity are not to be had by merely asking. Like other great ideals, they can only be obtained through hard and consistent effort.
As we stand on the threshold of the 1990s, I am pleased to observe that today's developments in world affairs give us cause for a certain optimism for the future, a future in which our ever more indivisible and interdependent world beholds a new horizon, a horizon holding out the promise of peace, development and prosperity for all. Let us, then, proceed to examine specific ways and means to make the goals and end results we seek possible. It is our profound hope and expectation that our Organization will have a vital role to play in this coming new era. 
","We must admit, however, that while these experiences have had a negative impact on the steady pursuance of our development objectives, they have at the same time strengthened our determination to meet the challenges that face us and to redouble our efforts to achieve the goals we set for ourselves years ago. These developments augur well for the future of our planet and although we should not expect that conflicts which have lasted for years and have deep-rooted causes will immediately be settled, I feel obliged to urge the parties concerned to respect the agreements  d to refrain from tactics and measures which could delay or even stifle the peace process. During the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, it was recognized that the cessation of nuclear-weapon testing would be an important contribution to the goal of ending the qualitative improvement of these weapons and the development of new types, and prevention of their proliferation. One of the major malpractices against the environment that should strongly be rejected is the dumping of nuclear waste and hazardous chemicals by industrialized countries in developing countries, a practice experienced by the latter as abuse of their unfavourable economic situation.

44,1989,ARG,"ï»¿

 

I should like to begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to head the work of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. You represent Africa, a continent linked to the most difficult and successful of the struggles of the United Nations, You also represent a country, Nigeria, that has played a significant role in promoting the principles and purposes of the Organization's Charter. We know of your efforts in the Special Committee against Apartheid, and in you we see a standard bearer in the fight to eradicate the vile practice of racial discrimination from southern Africa.
I should also like to salute the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, who, on behalf of our country, accepted the responsibility of presiding over the General Assembly.
I have always believed it to be impossible to imagine the future of one's country without reflecting upon the reality of the world around us, impossible to have a correct national vision without a correct international vision, impossible to progress if we cover our eyes and grope our way forward without knowing what is going on in a constantly changing world.
For that reason, here in this highest forum I wish to speak about some of our concerns, goals and ambitions. I wish to talk about our fears and also about our hopes. I wish to talk about risks and also opportunities. In short, I have come to share with you our dreams and our realities.
What is politics, if not the focal point of our will and our ideas? History summons us, and we cannot turn our backs on it. There is a challenge before us, there is a clamour around us; there is an inescapable responsibility. The twenty-first century must be the century of a true renascence. It will demand greatness to do away with selfish criteria that are merely partisan, ideological, class-related, religious or racial. It will demand intelligence to understand the problems of our times from a global standpoint. It will demand resolve if we are not to confine ourselves to mere words.
Today, to defend what is ours we must be aware of everyone's world. What was a humanitarian option yesterday is now an imperative. We feel that we are all united in the face of great world problems that require co-operation and responses in a spirit of solidarity.
There is only one world. There is only one human dignity. There is only one home for all mankind. An understanding of those realities is not a minor detail of the history through which we are living. What is at stake is the difference between peace and war, between progress and decadence, between development and poverty, between life and death.
The century that is about to end has been marked by unprecedented technological and scientific progress, but it has also been marked by atrocious wars, by genocide and by new threats. We must be aware of that interplay of light and shadow, and we must prepare ourselves to ensure that the twenty-first century will be set upon the right road towards the desired harmony.
I think that the time has come to reformulate old ideas, to dust them off and update them and to make them consonant with the contemporary world; that is why the concept of international security must be re-adapted to the new realities.
 
Today, insecurity is no longer limited merely to the danger of a nuclear confrontation between super-Powers. There is another world insecurity: it is the risk that the world may once again be split up, this tine into North and South; it is the inability to harmonize economic development on a global scale. There can be no peace or international order in a world given over to the irrationality of inequality. For decades we have been appealing to the conscience of universal peace, that everything be done to end the East-West split.
Today, here and now, we must do likewise to avoid the equally dangerous North-South split, which would bring us into the twenty-first century with two totally opposite universes: a rich, affluent society facing a majority of increasingly impoverished countries. In the same way, it is necessary to give deep thought to the dangers threatening the ecological balance and the human environment.
For all of us, man cannot become the predator of man. ''Our planet is not a degradable entity. Development is not a mere mathematical equation. Technology is not a mirage that must merely destroy mankind's home. An appropriate form of production must be founded on wise management of renewable resources and decreasing consumption of irreplaceable raw materials and energy. Furthermore, it is necessary to rescue the cultural values, the quality of life, the style and tradition that are inherent in the identity of every nation. It is essential to encourage man's progressive rediscovery of nature, water, earth, air, plants and the animals of creation. These are substantive issues that require a political awareness and a resolute response before it is too late.
The concern of philosophers, sociologists, anthropologists, theologians and poets can no longer proceed independently of the mediocre universe of the policy of mere efficiency. I do not believe in the illusory domination that involves a real danger to the destiny of the world. The United Nations is the ideal forum in which to forge that conscience required by changing circumstances. It is obvious, furthermore, that the present political horizon does give us reason for hope. We can see a climate of detente taking shape not only at the level of ideological-political opposition between the super-Powers, but also in regional conflicts. In the last five years we have seen concrete steps taken along that long road towards overcoming the cold-war climate.
Solid progress has been achieved in disarmament, such as the historic 1988 treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States. Such progress may point to the beginning of the definitive overcoming of the irrational arms race. That event is exemplary because it has positive repercussions on other conflicts.
I think we should all thank the Secretary-General for his determination, his wise, concrete, untiring and hopeful activities - even at times when it seemed impossible to have any reason to feel hopeful. Suffice it to recall the progress made towards peace in the conflict between Iraq and Iran, and in defusing the problems of Cyprus and Afghanistan. With regard to the questions of Kampuchea and the Western Sahara, we hope that the Secretary-General will continue to receive the support that is essential for the final attainment of peace.
It is also our hope that a fair solution can be reached on the Korean issue. We sincerely hope that next November elections will be held in Namibia and that its long-suffering people may be represented at the next session of the General Assembly and that we may welcome it to our midst as a new independent and democratic State. That will be a decisive step towards normalizing the situation in the southern cone of the African continent.
But much more is needed, without the final eradication of apartheid in South Africa, the spark of violence will not be extinguished, what kind of peace can be guaranteed if it is based on silence with respect to the exclusion and daily violation of the most elemental human right, the right to equality?
We Argentines have a special debt of gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for the role he has played in regard to our regional conflict - that of the Malvinas Islands. This issue is directly linked to peace and disarmament. From the moment our Government came to power, we have sought to join in the general climate of detente. That is why we have taken positive measures. We have extended our hand, showing our willingness to enter into dialogue, while in no way casting any doubt on our historical and inalienable rights to sovereignty over those South Atlantic islands. The recent concrete steps taken at our initiative are well known. The normalization of bilateral dialogue must be followed by a firm and sensible will to bring an end to an obsolete colonial situation that is historically unsustainable.
This is the appropriate occasion for me to express to the representatives of the vast majority of countries represented here the deep gratitude of the Argentine people. On repeated occasions you have expressed your overwhelming support for our just claim. That attitude and that complete support encourage our hopes for a fair and peaceful solution of this conflict. I should like to assert that we shall struggle unstintingly and peacefully, with reason and perseverance, to recover our Malvinas Islands.
Among the regional conflicts, one which naturally involves us is that of Central America. We favour a negotiated political solution, without external interference. The countries directly involved must find their own solutions. Experience has shown this to be the proper approach. Agreements such as the Tela Declaration reached by the Central American Presidents are proof of that. There can be no solutions if we directly or indirectly disregard the principle of non-intervention. Likewise, conflicts would only increase if attempts were made to postpone the full implementation of democratic pluralism and freedom.
 The question of the Middle East deserves careful reflection. That region is a historical cross-roads of culture. Like any zone of conflict, it can become and indeed has become an area of failure and danger. It is a particularly acute area of danger because of its geopolitical position and the heterogeneous interests that it involves. Cur country reaffirms the need to find an urgent solution for all opposing sectors. That is to say, the solution must include respect for the rights of all parties concerned to self-determination and to live within recognized and safe boundaries. Those rights are applicable equally to Israel and to the Palestinian people. Much has been achieved in the field of intentions and declarations, but, unfortunately, Palestine remains a land of death, pain and growing hatred. Lebanon, in its unfortunate situation, is flagrant proof of the inability to attain peaceful solutions. Our country favours the convening of an international peace conference within the framework of the United Nations in order to bring peace to that region and to negotiate an eventual agreement that will include solid international guarantees until the time when the situation is normalized. That method has made it possible to find appropriate solutions in equally dangerous circumstances. In any event, we shall support any type of negotiation which the parties may agree to with a view to putting an end to the bloodshed.
Our country has sizeable Arab and Jewish communities; they coexist peacefully with their own lifestyles, traditions and religious beliefs. I myself am a descendant of one of those communities and I can bear witness to our modest but not insignificant experience. We Argentines believe, as do any people strengthened by the most heterogeneous immigration, that men can live in peace, whatever their creed, race or colour. Therefore, feeling this problem as one very close to my own heart and experience, I have offered the good offices of my Government, and my own, to work towards a rapprochement of the parties involved, if they so wish, according to the method that they deem appropriate. We are aware of the enormous difficulties of the problem, but we have not wanted to skimp in our efforts or availability with respect to any concrete initiative.
Beyond the problems of peace and disarmament, our Organization must devote its efforts to new issues which, because of their magnitude, are becoming the major universal issues of our generation.
Almost every country is the victim of drug trafficking, whether as a producer, a consumer or an intermediary. This extremely serious problem can be combated only if the international community acts in concert and energetically, pursuing with equal severity drug consumption, trafficking and production. International criminal organizations sometimes believe they are stronger than some States, but that is not true, for they lack moral force and their fight, although violent, is a terminal and desperate one. Our country - and in particular our Government - is willing to wage an all-out war on all fronts against this scourge. We want to extend our law enforcement measures to reach all those involved in drug trafficking. We are providing the Colombian Government with all possible support. On this point, I should like my words to ring out with the full force of a call for shared and joint action. Despite the enormous limitations faced by my country, we have none the less donated three fighter, exploration and surveillance aircraft to our sister republic of Colombia.
I wish now to address one of the major universal problems that affects particularly my country and our Latin American brothers. I refer to the prevailing international economic order. We are one of the countries whose volume of exports is affected by the exclusions or limitations imposed by a system of customs and tariff barriers, subsidies and other restrictions on free competition in the trade in agricultural products. This limitation coincides with demands for the payment of interest on our foreign debt. The industrialized countries which demand absolute respect for financial obligations are the very ones that are limiting our possibilities for recovery by restricting the access of our basic commodities to their markets. This means specifically that many Latin American countries are faced with a situation of having to mortgage their development or demand of their People an extremely high, indeed immoral, social cost, in order to meet their foreign debt obligations.
Our Government is committed to meeting its obligations, but of course we require the necessary reciprocal changes in the conduct of international trade in order to make our effort economically viable so that we may be able to sell our products freely, at competitive and realistic prices. We are not so much afraid of the debt itself as of the persistence of a system that keeps on postponing the prospects of legitimate recovery.
I will not go into detail about these inequities in the world economy. Many of the countries represented here experience it as terrible deprivations, and indeed, their very survival is threatened. This syndrome has been described very accurately. Data on the annual South-North flow of dollars make further comments unnecessary.
What I do want to point out to the Assembly is that in Argentina's current crisis, which is similar in essence to that of many other Latin American countries, the determining factor is the deformation of our economy, coinciding with the perversion of world trade.
In this respect, we are committed to a thoroughgoing reorganization, halting hyper-inflation, streamlining the State and replacing a ruinous economy riddled with financial speculation by what we call the 'productive revolution', so that one who works in the productive chain may benefit.
We realize that it would be inconsistent to call for a fair external order while maintaining injustice and disorder within our own borders. Therefore, our mandate began with a thorough restructuring of our own economic and financial organization. Within a few weeks we have managed to curb the hyper-inflationary process, to lower interest rates and contain the dollar parity. However, we are aware that this internal reorganization would only be a partial effort if not accompanied by economic change on a global scale, because at the world level also, at least in the sphere of the capitalist countries, we suffer from a disease, the privilege of the financial circles - and that of speculation - to the detriment of the fundamental element, productivity. Currency ceases to be a symbol of values and trade becomes the dominating factor of the economy.
Confronted with this reality, our country is taking action at the regional level, from our immediate frontiers, to implement a policy of growing integration and co-operation with our Latin American brothers. Intensive work is being carried out to consolidate and integrate a system of trade, technological exchange and co-operation for production, based upon concrete agreements. Thus, the real content of this effort will be in the hands of businessmen and will not be only at the State level. We trust that in time this important initiative will become the corner-stone of this unity of peoples that is the natural destiny of Latin Americans. However, this task is not limited to our continent. We are trying to extend it to many other countries through trade and technological co-operation.
I have tried to point to some of the central aspects of our position with regard to international problems. We firmly believe that the United Nations has before it a very important task to correct deviations and find the avenues we all desire. The Organization has a mandate, specified in Article 1, paragraph 3, is:
'To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character ...'.
This objective is broad and far from being achieved. None the less, we feel that more than ever it is the essential task of the United Nations to manage the major world problems to the benefit of all and not just at the discretion of a few, even though they are the most powerful.
I repeat. There are not three worlds. There are no levels of mankind that can be ignored. There are no continents that can be left out. There is no individual salvation. The twenty-first century will by built by everyone in the world or the twenty-first century will be a mere illusion. It is essential to avoid any irreparable division of the world, a division that may no longer be political but rather economic.
Our country, like the vast majority of developing countries, aspires to active co-operation with the industrialized countries which, in turn, are affected by the contradictions resulting from their technological growth. This attitude was made clear at the recent Belgrade Conference of Heads of State of the Non-Aligned Countries. There, constructive co-operation prevailed over confrontational impulses.
To conclude, I wish to make an appeal, I should like my words to reach the conscience of all, to reach each heart, without distinction as to creed, dogma, political colours or national factions. I should like each of us to look the other in the eye and to ask ourselves sincerely and frankly? Is this the world our children deserve? Can we feel proud of the world our children will inherit tomorrow? Will we be satisfied when, in the near future, the voice of history and of our blood summons us to judgement?
We cannot mortgage the present. We cannot kill our hope. We cannot murder our dreams. The twenty-first century is not merely a rhetorical turn of phrase. It is not a mere publicity slogan, nor is it a new technological goal. Fundamentally, the twenty-first century is represented in each and every one of c children and young people. The twenty-first century has the face and the look of millions and millions of children and youth, who, today, at this very moment, demand that we face our responsibilities with the intelligence and greatness needed to rule the destiny of the world. The twenty-first century must not be a century of war, anguish, death, hunger, alienation, collective madness, indifference, disease, backwardness or ignorance. Today poverty prevents a billion people from having a minimally acceptable standard of living. One out of five human beings suffers this terrible humiliation, in the last 24 hours - please listen to me - some 40,000 children under the age of five have died from causes related to poor economic conditions. Faced with that situation, we cannot look the other way and feign ignorance. The future cannot be measured in terms of material wealth or poverty alone. We must fight hunger among poor children, and we must also be concerned with the despair of rich children.
In the poor countries, they cannot find the economic means for education, work or well-being, or for survival itself. In the industrialized countries, they feel threatened by education characterized by cruel competitiveness. They are denied the space and time they need for fantasy, and they are forced to enter a world where important values are not always kept alive. In both instances, the developed and under-developed, the young feel confronted by a 'closed world'. The twenty-first century cannot be the mere perpetuation of such a mirage.
I insist we must ask ourselves a question deep within ourselves, a question that may seem cruel and compromising: can we truly feel happy with the universe we have created? Can we look our children and young people in the eye and tell them without hypocrisy that we are going to bequeath to them a world in which it is worthwhile to live? Can we say 'mission accomplished' with a sigh of relief? Can we sleep peacefully while a single defenceless human being is dying from lack of food, medicine, education or love?
I know the answer will not satisfy us, but because I know the answer will bring us together in our conscience, I wish to leave you with this final appeal. Children and young people are the best measure of our behaviour and our decisions. They must be the protagonists of a twenty-first century of hope, rather than becoming the victims of a new millennium of horror. That is why I take as mine the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI, words that are an appeal and a commitment for all men of good will: 'Peace is obviously more than the absence of war. Peace is development; and without development peace is an illusion'.
","I have always believed it to be impossible to imagine the future of one's country without reflecting upon the reality of the world around us, impossible to have a correct national vision without a correct international vision, impossible to progress if we cover our eyes and grope our way forward without knowing what is going on in a constantly changing world. Therefore, feeling this problem as one very close to my own heart and experience, I have offered the good offices of my Government, and my own, to work towards a rapprochement of the parties involved, if they so wish, according to the method that they deem appropriate. Our Government is committed to meeting its obligations, but of course we require the necessary reciprocal changes in the conduct of international trade in order to make our effort economically viable so that we may be able to sell our products freely, at competitive and realistic prices. The twenty-first century has the face and the look of millions and millions of children and youth, who, today, at this very moment, demand that we face our responsibilities with the intelligence and greatness needed to rule the destiny of the world. The twenty-first century must not be a century of war, anguish, death, hunger, alienation, collective madness, indifference, disease, backwardness or ignorance."
44,1989,SLV,"ï»¿

I should like first to express our most sincere congratulations to you, Sir, upon your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at this session. We are certain that your wisdom and experience will enable this momentous gathering to follow a path that will lead to success at a time when very promising prospects of international understanding are emerging and when all the countries represented at this forum of universal harmony will be focusing on examining and discussing the many practical and tragic problems now facing mankind.
I join in the appreciation expressed to Mr. Dante Caputo for the excellent manner in which he performed his task as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. This is a fitting occasion to emphasize here, at the Headquarters of the United Nations, our appreciation and admiration for the tireless and successful efforts made by the United Nations to contribute to peace, harmony, reason and development throughout the world. The efforts of the United Nations are bearing fruit at last. With the assistance of the overwhelming majority of the Member States and with the progressive development of the machinery of the United Nations, we see how it is having a beneficial impact upon mankind, increasingly anxious to live in harmony and co-operation. We note with particular appreciation the outstanding role played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose career and achievements are a special source of pride since he is an outstanding Latin American figure.
We have come, for the first time, to the rostrum of the United Nations filled with emotion and a sense of confidence in order to tell the world the truth about our country, the truth of a people which has suffered and is continuing to suffer from the devastating tragedy of an armed conflict that has gone on for 10 years now. During that time, in striking contrast, our people have managed to build democratic institutions which are unquestionable today, even to the most sceptical or most stubborn opponents.
Those who wished to lead the international community to believe that our Government would represent a historic set-back for El Salvador, today, four months after we came to office, have to compare their distorted intentions or mistaken analyses with our attitude and our actions. In due course we shall refer to that attitude and those actions, but first we wish to re-emphasize, before the universal conscience, our philosophy and our vision of the present and of the future. No one who is even slightly familiar with the situation in our country can be unaware that the main challenge facing all Salvadorans today without exception is the final achievement of peace. We, elected by an overwhelming majority on 19 March of this year, fully grasped this need for peace and reconciliation for our people, and we took up the historic challenge of promoting peace by peaceful, democratic means.
We inherited a shattered national community, a country oppressed by the violence that had gone on for more than 10 years and an economy in ruins, a ruinous State control and systematic destructive activities of extremist forces, together with a land crying out for the restoration of its spiritual values and creative and productive energies. Our commitment, from the very first day we took office - on 1 June - was to accept the responsibility of rebuilding and rescuing the entire society, leaving no one out and giving special treatment only to the poorest of the poor.
In the face of the breakdown of our national community, we set out to work for the unity of all sectors in society, so that no one felt left out of the national destiny, so that no group, entity or sector might feel it enjoyed pre-eminence beyond the rules of harmonious democratic law.
Prom the very first day of our administration we said that we intended to govern, not to rule, because we consider that the people of El Salvador deserve the utmost respect and total devotion of their Government, given my country's institutional maturity and great historic sacrifices. In this we have the firmest, most responsible and profound conviction: we are exercising power by the authority of the people, obtained in free elections that no one has challenged. Today and every day during our administration we shall put this power to the service of peace, progress and freedom for all Salvadorans. We foster the unity of all sectors of the country - political, social, entrepreneurial and labour - so that, with all due respect for the differences that are fully appropriate in a pluralistic democratic process, nevertheless, we Salvadorans can overcome the breaches resulting from bygone violent confrontation.
Against this violence, which took advantage of the socio-economic shortcomings and the institutional mistakes and omissions of the past in order to disguise their ideological fanaticism, we are pitting political reason, measured co-ordination and patriotic arguments within the framework of democracy. This is a reality experienced every day in El Salvador. It is feasible to achieve power by peaceful, civilized means whereby the Salvador an people, which alone holds the right to sovereignty, is free and enabled to elect to office those who offer sufficient guarantees of honest, responsible work directed to the attainment of justice, legal security and the well-being of all.
Imbued with our sense of the obligation to seek social harmony, to preserve peace and tranquillity and the safety of the human person as a member of society, we extended our hand to the insurgents inviting them to return to a peaceful role in our society where all ideological trends have their place today. Our wish for dialogue and our serious pursuit of peace are there for all the world to see.
Our proposal for permanent, continuing, substantive, committed dialogue was met by an initial negative response by the insurgents. Then, as we outlined our commission for dialogue, they again refused. But, convinced of the need to exhaust all channels to achieve a political solution to this bloody conflict, we were prepared to find the necessary patience to achieve the first approaches. Without any arrogance or useless anger, we waited for a positive response. That finally came with the first meeting for dialogue between the Government and the FMLN 100 days after we took office and after some two years of stalemate in the dialogue.
We are deeply gratified to be able to inform the international community today that on 13, 14 and 15 September the first formal accord between the Government of El Salvador and the EMLN was achieved. It lays down the guidelines for permanent dialogue whereby substantial understanding, making possible the total solution to the conflict in the shortest possible time, will be brought about.
The Mexico agreement is historic and significant because it sets out a framework whereby it is possible, through agreements, for groups that are still using weapons to have recourse, instead, to peaceful means to make their political proposals to the Salvadoran people.
That achievement is not something we view as a personal triumph. We are presenting it to the international community as a first fruit of a new way of governing in El Salvador, free from hegemony, demagoguery or fanatical passions. We would repeat here in the General Assembly what we have repeatedly said to our own people: as far as we are concerned, we have clearly defined principles of freedom and democracy and no Salvador an is our enemy and no one should be persecuted because of the fact that he is our adversary.
We are therefore required to fulfil the law and comply with the law, but we also intend to modernise and develop not only our laws but also the administration of justice at all levels of society. We are quite aware that achieving peace will be no easy undertaking. It will require sustained and vigorous effort. But we are also aware that our people will not be prepared to accept failure which would unduly delay further the attainment of peace. Time will tell, so we will wait and see. Consequently, at our next dialogue, on 16 and 17 October in San Jose, Costa Rica, we shall be making a proposal for the complete cessation of hostilities, to bring an end to the shooting within the spirit and letter of chapter III of the Tela Agreements signed in Honduras by the five Central American Presidents in their efforts to achieve firm and lasting peace in the area.
We are not simply proposing a de-escalation of armed conflict; we think that that would mean merely a gradual reduction in the suffering of the Salvadoran people. That suffering - unjust, prolonged and terrible - must be brought to an end once and for all because there can be no moral or political justification for it. Like all men of good will we feel that fratricidal conflict, nurtured and sustained by ideological fanaticism, is the most irrational and hateful form of human rights violation. We have a clear commitment to respect and foster the human rights of the individual, a goal we reaffirm emphatically here today - and I should like my words to be heard around the world. We invite all political and social forces in our country, irrespective of their ideological hue, to join with us in this transcendental task of restoring full harmony in El Salvador on the basis of reasonable discussion, civilized procedures and a serious commitment to development, without which it will not be possible to achieve stable and lasting peace.
To foster this development, which is so necessary and urgent, our Government has commenced a process of gradual economic adjustment based on the modern concept of liberalizing our economy, making possible the reactivation of productive mechanisms and releasing the creative energy of free enterprise. This wide-ranging programme is coupled with a lasting programme for social development which will help the most needy and vulnerable to take part in the drive for development. We do not wish to be systematic benefactors of the indigent but, rather, to equip them with real opportunities so that their poverty can be gradually eliminated. He know that this is a long-term and complex task. It is tantamount to the thoroughgoing economic take-off of an entire country. But if we do not set about this now as a practical, feasible task we shall never find the momentum to overcome the enormous effects of our crisis. Our economic approach is consistent with the new, liberalizing trends flourishing around the world. We are abreast of the times, and that will enable us better to face the clear needs and legitimate requirements of a society that is yearning for a life of peace, freedom and solidarity.
We cannot aspire to the attainment of such a goal of collective humanism without a substantial effort to restore the spiritual and moral values of our land, shaken to the very roots by the scourge of armed conflagration. We are undertaking deep educational reforms to snake education more effective and enlightening. We ate incorporating at all levels the theoretical and practical lessons of human rights and duties, so that future generations of our land can grow up with feelings and convictions that will enable them to respect each other, to accept healthy criticism, to enjoy a democratic life and to love God and their homeland, and to have a deep sense of the need for universal coexistence.
In that respect, we hope the Assembly will approve the draft international convention on the rights of the child at this session so that the children end adolescents of today and tomorrow can live in a more human world. Today we are witnessing the sad reality of the so-called children of war. That is why we are fully aware, personally, that the work of protecting and fostering children's rights mist be an immediate task if the harmonious world that we wish to see tomorrow is to be brought about. Over the past 10 years the conflict in Central America has been a subject of concern and anxiety for the international community. It was thought that it might give rise to an even greater crisis affecting world peace and security.
However, since the signature of the Guatemala Procedure, the Alajuela Declaration and the Declaration of Costa del Sol, and, most recently, the summit meeting in Tela, the situation has gradually changed. There have been substantial changes in the political climate and new and better possibilities have emerged for the restoration of peace. There is no doubt that world detente has had an impact on Central America since it has been understood that confrontation and war are not solutions to any problem; that, on the contrary, instability and tension generate irreparable loss of life and do not contribute at all to improving the lives of our peoples. As Central Americans we are aware of our historical responsibilities, are taking the active role which we alone can take and are adopting our own decisions to resolve our regional crisis.
The determination to achieve, and the real possibility of achieving, political solutions to our problems has demonstrated the illegitimacy of the use of force and violence. That is why the peace efforts have received constant support from the international community - most recently the Security Council's firm and unanimous support in its resolution 637 (1989) of 23 July this year. Today the way is open for further significant and valuable steps to be taken by the Secretary-General to foster peace and democracy in Central America, consistent with the wishes of our peoples as expressed in the commitments entered into by our Presidents.
We are convinced of the need, feasibility, timeliness and legitimacy of the Esquipulas Procedure. I wish to emphasize here that we shall continue to fulfil the obligations that we entered into there. We want a firm, lasting peace. That is why we have accepted and constantly supported the establishment and dispatch of the United Nations observer group in Central America. It will be an extremely significant element in the verification of compliance with the agreements, 
particularly those with respect to support for and/or provision of territory to armed forces which destabilize legally constituted Governments. We urge the forces outside the region to respect the manifest will of Central Americans. They would thus be contributing to peace and democracy and the creation of an atmosphere compatible with reconstruction to assist our peoples.
We consider the absence of democracy to have been the root cause of social and political conflicts in Central American countries and we also see that regional peace is intimately linked to the procedures of national and democratic reconciliation. For that reason we hope that political developments in Nicaragua will result in honest, untainted and open elections in which the Nicaraguan people will have a real possibility to exercise their inalienable right to choose their Government freely and, with equal freedom, to determine the system of Government most compatible with their national interests. We appeal to the international community to lend all due attention and assistance so that in the forthcoming elections in Nicaragua the desired objective can be attained. Understanding our problems and requirements, and in an act of fellowship which serves to strengthen the peace process in our region, the international community has extended support for the measures for Central American economic co-operation drawn up by the United Nations in co-operation with our Governments. We sincerely appreciate this collaboration inasmuch as progress towards these goals will also signify progress towards the solution of some of the most critical problems affecting the countries of Central America.
At the same time, the Government of El Salvador wishes to place en record its appreciation to all those countries that have expressed their support for the peace process in Central America. Our thanks go to the donor community, which has played an active role in humanitarian and development activities. We thank also the relevant United Nations bodies for their work leading to the Central American Conference on Refugees, and for the special co-operation we have received from the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We re-emphasize the value and significance, for all Central American nations, of co-operation and international assistance for the attainment of peace and development. We urge the international community to strengthen economic, technical and financial co-operation with Central America. Peace and development in our region will represent a further contribution to the attainment and consolidation of world peace and security.
To the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, goes our special appreciation for the help he has extended to the Central American Presidents working to assist our peoples.
In respect of the international economic situation, we are bound to regret that the economies of the developing countries have failed to make progress towards resolution of the main problems that beset our societies, which are constantly in a state of crisis. The traditional problems in the fields of health, housing, unemployment, inflation, marginality, poverty, and so on, have been compounded by other imbalances, such as the fiscal deficit and external debt, which, taken together, make even more difficult the process of economic recovery and development in general, and jeopardize the fragile stability and achievements in the political field. It is disturbing that, whereas in some parts of the developed world there is economic growth, conditions in the underdeveloped countries, instead of improving, are getting worse, with a widening gap between rich and poor. This confirms the existence of serious shortcomings in international affairs, which must be corrected so that the benefits of development may be distributed equitably. The international community, particularly the industrialized nations, must be aware that if this trend were to continue, the worsening crisis in our countries could, as has occurred in other regions, ultimately give rise to even greater social conflicts, which would ultimately have an impact on the economies of developed nations.
Ours is an overwhelmingly agricultural country that depends to a considerable extent on the production of coffee. We are carrying out an extensive programme to diversify our exports and industry. Nevertheless, coffee continues to be our essential commodity. We therefore wish to make it clear that we feel that renewal of the International Coffee Convention is essential, we have begun a process of economic reconstruction in the midst of continuing conflict. We are deeply concerned, therefore, that there should be recovery in the coffee market, we believe that a just and equitable agreement would be a very promising sign of international harmony and co-operation.
With respect to external debt, which is a terrible sword of Damocles hanging over the fragile structures of Latin American nations, El Salvador energetically calls for a solution that will take into account the development needs of our peoples and will show that creditors and debtors are jointly determined to stress the human factor, rather than cold statistics, thus demonstrating that the modern world is applying a philosophy of human rights, not only in respect of actual cases but also in respect of the great international problems. In the social sphere, the abuse of drugs, AIDS and international crime, and, at another level, the problems of terrorism and of the environment are subjects of concern to us all, as they have an impact on ail nations. However, we welcome the fact, that, finally, their negative impact, and the need for concerted, co-ordinated action by the international community, has been recognized. In view of the scale of these problems, and of their negative impact on the development of our societies, we must give urgent attention to them. We must do our outmost to achieve positive solutions.
With respect to the specific issue of drug trafficking, we have heard here a dramatic appeal by the President of Colombia, His Excellency Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas, who called for international co-operation. He asked the international community to endorse and support energetically his plan for joint action to eliminate this frightful scourge, which is undermining institutional life in our nations and ravaging our young. We firmly and earnestly support that urgent appeal. Indeed, we are prepared to support any measure, programme or collective step to combat this particularly inhuman and destructive crime. Just as we would reject any expression of terrorism, whatever the argument or pretext employed, we equally oppose drug trafficking, which, as President Barco Vargas rightly said, is a scourge that affects us all.
Despite international detente and the progress that has been made in the resolution of a number of problems, there continue to be trouble spots that represent a threat to world peace and security. In all cases of conflict, we urge the parties involved to seek political understanding, making due use of the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes, and resorting to the facilities of the United Nations system, as on previous occasions when the Secretary-General has done vital work leading to the adoption of measures to resolves disputes. In this context, I wish to refer specifically to the case of Korea and to sake it clear that my Government shares the view that it is essential that the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in permanent dialogue and establish the contacts that are necessary to strengthen mutual trust. Thus they could end all forms of hostility and confrontation and, finally, achieve peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the principle of universality to be found in the United Nations, we consider that the Republic of Korea possesses the essential elements of a State and that it has all the elements qualifying it for membership of the United Nations. That is an aspiration that, indeed, we support.
I have come to this rostrum, from which have been heard the great voices of our times, to convey our humble but steadfast hope for peace and concord in El Salvador as a contribution to the enormous international movement against violence, dogmatism and intolerance. The walls are tumbling - north, south, east and west. We see this as a final freeing of minds around the world - an intense hope for an age in which the force of the spirit will become, once again, the driving force of history. The Government of El Salvador respectfully calls on the international community not to identify us with stereotyped vignettes, but, rather, to judge us by our attitudes and our actions. We want peace, freedom and justice in our long-suffering country, but we will never renounce any of the fundamental freedoms necessary for representative, pluralistic democracy to survive. We are not excluding anybody. We do not seek to pin the blame on anybody for his political ideals, but we call energetically on all to join us in building peace, as a demonstration to our own people, and then to the world, that we are a Government of peace, work and service.
We hope to return here next year with good news of lasting peace in our country. But that does not depend only on us; we seek agreement that will unify the entire society of El Salvador. We, for our part, will do cur utmost to avoid further bloodshed in our land. Every day we remember the words of the Carpenter of Nazareth, the Saviour of the world, who, from the hill above the Sea of Galilee, in the brief sermon that has been left for mankind, said to the multitudes
'Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God.'
 (The Holy Bible, Matthew 5;9)

44,1989,MYS,"ï»¿Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. You bring to the presidency unique qualities drawn from your distinguished record both as a soldier and as a diplomat. We can rest assured that with your vast experience and professional skill the deliberations of the General Assembly will be guided to a successful conclusion.
I should like also to pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr. Dante M. Caputo, who presided with great distinction over the many meetings of the active and eventful forty-third session of the General Assembly.
To the Secretary-General we extend our deepest appreciation for his great efforts and contributions in the cause of international peace and security and in the promotion of international co-operation. We wish to assure him of our continued support for all his endeavours.
It is a matter of great satisfaction to me and my delegation that we are gathered here at the United Nations this year in a more positive international political environment conducive to strengthening the credibility and relevance of the United Nations. The continuing detente between the two major Powers has helped sustain the trend towards the relaxation of global tensions in many parts of the world. It has led to increased political co-operation between them, particularly in the important area of disarmament, and to their increased willingness to help find solutions to regional conflicts.
These positive trends, which began only a few years ago, have strengthened the fabric of international diplomacy. They have injected a new confidence into the diplomatic process, breathed new hopes and inspired a revitalized faith in the United Nations as a vehicle and catalyst for positive global change. For the first time since the birth of the United Nations we are presented with a unique opportunity to reshape the structure of international relations to conform to the clear desire of mankind for peace, stability, economic growth and prosperity.
Restored faith in the United Nations must be matched by tangible action. To start with, that would necessarily entail our making available to it the financial resources it requires to perform its functions, and our full commitment to live up to our respective obligations to respect, uphold and advance the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. It would also require renewing our faith and commitment in advancing the centrality of the United Nations in international affairs vis-Ã -vis the exclusivist new organizations appearing in the international arena. We must be imbued with the same spirit aid vision that brought forth this world Organization 44 years ago.
While being gratified at the generally positive international political climate prevailing today, I cannot but voice my delegation's serious concern over the state of affairs in the international economic arena. We find that despite the efforts and clamour for change the present structure of international economic relations remains outworn, outmoded and ill-suited to the demands of the times. Instead of revamping the inequitable economic system, we now see a trend towards a world even more divided between the haves of the North and the have-nots of the South.
The inequitable and unjust pattern of international economic relations cannot continue much longer without adverse consequences for both the developed aid the developing countries. This matter must be urgently addressed. The United Nations is best placed to be a catalyst in the promotion of a global dialogue in the interest of ensuring a more stable, equitable and fair economic system. Let us find, during the proceedings at the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the still missing collective political will that will move us forward towards attainment of the common good.
Allow me at this point to make a brief and general survey of the global situation and to touch on some of the more pressing political, economic and social issues confronting the international community that are of concern to all of us.
On the international political landscape, I regret to say that despite the ongoing detente between the two super-Powers there remain many areas of unresolved conflict and confrontation in the world. These must be addressed effectively in our quest for a more stable world.
In the Middle East, the new beginnings of peace that were initiated through the historic decisions of the Palestine National Council last November, as well as those initiated by President Arafat during the last session of the General Assembly, have been dashed by the continuing stubbornness of the Israelis. Israel persists in its clear violations of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War despite the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.
The heroic intifadah of the brave Palestinian people is a demonstration of their unshakable faith and their determination to struggle for self-determination, independence and nationhood. They have gained the sympathy and support of virtually the entire international community. This is shown by the increased international recognition of the State of Palestine. It has also led to increased contacts with an ever wider circle of States, in particular the United States.
The election plan proposed by Israel for the occupied Arab territories does not address the fundamental questions regarding the right of the Palestinians to exercise their self-determination. An occupying Power known mostly for its repressive policies cannot expect to win the support of these it is oppressing to legitimise this very oppression through the so-called elections.
My Government continues to believe that a durable, just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian issue can only be achieved through the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In calling on all members of the international community to support the efforts towards the early convening of that Conference my Government would give a special responsibility and leadership role on this question to the permanent members of the Security Council.
The other important issue in the Middle East is that of Lebanon. We are encouraged that, after years of armed conflict aid the heavy toll of death and destruction, Lebanon appears to be set on the path towards a new beginning, with the cease-fire in place and the resumption of political dialogue between the -parties involved. The Arab League and its Tripartite Committee must be given due credit for the welcome turn of events in Lebanon. Their efforts must continue to receive our support and encouragement so that the recent progress in Lebanon could be built upon to achieve durable peace and unity for the country.
There must also be respect for the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Lebanon, and Israel must withdraw from its so-called security zone in southern Lebanon and stop its acts of aggression against its neighbour, in compliance with Security Council resolutions.
It is a matter of great satisfaction to us all that we shall soon be welcoming to our community of nations a new member, Namibia, which, following the elections to be held soon, will attain its independence after long and bitter years of struggle. Malaysia is privileged to be contributing troops to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and to have presided over the Security Council during its adoption of resolution 629 (1989), which, inter alia, set the date of 1 April 1989 for the implementation of the Namibia settlement plan.
The road to Namibian independence has not been an easy one, and problems remain that require the continued attention and vigilance of the international community, particularly of the Security Council. The international community must continue to provide the Secretary-General with the support he needs to ensure the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), despite the difficult circumstances. South African manoeuvres against Namibian political parties, particularly the South West Africa People's Organization, must cease. Conditions conducive to free and fair elections and to ensuring the safety and security of all Namibians must be established in Namibia.
While we are happy at the prospect of Namibia's independence, we must express our abhorrence of the continued existence of apartheid in South Africa. My Government has stated time and again that apartheid cannot be reformed. It must be totally eliminated. Apartheid is the most blatant and criminal form of racial oppression and discrimination to be found anywhere today, aid the Pretoria regime must continue to be shunned and isolated by the international community. Mandatory sanctions, including a  effective oil embargo, must continue to be imposed. Pressure should continue to be applied on South Africa to bring about a truly democratic political system based on the principles of self-determination, majority rule, and universal suffrage.
Despite the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements in April 1988, Afghanistan is still embroiled in a bloody conflict that is now in its ninth year, with no prospects for peace in sight. An unpopular and unrepresentative regime that was installed by force of foreign arms continues to cling to power in Kabul. That regime should realize that peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan can only return through the process of dialogue aid the assumption of power by a popular, broad-based Government.
On the Iran-Iraq situation, Malaysia is gratified that the cease-fire has kept the precarious peace and spared precious lives over the past year. However, we share the universal concern at the lack of progress towards the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), despite the best efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General. As a fraternal Islamic nation, we hope and pray that peace and tranquillity will be restored in the bilateral relations of those two Islamic nations, lb that end, we urge the two sides to continue their dialogue under the auspices of the Secretary-General, so that an early aid mutually satisfactory settlements can be realized.
The situation in Cambodia remains a matter of international concern and deserves the full consideration of the General Assembly. As a neighbouring State, Malaysia is disappointed that a comprehensive political settlement, which is the only way to bring about a durable peace in Cambodia, has not been achieved. The principal components of a comprehensive political settlement have been clearly spelled out by the General Assembly. The total withdrawal of all foreign forces should be an integral part of a comprehensive political settlement. The announcement by Viet Nam of its withdrawal from Cambodia cannot be regarded as credible unless it has been verified and supervised by an effective international control mechanism. It remains Malaysia's conviction that only the United Nations can provide the necessary expertise, authority, and resources to ensure the deployment of an impartial and effective international control mechanism within the framework of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia.
The sad state of affairs in Cambodia, resulting from foreign intervention and occupation, has unfortunately remained, it will become even worse if a solution is not found soon and if the parties concerned remain inflexible.
It is most essential that there be a quadripartite interim Government under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia, pending the holding of internationally supervised free and fair elections. All sides must be willing to compromise. The efforts that were undertaken at the Paris International Conference must be followed up despite the impasse. The international community cannot accept an intensification of conflict, another blood-letting, or the prospect of renewed tragedy and horror. The international community, taking up where it left off in Paris, will not only need to urge the Cambodian factions to agree to an interim sharing of power, but may have to undertake collective initiatives to allow for such a necessary development.
It is imperative for the General Assembly to continue to press for a comprehensive political settlement. The efforts of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and others during the session are directed towards that objective. There must be effective guarantees to Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and neutral and non-aligned status.
In the Korean peninsula, the desire for peaceful reunification enjoys the support of the peoples of the two Korean entities. There have been modalities proposed by both sides for such unification, and the discussions between them should contribute to the strengthening of peace and security in the peninsula and to the attainment of the final goals. Malaysia also pays close attention to any interest in membership in organizations, on the principle of universality.
The unsettled situation in Central America also demands the international community's attention. Malaysia welcomes the initiatives of the five Central American Presidents, including the latest, the Tela Declaration, and the joint plan adopted in Honduras in August this year. It is out hope that all parties and countries concerned will give their close and full co-operation in the implementation of those vital decisions.
Antarctica presents the international community with a welcome opportunity to accomplish multilateral co-operation of a truly universal character in pursuit of the common good of all mankind. We continue to believe that, on the basis of dialogue and cleat appreciation of the collective responsibility for the protection and preservation of this pristine continent, we can arrive at an understanding which can meet the interests of all parties.
It must therefore be a matter of disappointment for all of us that we have not fully used the opportunities during the last seven years to advance our common cause despite the categorical and repeated affirmation by those that are not parties to the Treaty of their commitment to take into account all aspects pertaining to all areas covered by the treaty system.
In our view, this global common, because of its unique characteristics and its significant impact on the world climate and ecosystem, must be accorded every protection against the harmful effects of man's activities, especially the exploitation of its resources. In this connection the banning of prospecting and mining and the regulation of other activities related to the exploration and uses of Antarctica are key elements in the development of an international protection regime for Antarctica, that would make this last frontier a world wilderness preserve.
On the issue of disarmament, obviously the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - between the United States and the Soviet Union was an important breakthrough. It provided for the elimination of an entire class of nuclear missiles from the arsenals of the two super-Powers for the first time in history. In hailing this outstanding achievement Malaysia urges the two super-Powers to press ahead with their negotiations for a 50 per cent reduction of their strategic nuclear weapons so as to pave the way for the ultimate elimination of the nuclear threat.
Unfortunately, this more positive phase in super-Power relations has not contributed much to the multilateral disarmament process. Indeed, except for some progress in the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, there has been very little progress on other issues on its agenda. We would urge the parties concerned fully to exploit the potential of multilateral negotiations, particularly the Conference on Disarmament, in order to expedite the realization of a global comprehensive programme of disarmament.
Malaysia believes that comprehensive nuclear disarmament can be realized only if there is agreement on a comprehensive test ban. We therefore hold the view that a nuclear test-ban treaty is an indispensable step towards nuclear disarmament. At the same time, such a treaty would help preserve the relevance and validity of the Man-Proliferation Treaty. In the absence of progress in the negotiations cm a comprehensive test ban, Malaysia supports the initiative of the group of six non-aligned countries towards the convening of a conference to transform the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty into a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
My Government also believes that on the priority issue of providing 'negative security assurances' to non-nuclear-weapon States, pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, there should be legally binding undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States.
Malaysia is deeply concerned at the increasing use of chemical weapons in regional conflicts. We are, however, encouraged by the tangible progress made in the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in preparing a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We detest the use of such weapons and therefore welcome the reaffirmation of the validity of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on chemical weapons by the Paris Conference on chemical weapons held in January this year. Malaysia welcomes the proposal made recently by President George Bush of the United States pertaining to the destruction of chemical-weapon stocks. We are equally happy over the favourable response of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union to the proposal. There is a clear prospect to go further, and these steps would need to be taken by both the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to banish forever the use of such inhumane weapons of mass destruction.
The other disarmament issues, my Government believes that given the rapid advances in space technology and the increasing threat of the misuse of outer space, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive regime regulating the use of outer space by the international community. It also believes that great efforts should be made at both the international and the regional levels for a limitation and regulation of the conventional arms race, including those at sea. Malaysia continues to support the creation of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world and remains committed to the establishment of a zone of peace, freedom arid neutrality in South-East Asia.
The international economic front, very few encouraging steps have been taken to achieve the stated goals of multilateralism, interdependence and mutual co-operation. Unfortunately, at a time when the world is on the threshold of a new century - which is indeed the dawn of a new millennium - inequities and injustices still remain in international economic relations. The aspirations of millions in the developing countries for better living standards and a more decent way of life remain unfulfilled. The depressed economic conditions arising from, inter alia, low growth rates, external indebtedness and deteriorating terms of trade in many developing countries, coupled with serious social stagnation, will only lead to a political upheaval to the detriment of their societies and peoples, and in some instances threaten the survival of nations.
It should be noted that the struggle of the developing countries to find a better place in the international economic arena has become much more difficult and painful in the face of certain trends in the developed world. The developing countries cannot and should not be marginalized in any new economic environment brought about by the new situation. They must be allowed to benefit from emerging developments such as the process of integration of the industrialized economies of Western Europe into a single market within the European Economic Community. The large industrialized nations, which strike trade and financial deals among themselves, must ensure that they do not place an extra burden upon others to compete for market access and financial resources. The decisions they make must also take into consideration the interests of others, particularly among the developing countries. 
It is in the context of finding ways and means to ensure the harmonization of the interests of all that the United Nations should be given the appropriate role as a forum and organization for facilitating the resolution of various international economic and social problems.
The United Nations can be a useful forum for addressing the various issues, including money, finance, debt, trade and development, with a view to bringing about a fair and equitable trading environment, harnessing the full development potentials of the world and encouraging economic growth and social progress world-wide. Malaysia attaches great importance to the principles of an open international trading system aid increased trade liberalization, which will be meaningless if trends towards unilateralism and protectionism are encouraged.
Malaysia is heartened that serious efforts have been undertaken at the United Nations to examine the question of the revitalization of economic growth and development of the developing countries, and to deliberate upon the question of an international development strategy. The developing countries have very high expectations of these two important events. Malaysia intends to participate actively during the deliberations and we call for commitment on the part of countries at the highest level.
In this age of industrialization and high technology, the environment becomes a matter of concern to everyone. It must be emphasized that the maintenance of a safe environment Is not the sole prerogative of those living in the developed countries. Regrettably, there are many self-appointed guardians of the world's environment, in the developed countries, who think that they can make the world a much safer place to live in if trees were not cut down in the tropical rain forests or if people in the developing countries were to shun modern industrial activities and amenities aid simply carry on with their traditional ways of life. In their enthusiasm to criticize others, they tend to downplay the problems of acid rain in their own countries, the pollution of their rivers and lakes, and the devastation of temperate forests resulting from decades of logging and clearing for urban expansion.
Malaysia believes that on an important question such as the environment, again there should be shared responsibility. Constraints cannot be imposed on the development process in the developing countries because of fear of degradation of the environment. Just as the developed countries are trying to cope with their own environmental problems, the developing countries are conscious of the need to maintain and preserve their own environment while coping with, inter alia, poverty, hunger, social depression and, in many cases, recurrent natural disasters., It would be most unfair if the people of the developing countries were required to stifle their own creativity and development because of mistakes made earlier in the developed countries. Malaysia believes that the United Nations could be a very useful forum in bringing about a clearer understanding of the world's environmental problems. Work in the United Nations system should be encouraged in this regard.
More than a decade ago the Malaysian Government declared that drug abuse and illicit trafficking were not just a social problem. More important, to us they are issues of national security. We continue to regard them as such. We are happy that many others now share our perception. We call upon all countries to address the drug problem seriously, not only within their own borders, but also to enter into concerted and determined efforts to work towards an effective international response to the problem by every means possible.
The time has come for the international community to address the question related to the serious problems and limitations of national Governments in dealing effectively with assaults by the drug empire. The United Nations, with its enhanced credibility and authority, should be able to be the central authority for determining the necessary international response in such areas as law enforcement and interdiction. My Government would support efforts to consider collectively an international authority for the United Nations that would, at the request of nations under challenge, be able to take the necessary steps.
Another matter of pressing concern relates to the global refugee problem, which is further complicated by its interrelationship with political, economic, social and ideological issues. Fortunately, there have been positive developments recently. The international Conference on Central American Refugees held in Guatemala City in May this year marked an important step in identifying new solutions to the problem of refugees, returnees and displaced persons in the region. Similarly, the international Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees held in Geneva in June this year forged a new international consensus on the problem of these refugees, particularly those from Viet Nam and Laos. The unanimous adoption of a comprehensive plan of action by the Conference in Geneva demonstrated the collective will of the participants to find a lasting solution to this long-standing problem. It is our hope that the Governments concerned will be able to translate the various commitments achieved at the Conference into reality as soon as possible.
Malaysia is also concerned at the exodus of people from Bulgaria into Turkey and would urge the Governments of those two neighbouring countries to enter into meaningful negotiations with a view to reaching an early and amicable solution to this humanitarian problem.
The General Assembly has a full agenda before it at this session. There is a whole array of issues of serious concern to the international community. Many of the issues are not new to us, having been dealt with in this body over the years.
It is my hope that at this forty-fourth session the General Assembly will be able to achieve consensus on many of these issues. It is also my hope that resolutions will not just remain resolutions to be ritually debated aid adopted year in and year out, without contributing to any tangible improvement of the human condition. Let us strive together to galvanize international action towards greater and more fruitful global co-operation. To this end my delegation pledges its fullest co-operation with you, Mr. President, aid with other national delegations in ensuring a successful and productive outcome of our deliberations.
","It remains Malaysia's conviction that only the United Nations can provide the necessary expertise, authority, and resources to ensure the deployment of an impartial and effective international control mechanism within the framework of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia. In hailing this outstanding achievement Malaysia urges the two super-Powers to press ahead with their negotiations for a 50 per cent reduction of their strategic nuclear weapons so as to pave the way for the ultimate elimination of the nuclear threat. My Government also believes that on the priority issue of providing 'negative security assurances' to non-nuclear-weapon States, pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, there should be legally binding undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. The other disarmament issues, my Government believes that given the rapid advances in space technology and the increasing threat of the misuse of outer space, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive regime regulating the use of outer space by the international community. Malaysia is heartened that serious efforts have been undertaken at the United Nations to examine the question of the revitalization of economic growth and development of the developing countries, and to deliberate upon the question of an international development strategy."
44,1989,NPL,"ï»¿
I have the honour to convey to you, Sir and through you to the representatives assembled here, greetings from my august Sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, and his best wishes for the success of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.
I consider it a great privilege to offer to you, on behalf of the delegation of Nepal and on my own behalf, our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The complex issues on our agenda demand the qualities of leadership, diplomatic skill, and experience that you so admirably command. Your unanimous election also attests to the important role that your great com try, Nigeria, continues to play in promoting international understanding, co-operation and peace. My delegation looks forward to working under your guidance for the success of this session.
May I also convey our deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of the Argentine Republic, for the able and exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly.  He more than justified the confidence reposed in him by the international community.
Although the fortunes of the United Nations have not quite turned around, we have come a long way since the challenges of solvency and viability caused a serious crisis only a few years ago. The renewed trust in the Organization as an irreplaceable instrument for regulating international relations and resolving international problems is a remarkable achievement and a lasting tribute to the patient diplomacy of the Secretary-General, Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar. He deserves our gratitude and support.
The present session of the General Assembly meets amidst far-reaching changes taking place on the international scene. Most encouraging is the visible thaw in the situation of cold war. The Secretary-General rightly emphasized in one of his earlier reports that the requisite relationship between the roost powerful States was indispensable to the creation of conditions in which the noble concepts of the Charter could be made to function for the benefit of all. A beginning towards that requisite relationship has apparently been made. With the lowering of East-West tensions, support for the United Nations is coming from powerful sources that have the capacity to make the Organization an effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Indeed, the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, the cease-fire in the Gulf war, the implementation of the plan for the independence of Namibia, and recent developments in Kampuchea and Central America are just a few concrete examples of what the Organization is capable of achieving given the full co-operation of its Members. However, as the prospects for irreversible progress on those a\d other fronts ace at best tenuous, constant vigilance and watchful tending of the Organization are called for.
As the international community prepares for the advent of the twenty-first century, it is heartening to note that the divisive schisms of the past ate being bridged and that many familiar prejudices of yesteryear have crumbled. There is no guarantee, unfortunately, that the dynamics of the international situation, which encourage a return to conducting international affairs in keeping with the principles of the Chatter, ace irreversible. In fact, as we perceive it, the very fluidity of the present world situation could indeed spur a new generation of threats to international peace and security. As super-Power rivalries are being toned down and areas of super-Power confrontation rapidly shrink, we believe there lurks the danger of adventurist forces seeking to fill or exploit the vacuum thus created. It is also our perception that the uncertainties created by the fast-approaching demise of the cold war have greatly enhanced the importance of upholding the fundamental principle of non-intervention.
In that context I wish to recall the sober assessment of the plight of weak and small States presented by His Majesty King Birendra at the recently concluded ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade. His Majesty stated:
'In fact, the small and the weaker nations among us even in our times staid still exposed not merely to under-development but also to threats regarding security and stability. They are susceptible to many forces beyond their control, be it the onslaught of mass communication or the threat of gun-boat diplomacy. While the strong ones can pursue the goals of economic, technological aid military prowess, the weaker and vulnerable countries have to struggle constantly for bare survival. That is why we feel their voices should be heard, their identities maintained and their survival assured'. 
 I may recall here that Nepal has always rejected the primeval concept of 'spheres of influence'. It also resolutely rejects that obsolete doctrine's pernicious corollary that the security of the bigger and stronger States is more important than that of the weaker ones. To accept such a concept would be not only to make a mockery of the Charter principles of the Organization, but also to invite the Armageddon that the world body has sought to prevent, successfully so far. Nepal will therefore support any concerted move by the United Nations to consider seriously practical ways in WHICH the existing mechanisms of the Organization could be used more effectively in meeting the demands created by the exigencies of a thawing but unpredictable international situation. We welcome the initiative of the Maldives to add to the agenda of the General Assembly an item entitled 'Protection and security of small States'. We have studied with great interest its proposal for strengthening the security of small States by, inter alia, devising a mechanism within the United Nations that would be able to respond quickly in the event the security of a small State is threatened.
In this context, I wish to recall the proposal of His Majesty King Birendra that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. I am pleased to announce that this proposal has secured the valuable endorsement of 110 States Members of the Organization, for which I reiterate our deep appreciation. We have long held that Nepal's zone of peace proposal - which is a natural corollary of our policy of scrupulous adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter aid non-alignment - could be a useful addition to the existing corpus of confidence-building measures. We believe that Nepal's proposal will be recognized by the international community as a practical example of how small States may safeguard their security while being permitted to mobilize their total energies aid limited resources for the awesome challenges of development.
The need for the United Nations is demonstrated most palpably when it comes to dealing with problems that transcend national boundaries. The environment, and the growing evidence of global climate change, is one such problem that invites out urgent notice. Nepal has always been an active supporter of initiatives connected with the conservation of man's natural environment aid looks forward to high-level participation at the proposed United Nations Conference on Development and the Environment slated for 1992. 
I should like to take this opportunity to invite the attention of the international community to the special environmental concerns of my land-locked and largely mountainous country. The Nepalese delegation has stressed in the General Assembly year after year, there is an urgent need to address the serious problem of environmental degradation of the Himalayan foothills beginning with an forestation campaign on an appropriate scale to complement our own determined but necessarily limited endeavours. Such a project  we believe  would not only help check the quite unplanned export of an estimated 250 cubic meters of precious topsoil from Nepal to the Bay of Bengal every year but also greatly assist in preventing the tragic annual visitation of deluge  devastation and despair in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains of India and Bangladesh, downstream from Nepal, I should add that such an internationally assisted programme to provide verdant cover to the now largely denuded lower slopes of the Himalayas would also have a most beneficial effect in preserving the traditional climatic pattern of bountiful monsoon rains for three to four months every year that sustains the life of hundreds of millions in our region.
As the first tell-tale signs of climate change and desertification are already beginning to manifest themselves in the Himalayan foothills, along with increasing denudation of forest cover, we believe only a well-planned and adequately funded effort at forestation can prevent drastic changes in climate including in the pattern and quantity of rainfall, that looms so ominously on the horizon.
It is against this worrisome backdrop that I must inform the Assembly that since 23 March this year we have been compelled to put our diminishing forests to the axe. Bereft of fossil fuels of our own and dependent on others for the import of gasoline and petroleum products for meeting our energy needs, Nepal has no other recourse. We have been losing what remains of our once plentiful forests at the alarming rate of 240 hectares per day to meet the demand for firewood. 
Another, more costly option, for putting an end to the process of felling trees for the energy needs of Nepal's rising population is to exploit our abundant water resources for power generation purposes. If adequate in technical assistance were forthcoming, not only would Nepal's demand for such firewood supply be eliminated and imports of petroleum products drastically reduced, but non-polluting energy resources would also be made available for export purposes. I should like to recall the proposal by His Majesty King Birendra in 1977 indicating Nepal's readiness to co-operate with countries in our region for joint ventures to exploit our hydro-resources for the collective welfare of our peoples.
The twin dangers of man-induced climate change and serious environmental degradation of the foothills of the Nepalese Himalayas are inextricably linked, in our case, to Nepal's land-locked geographical condition. While this physical handicap afflicts a score of developing countries, it is not surprising to us that most least developed countries are land-locked. The lack of sovereign access to the sea and its implications, exacerbated by the very remoteness from overseas markets and by the generally poor transit facilities, give rise to crippling freight costs, additional transportation times and additional transport risks. In sum, they can seriously affect their very survival, especially if actions taken by transit countries result in the denial or delay of unrestricted transit of goods and services to such countries. 
It is for this reason that Nepal has always championed the cause of land-locked developing countries in this and other international forums. In particular, Nepal has always advocated the unqualified recognition by the international community of the inherent right of land-locked countries to free access to and from the sea and freedom of transit, as has been recognized by various international instruments, including the United Nations law of the Sea Convention. We shall continue to do so in the future, too, working not only for unfettered transit rights for land-locked countries but also for accords that would make this unfortunate category of sovereign Member States equal beneficiaries of the bounties of the seas, as was eloquently urged here the other day by His Excellency General Andres Rodriguez, President of the Republic of Paraguay-
The twentieth century will be remembered for the colossal loss of human life in conflicts as much as for the material and technological progress achieved. With the available technological and scientific knowledge, the spectre of hunger, poverty and backwardness can be eliminated for all mankind. Yet, as this century of war and technological marvels draws to a close, it is indeed a bitter paradox that for millions of people destitution is the way of life.
Since its inception, the United Nations has recognized the inseparable link between political and economic independence. The development imperatives of the developing countries have become the central issue of our times. Wider acceptance of the global economic interdependence notwithstanding, the strategy for the establishment of a just economic order remains only an expression of pious intention. The debt problem is but one manifestation of a crisis which has deeper political implications. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly next year will prove to be an occasion for a sober assessment of the prevailing situation, thereby providing a basis for the launching of a serious North-South dialogue.
The vagaries of the world economy have, predictably, hit the least developed countries the hardest. The targets set out in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the least Developed Countries have largely remained unfulfilled. Experience gained as a result of the Programme have shown that support measures for these countries cannot be predicated on programmes with short-term bases.	
In addition, the structural adjustment programmes should be compatible with the medium- and long-term development needs of the least developed countries. The second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held next year, offers an opportunity to review the entire situation, and my delegation looks forward to the full co-operation of the international community, which will help in placing those countries on the path of sustained growth and development.
I wish now to turn to some of the important political issues before us.
The implementation of the plan for the independence of Namibia is one of the roost significant and fulfilling operations ever mounted by the United Nations. We commend the determination of the Secretary-General to stand firm and carry out faithfully the mandate entrusted to him. We are especially heartened by his determination to ensure that the voter registration process, the draft electoral laws and the laws relating to the power of the Constituent Assembly are to the satisfaction of the United Nations, so as to enable the Namibian people to participate in free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations, without intimidation, threat or interference.
Nepal is equally committed to the eradication of the universally-condemned system of apartheid in South Africa. We salute the brave freedom fighters of South Africa who have refused to compromise in their struggle for equality and justice and for the establishment of a multiracial democratic society in South Africa. We renew our appeal for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter further to isolate South Africa  and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political detainees, including Nelson Mandela, and the lifting of all restrictions on the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress.
My delegation earnestly hopes that the parties concerned will continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity to bring to a satisfactory end the 14-year-old dispute in Western Sahara.
We are encouraged by the Secretary-General's optimism concerning the prospect for the solution of the Cyprus question. My delegation reiterates its support for the good offices of the Secretary-General in finding a solution that ensures the territorial integrity, independence and non-aligned character of Cyprus.
In the Middle East, the continuing uprising of the Palestinian people in territories occupied by Israel since 1967, despite heavy-handed efforts to suppress it, has underlined the need to intensify efforts for a negotiated settlement that would meet the uncompromising valid needs of the two peoples: national self-determination for the Palestinian people and security foe Israel, lb this end, my delegation reiterates its support for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations.
We are deeply concerned at the recent deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, where a fragile cease-fire is now in place. As a participant in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, Nepal is committed to upholding the unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon. We also support the continuing efforts of the Arab League to bring to an end the tragic fratricide in Lebanon.
The cease-fire in the war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq has brought to an end the heavy toll in human life aid material damage. The region, however, remains tense due to lack of progress in negotiations. I wish to reiterate my delegation's full support for the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General to secure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which remains the only universally accepted basis to secure a just and lasting peace in the region. 
We have welcomed the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in conformity with the Geneva Agreements. Those Agreements constitute an important steps however, agreement among the Afghans themselves is crucial for the settlement of the problem. Faithful adherence to the Geneva Agreements by all parties concerned, together with the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 43/20, will facilitate such dialogue and create conditions for the Afghan people to exercise their right to self-determination and to enable the refugees to return to their homeland in safety, honour and peace.
The Jakarta Informal Meetings have initiated some positive developments with regard to the situation in Kampuchea. While welcoming the decision of Viet Nam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, we wish to emphasize the need for international supervision of such withdrawal as well as for agreement on the establishment of an interim quadripartite authority and on the question of Vietnamese settlers.
We continue to support the aspirations of the Korean people for national unity and reconciliation through direct and peaceful negotiations between the two sides without outside interference. As progress towards that laudable goal continues, regrettably, to be elusive, and in keeping with the principle of the universality of the United Nations, my delegation can support any move for the admission of the two Koreas to the world body, either after reunification, as one State, or, till then, by any State that desires such membership.
We support the agreement reached by the Central American countries recently for the implementation of the goals set out in the Esquipulas II Agreement and the move for the establishment of the international support and verification commission in that regard.
Improved bilateral relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, epitomized by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the INF Treaty, have undoubtedly raised hopes for meaningful progress in  the field of disarmament. Nepal believes that it is crucial to capitalize on what has been achieved to push resolutely foe deep cuts in the strategic arsenals of the two super-Powers. A firm reversal of the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons will have the most salutary impact on efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Together with deep cuts in strategic nuclear arms, the goal of a comprehensive ban on all nuclear-weapon tests needs to be followed resolutely. We have accordingly supported the move to convene a meeting of the parties to the partial test ban Treaty with a view to amending it to cover all nuclear-weapon tests. Efforts for an early conclusion of a comprehensive treaty banning chemical weapons has received fresh impetus from the Paris Conference on chemical weapons, held in January this year. The increasing sophistication of conventional weapons and the growing international transfer of these weapons have added urgency to the need to address the issue of conventional disarmament. We welcome the move towards a major reduction of conventional weapons and forces in Europe, and urge that the goal of conventional disarmament be pursued resolutely at regional and sub regional levels in other parts of the world.
As the Secretary-General has noted in his annual report, the spread of knew-hew, not only in the field of nuclear weapons but also in chemical and missile technology, has introduced a new and potentially destabilizing factor. Unless the international community remains vigilant, such developments may well negate any possible gain made through big-Power disarmament agreements.
It is ironic that, while the political climate in the United Nations continues to improve steadily, the Organization continues to live with a financial crisis. Such a crisis impedes the planning of a credible long-term strategy for peace. The renewed confidence in the world Organization has generated new demands for peace-keeping operations. The planning and launching of those operations have, as the Secretary-General noted in his report, stretched to the limit the human and financial resources of the Organization. The valuable suggestions of the Secretary-General regarding financial and personnel aspects of the Organization deserve serious consideration, in view of the growing role of the United Nations in world affairs today. 
Nepal is deeply concerned about the effect of the escalation in the illicit trafficking of drugs on international social and political stability, particularly in Latin America. We greatly appreciate Colombia's determined battle against this scourge. The fight against the lethal menace of drugs demands a concerted international response. The adoption in December 1988 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is an important step in that direction. My delegation strongly supports the proposal made by His Excellency, Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of Colombia, to hold a special session of the General Assembly to chart a complete plan of action to eradicate the menace of the illicit trafficking and use of drugs.
Terrorism is another grave problem which post-dates the creation of the United Nations but which demands the co-operation of all States in meeting the challenges it poses to international peace and stability. General Assembly resolution 40/61 of 1985 and Security Council resolutions 579 (1985) and 638 (1989) represent the unified stand of the international community on this problem. We must exert every effort to build on this international consensus to strengthen international protection against the scourge of terrorism.
Another important issue on the global agenda concerns the development and protection of children. Nepal strongly supports the proposal of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNIÅP) for a world summit on children next year focusing on the rights and needs of children aid on measures better to ensure their development and protection.
I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to members of the Organization our deep appreciation of the trust and confidence they have placed in us by electing Nepal as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We have tried to live up to this trust to the best of our ability. It has been a particular honour to be on the Council at a time when it has been able to play an important role in establishing a cease-fire in the war between Iran and Iraq aid launch the process of implementing the plan for the independence of Namibia - to name just two important issues on the agenda of the Council.
The commitment of Nepal to the principles and purposes of the United Nations is enshrined in the directive principles of the Constitution of Nepal. The Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries in their recent ninth conference at Belgrade declared that without the United Nations it would not be possible to realize the fullest and broadest possible democratisation of international relations/ which has always been one of the primary objectives of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries. Peace and harmony in the world demand that Member States live up fully to their obligations under the Charter. As in the past, we stand ready to join in any concerted endeavour aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations, convinced as we are that the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations remain the most effective agent to bring about timely, peaceful and meaningful change in promoting development and in restoring faith in the dignity of human persons and of nations. The United Nations was established with the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and better standards of life for all peoples in larger freedom. Today, we have a unique opportunity to begin to translate that vision into reality - a chance to fulfil a 44-yeac-old promise to our peoples - to bring them peace, justice aid a decent standard of living.
I appreciate the President's efforts to find a solution for the inevitable urge of delegations to extend greetings. Because I know there is no other speaker after me, may I be permitted to proceed to my delegation's seat by the shortest route. 
","As the first tell-tale signs of climate change and desertification are already beginning to manifest themselves in the Himalayan foothills, along with increasing denudation of forest cover, we believe only a well-planned and adequately funded effort at forestation can prevent drastic changes in climate including in the pattern and quantity of rainfall, that looms so ominously on the horizon.

Faithful adherence to the Geneva Agreements by all parties concerned, together with the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 43/20, will facilitate such dialogue and create conditions for the Afghan people to exercise their right to self-determination and to enable the refugees to return to their homeland in safety, honour and peace."
44,1989,PRT,"ï»¿
Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. On behalf of my country and of myself personally, I am
Pleased to express our confidence in your ability to undertake the important duties with which you have been entrusted. I also extend to the President of the General Assembly at its previous session, Mr. Dante Caputo, our deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he carried out his difficult tasks.
Furthermore, I would like to give special recognition to the Secretary-General for his untiring activities on behalf of the objectives of the United Nations. Yesterday, my colleague the Foreign Minister of France spoke on behalf of the European Community and carefully enumerated the principal themes to be debated here and the Community's position on these issues. They are positions which my country naturally shares, without prejudice to any particular considerations which arise from our special ties to other countries and continents - ties that constitute an important part of our national identity and that have contributed positively to the positions taken by the Community before the world.
Conscious of its past, Portugal has always involved itself in the great issues that concern not only East-West relations, but those between North and South. All those who, like us, defend the principles of democracy, liberty and human rights must continue to work for an improved climate of solidarity between men and among nations.
In this context, I would mention the proposal presented by the Portuguese Prime Minister at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in May 1988, concerning the creation in Lisbon of a centre for global interdependence and solidarity. Covering diverse areas and themes and with a flexible structure, the centre would play an important role in the exchange of ideas and projects? a place for study and meetings, it should promote a mutual awareness and understanding of problems and experiences between peoples of the North and South.
Portugal's activity in this sector is not limited to the support of such a centre. Through our participation in the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to which we were recently elected, we shall dedicate ourselves fully to the activities of that important organ of the United Nations. History has ensured that an exceptional relationship should exist between Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries, which today include 200 million human beings scattered over the four corners of the glebe. Then will Angola be able to progress on the path of national reconstruction, Progress and development. We have folded with the greatest attention and care the quadripartite discussions that took place throughout 1988. The constructive spirit that prevailed then was to be crowned by success with the signing of the already historic agreements reached in Brazzaville and New York. Portugal is mindful of the historical and cultural relations that bind it to the great Angolan nation. For that reason we hope that the spirit of peace will be fruitful.  The process will be long and difficult, calling for great persistence, tolerance, courage and vision, but the Angolan people surely will know how to sacrifice the unnecessary and combine their efforts so as to make reconciliation a reality. 
For our part, we shall continue to do our utmost to support all the efforts under way. It is pertinent here to salute the mediation efforts of President Mobutu Sese Seko, which will undoubtedly benefit the people of Angola, Africa and the world. Also in Mozambique, efforts are being made to put an end to a situation which has been especially painful for its people and which has taken a heavy human and economic toll, we share the hopes of the Mozambican Government and people that the path to peace and reconstruction will soon be found. It is the people of Mozambique who must decide which path to take. Portugal is following with great interest the efforts undertaken to overcome the differences that separate the Mozambican people as well as the significant contribution made by the churches of that country in the interest of national reconciliation. However, for this solution to become permanent it is essential that all the States in the region, and others that have ties with it, diligently seek all means of useful consensus leading to peace.
We understand, on the other hand, that the resolution of tensions in southern Africa depends, to a large extent, on the posture adopted by the Republic of South Africa. We hope that the paths to regional understanding and dialogue will continue to be explored so that the climate of cooperation necessary for progress and development in southern Africa will be created. The fulfilment of that objective is none the less inseparable from the process of change in South African society, which should lead to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of full democracy on a non-racial basis. 
The international community demands a change in the situation of polarization that exists between the black majority and the white minority, an end to the emergency measures in place since 1985 and the release of political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela. Portugal advocates dialogue, both on the international level and on the internal level, as the means of resolving the problems of this area. We have expressed unequivocally our feeling that certain political, diplomatic or financial pressures, if combined with a careful and persuasive dialogue, could well produce positive results and lead to the desired transformations.
It is in that perspective that my country is following attentively the process which will shortly lead to the independence of Namibia and will participate as an observer in the electoral process. In the interests of reaching a desirable equilibrium and progress in all of southern Africa, we believe it to be fundamentally important that the future State of Namibia be based on stability, tolerance and economic and social progress.
We expect all participants in the process to honour their undertakings. On the other hand, the presence of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in the Territory and the efficient and persevering actions of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar and his two associates will ensure the success of this enterprise. Portugal shares a close relationship with Latin America, deriving from age-long historical and cultural links, particularly those which bind it to the great Portuguese-speaking nation of Brazil.
We have expressed our solidarity with the Latin American nations regarding the consolidation of their democratic institutions. These have fortunately become widespread today, despite adverse circumstances which have affected economic development and political stability.
I should like to stress the importance of in' -national solidarity in resolving the debt problem, a matter which is essential to the stability of Latin America and the progress of its peoples. We must stop draining resources by providing incentives for investment in Latin America, permitting in this way the recovery of economies debilitated by successive years of austerity and sac. ii  imposed on the population. Only in this way will it be possible to avoid the social and political tensions that could well place democratic institutions at risk. Portugal has supported the deepening dialogue with the Rio Group, not only to discuss the problems of debt and international trade, but also to encourage the process of Latin American integration which, as in the case of Western Europe, would constitute a decisive step in the expansion of markets and strengthening of the continent's position in the international scene.
In this process of integration, I cannot fail to hail the efforts that have been made by the Andean Pact nations, particularly in their meeting in Cartagena in May 1989. on the subject of Latin America, may I point out the importance of the San Jose meetings, which have brought together in a common effort aimed at the furtherance of peace and development in Central America, the counties of that region, the Twelve, the Contadora Group and its Support Group.
I believe that the meeting of San Pedro Sula and those which preceded it show, through results already achieved, the primacy of dialogue over confrontation. They are the incontestable reflection of the force behind the ties that unite the Europe of the Twelve and Central America.
It is fitting here to refer to the positive results achieved at the recent Tela Summit, leading to the abandonment of armed struggle in Central America, and to reconciliation of forces and full respect for human rights. Besides, the cessation of external intervention and arms supplies to the region, financial and technical assistance of the type envisaged in the co-operation agreement between the European Community and the States parties to the Treaty on Central American Economic Integration are necessary.
Unfortunately, in Panama a situation persists which does not correspond to the hopes that today exist in Central America regarding the re-establishment of democratic rules and respect for the will of the people. This anomalous situation must end urgently and result in the triumph of law. we are witnessing in Latin America the courageous battle of the Republic of Colombia against the network of drug traffickers. Allow, me to express Portugal's unequivocal solidarity with the authorities of Bogota, which are in the forefront of a battle that concerns us all. The problem of trafficking in and consumption of drugs. which has become a universal scourge, destroying insidiously both developed and developing societies, is a matter which touches the entire international community and must be resolutely and mercilessly fought.
An illegal situation, morally and politically untenable, continues to prevail
in the Non-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor, in spite of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council calling for observance of the fundamental principles - namely, those concerning the right to self-determination of its people - and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on decolonization. 
	In accordance with our consistent policy of seeking, through dialogue and negotiation, to achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement of this issue. Portugal is diligently co-operating, as it has since the very beginning, with the Nation efforts of the Secretary-General regarding the question of East Timor, It is. therefore, in an open and constructive manner that we have been engaged in the talks which, under his auspices, started last May between Indonesia and Portugal, aimed at reaching an agreement on the terms of reference, modalities and timing allowing a visit to the territory by a Portuguese Parliamentary delegation eventually to take place.
Though acknowledging the limited scope of this exercise, we are of the opinion that the resumption of the talks is in Itself a positive fact, and we sincerely hope it will be possible to conclude them successfully. We believe that this will certainly be helpful in creating a good atmosphere for their continuation now on the very political substance of the question. Let me assure members of our continuing readiness to co-operate, in good faith and flexibility, with the Secretary-General in the fulfilment of the mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly.
On the other hand, unfortunately, many reports have been reaching us lately, coming from different quarters, institutions, such as Amnesty International, and individuals, and giving account of a new and serious aggravation of human rights abuses in East Timor, through an intensification of military repression and harassment of the civilian population. It is worth noting, in this regard, that the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the Commission on Human Rights has - after failing to do so last year - very recently adopted a resolution on East Timor which, inter alia, regrets that more arrests, torture and summary executions are alleged to have taken place there since the end of 1988. I appeal to the international community not to remain indifferent to this situation and for an end to be put immediately to every form of human rights violations in East Timor.
Without peace, however, there will be no sound and lasting conditions for a return to normalcy in the Territory. And peace, as demonstrated by the unexpected and stubborn persistence of the fighting there, will not be possible without a settlement that will fully respect the interests of the people of East Timor, the need for which was rightly referred to in the statement made yesterday by Prance on behalf of the 12 States members of the European Community.
May I also call members' attention in this respect to the resolutions recently adopted by the European Parliament and the final communiquÃ© issued by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in November 1988. A very special comment should be made, in this context, regarding the letter addressed by Monsignor Belo, head of the local Catholic Church, to the Secretary-General on 6 February 1989, appealing to him for the East Timorese to be allowed freely to express their will on the political future of the Territory, something they have so far been prevented from doing.
Portugal, needless to say, has no neo-colonialist objectives whatsoever concerning East Timor. We invoke our capacity as administering Power solely with the aim of co-operating with the United Nations in bringing about a still incomplete decolonization process, in the light of the basic criteria and rules of the United Nations and in accordance with our own moral, historical and constitutional imperatives.
In his address yesterday the Foreign Minister of France referred to other grave regional conflicts that unfortunately still persist. The continuation of the conflict in Afghanistan, the fratricide in Cambodia, the continued tension in the Korean peninsula and the serious events that took place in China last spring cannot leave the international community indifferent. I refer here also to the instability that prevails in the Middle East, and I applaud all efforts under way to bring peace to the region, notably those of President Mubarak. Allow me to stress the determination of my country to contribute in every way possible to the resolution of those problems. Unfortunately, it is not only in situations of armed conflict where violations of the most basic principles of human rights are evident.
The calm discussion in this Assembly or in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva of the most egregious violations must be understood as a constructive effort on the part of the international community to correct violations, supporting Governments that indicate their concern in this area, or pointing cut the extreme cases where a flagrant disregard for international obligations exists, international trends in this field are frankly positive, whether with respect to the increasing power of public opinion, or with regard to the co-operation of States with the diverse socio-economic institutions concerned. The progress registered in the course of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a relevant example.
It is in this context that my country views with alarm recent moves to undermine the efficiency of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, under the pretext of assuring a better geographical distribution of membership. Equally negative is the tendency that has recently become evident towards a bloc reaction against criticisms or discussions relating to a State in a specific geographical area or regional group. Such initiatives or reactions surely do not foster greater respect for human rights; all States must be aware of this in acting to support those initiatives.
I renew my appeal that this issue, fundamental to the international community, be the subject of reasoned debate aimed at improving the organs that deal with it, thereby securing greater assistance for the individuals under their protection. 
While recognizing the profound social and cultural differences and the varied circumstances of Member States, I believe that all Governments share a common aspiration to establish conditions conducive to the elimination of the death penalty. Portugal, as the first State to abolish that punishment, in 1867, cannot but support the recent initiative taken by the Federal Republic of Germany vis-Ã -vis the adoption of the Optional Protocol attached to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. We appeal to all states that use this form of punishment but that certainly would prefer that it be discontinued, to enable this Protocol to come into force.
Turning now to the international economic situation, I should like to express my support of the statement made by the Presidency of the European Community. In 1992 the Community will complete an ambitious process of economic integration. I must reaffirm that the objective of such integration is the creation not of an isolated entity, but of a more prosperous Europe, and therefore more open to co-operation with other regions.
Of remarkable importance, at the end of this decade, has been the progress achieved in the multilateral commercial negotiations of the Uruguay Round, which should lead to the widening of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The integration of new areas should, in our view, be harmonious and disciplined and based on rules that assure fair and equal competition, providing specific safeguards in some sector in - for example, textiles and clothing.
It is the task of the responsible officials to contribute usefully towards the consolidation of the world economy's basis in the next century. The political realism that today characterizes international relations, the capacity for dialogue and the opening which has been established between the developed and developing countries will be decisive factors in the setting of realistic goals and the accomplishment of concrete results.
With regard to the problems of the environment, I would begin by affirming that their resolution should not be seen as a priority of the industrialized countries alone. Recognizing that the latter today possess the means to resolve some of the questions for which they bear responsibility, we should see the protection of the environment and the resolution of ecological questions as one of the principal concerns of all humanity.
Only a global policy undertaken by the entire international community can effectively combat the growing deterioration of the ecology. The disappearance of vast areas of forest - namely the Amazon jungle - today endangers the entire terrestrial ecological equilibrium. Portugal believes there is an urgent need to develop adequate solutions, through the mobilization of international resources in co-operation with the efforts of Brazil, Malaysia and other interested States, to put an end to the disturbing deterioration of the tropical forests. The conference on the environment and development, to be held in 1992, must seek to define effective means to confront a situation which can only be considered dramatic.
In this battle, which is of concern to us all, efforts should not be spared to establish sustained models of development that will ensure economic growth without destroying the environment.
Taking as a point of departure these two premises - the universal nature of ecological problems and the need to secure economic growth without damaging the environment - this Organization, whether through its agencies, including the specialized agencies, or in plenary meetings, should urgently confront the need to establish coherent policies aimed at the protection of the environment and the resolution of current  problems. This session of the General Assembly is taking place in a climate marked by significant improvements in the international political situation, particularly in East-West relations, opening up new prospects in the important area of arms control and disarmament.
Since the signing of the intermediate-range nuclear forces Treaty - a treaty that, for the first time in history, was not merely limited to reducing deadly weapons, but aimed at eliminating a vast number of them - there have been increasing signs that further and more decisive steps in this area nay be imminent. It appears that this progress is being accompanied by a general consciousness of the fact that the true mainstays of peace and international security are equilibrium, stability and mutual confidence, as well as respect for the primacy of law and the rights and freedoms of the individual.
In saluting the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union, efforts which have led to the emergence of a new spirit in East-West relations, I must reiterate our profound conviction that all progress in the area of arms control and disarmament must be accompanied by corresponding events in the fundamental area of political and economic democratization and respect for human rights. The resolution of those problems must be accompanied by an increased awareness that the enormous advances of technology must be directed towards the correction of asymmetries that characterize our world today. In conclusion, it is opportune to mention the significant role that we feel has been played by the United Nations peace-keeping operations in this climate of detente. We can thus consider that these operations today constitute one of the greatest successes of our Organization, at least in global terms. Their efficacy must be enhanced, and for this it will be necessary to review their system of functioning. 
My country reiterates - and with satisfaction - its confidence in the United Nations as a privileged multilateral forum for the pursuance of the objectives of development and consolidation of security and universal peace which, after all, are its reason for being.
","In this process of integration, I cannot fail to hail the efforts that have been made by the Andean Pact nations, particularly in their meeting in Cartagena in May 1989. on the subject of Latin America, may I point out the importance of the San Jose meetings, which have brought together in a common effort aimed at the furtherance of peace and development in Central America, the counties of that region, the Twelve, the Contadora Group and its Support Group. And peace, as demonstrated by the unexpected and stubborn persistence of the fighting there, will not be possible without a settlement that will fully respect the interests of the people of East Timor, the need for which was rightly referred to in the statement made yesterday by Prance on behalf of the 12 States members of the European Community.

44,1989,COL,"ï»¿
On behalf of the people and the Government of Colombia please accept our congratulations and good wishes on your election, Sir, as President of the General Assembly. I am sure that you will preside with distinction over the deliberations of this body, which brings together the community of nations. Let me also associate myself with those who have already praised the splendid work done by your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo. In addition, may I pay tribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General, Xavier Perez de Cuellar, towards achieving world peace.
This is the last time I shall address the General Assembly as President of Colombia. However, I am here today not only as President of my country hut also as a citizen of the world. This is the last time I shall address the General Assembly as President of Colombia. However, I am here today not only as President of my country but also as a citizen of the world.
The terrible carnage of the Second World War gave birth to this body in the hope that nations standing together united could prevent the global madness of 50 years ago from ever happening again. Since then, in spite of the persistent efforts of the United Nations, mankind has continued to follow the destructive path of war in conflicts around the planet. Only the unimaginable devastating consequences of nuclear war have restrained us from falling once again into a world-wide conflagration. Yet, in spite of the fragile armed peace thus generated, the world has remained at war. Conflicts generated by ideology, poverty, injustice, excessive ambitions, and new increasingly by narcotics, have scarred the peace.
Respect for national sovereignty underlies all our strategic thinking. Indeed, it is the basis for this United Nations. Yet now we find this newest threat, narcotics, and the accompanying terrorism that pays no respect; to borders. We, the community of nations gathered here, find ourselves under assault from an international criminal enterprise that respects none of our norms of sovereignty, borders or laws.
To meet this new challenge we must, avail ourselves of those core founding values of the United Nations If we cannot act together in the face of this menace, then we will be abetting unrestrained growth in the use of drugs and the violence they generate. I am certain that Colombia will defeat the drug traffickers. But if this effort is not accompanied by a global commitment, then no victory can be achieved.
The recent global outpouring of solidarity and support for Colombia has been a great encouragement to us in these difficult times. A new era is upon us, an era as critical as the one that led to the establishment of the United Nations. A new world war is being waged by an aggressor unrestrained by the traditional rules of engagement or by the responsibilities of national sovereignty. This aggressor is an insidious, global criminal network with enormous power and resources, a criminal enterprise that feeds on the illegal profits from the trafficking of drugs. As the Secretary-General states in his report to the Assembly this year,
'Illicit use and traffic of drugs is now recognized as a social plaque afflicting both developed and developing countries. Although efforts to combat this scourge have intensified in recent years, estimates suggest that the monetary value of drug trafficking has recently surpassed that of international trade in oil and is second only to the arms trade. It is   chastening observation that humanity is so deeply mired in the commerce of degradation and death.' (A/44/1, p. 23)
The members of these criminal cartels were born in many nations, and many of their leaders are called Colombian. But while some may have been born in my country let me be clear: they are Colombian in name alone. They are international fugitives on the run. They have no home. Colombia is not their homeland.
I am here today at the United Nations to lay out the stark realities of this war against drug trafficking. Colombia is on the front line of this battle. For us this is no war of words. In Colombia the casualties of our struggle have been mounting for some time. About one month ago we suffered the tragic assassination of one of our finest national leaders, Luis Carlos Galan. In many ways his death has galvanized our nation and focused the attention of the world on this problem. But our war on drugs has been taking its toll for years. We have lost 12 Supreme Court Justices, an Attorney General and a Minister of Justice. We have lost members of Congress, judges, mayors, scores of journalists, thousands of soldiers and policemen and tens of thousands of Colombian citizens who were committed to the cause of democracy.
Following my announcement last month of drastic measures using executive powers available under a stage of siege, the traffickers in narcotics have continued to engage in a cowardly reign of terror. They have threatened and retaliated against innocent families; they randomly strike at our cities and have bombed institutions such as our newspaper El Espectador that dare to speak out clearly against organized crime. In their aim to protect their illegal activities, the drug traffickers seek to destroy the will of our people and undermine our most precious institutions. Hear me well - they will fail. Colombia, one of the oldest and most stable democracies in Latin America, will prevail and emerge from this new trial stronger yet.
In these past few weeks we have won some important victories. We are methodically breaking the back of the cartels, not just by confiscating and destroying many tons of cocaine Colombian authorities actually capture almost 80 per cent of the cocaine seized in the world. But our offensive goes far beyond that. Those responsible for the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan have already been captured. Thousands of suspects have been apprehended and millions of dollars in property - processing plants, bank accounts, communications equipment, aircraft, boats, houses and ranches - have been seize.'
But all these victories will not be sufficient to win this war. That is why I am here today. Only through concerted international action can we hope to defeat the scourge of narcotics. The drug cartels have declared total war. This declaration of war is against the entire community of nations, against those whose young people are being poisoned by drugs and against those who, like Colombia, see their democracy and their institutions threatened by violence and terrorism. There are no boundaries to the death caused by the narcotics conflict, there are no safe havens from narco-terror - and now, there must be no safe haven, anywhere in the world, for the narco-traffickers. In this war, the time has come for the community of nations to choose sides.
It may be difficult for many here to agree that this is a global wars they may see it as a scourge of this hemisphere alone. Many, in fact, do believe that cocaine is a scourge only of the Americas - produced in South America and consumed in North America. But that is not so, because, even as we meet here today, the tentacles of drug trafficking are reaching into Europe and the Par East. The aggressive search for new markets is no more respectful of oceans than it has been of borders. Wherever there are consumers there will be suppliers. And, indeed, cocaine is only one ugly manifestation of a much wider narcotics crisis. Make no mistake - this scourge touches us all.
In solidarity, as a community of nations, this should be our plan of action. First, we simply must effectively stop the demand for these illicit drugs. It is the insatiable demand for drugs that fuels narco-terrorism and is one of the greatest threats to democracy in Latin America. Those who consume cocaine are contributing to the assassination of my people by the criminal drug cartels. No doubt somebody a few blocks from this Hall, in one of this city's fashionable neighbourhoods, taking his usual dose of cocaine in the civilized calm of his living room, would balk at this description. Yet as surely as if he pulled the trigger he is the slayer of those Colombian judges and policemen who have paid with their lives for trying to uphold the law and democracy.

Every tact and every weapon in the war against narcotics pales into insignificance when compared to the need to reduce demand. The illegal profits produced by drug consumption are simply too great. I am sure that in Colombia we will defeat the drug traffickers, but someone, in some country, somewhere, will supply the drugs as long as the business remains so profitable. This happened in the case of marijuana: when it became too expensive for drug traffickers to operate in Colombia, because of effective law enforcement, they moved to California, Hawaii and other places. The only law that the drug traffickers do not break is the law of supply and demand.
No society, no matter how rich, can afford to have its sons and daughters poisoned by cocaine, heroin, marijuana or any other deadly drug. In this regard, President Bush's national drug control strategy is a first, step in the right direction. We must insist on the message that illegal drugs are neither fashionable nor harmless, whether consumed at the glittering parties of the wealthy or in the ghetto. Drug users need to understand that in this war they are in the camp of the enemy, along with those who produce and push drugs. Let me take this opportunity to say how much I appreciate the initiative and leadership of the Prime Minister of Great Britain in her call for an international conference on the reduction of demand for narcotic drugs. Mrs. Thatcher has honoured me with her invitation, which I have accepted, to address the conference at its opening meeting next April.
Secondly, our efforts to reduce the supply of cocaine also depend on international co-operation in stopping the illegal trade in chemicals which are essential to the processing of this drug. Generally, much attention is given to the production and processing of drugs; for example, too much emphasis has been placed on the cultivation of coca leaf in countries like Peru and Bolivia. Unfortunately, in contrast, little attention is given to controlling the supply of chemicals which are used to process cocaine and which come mainly from North America and Europe. None of them is manufactured in Colombia - all of those chemicals are snuggled into our country. Tightening controls on the manufacture and sale of those chemicals, as well as strengthening sanctions against their illegal shipment, must be one of our highest priorities. It takes more than coca leaf to produce cocaine. Without the needed chemicals there would be no narcotics. Let us exert pressure on the suppliers of those chemicals as firmly as we do on the poor peasant growers of coca leaf.
Thirdly, the weapons used by the drug cartels to intimidate, maim and kill my people are not manufactured in Colombia. They are found on the international arms market where even the most sophisticated weapons are easily and legally bought. Let us make no mistake about this: those who sell arms to the narco-terrorists are even more guilty than the addicts whose demand for drugs fuels violence. Last year Colombia presented a draft resolution calling for restrictions on arms sales, but unfortunately consensus could not be found at the United Nations. We can no longer wait while this deadly trade continues. It is essential to adopt special measures to reduce and control arms sales to drug traffickers and terrorists. I call on all the nations of the world to stop this madness and stop it now.
My Government also views with extreme seriousness the activities of foreign mercenaries in training and assisting narco-terrorists in Colombia. The international community must strengthen its condemnation of the murderous association of mercenaries with terrorists and drug traffickers. My Administration has not only condemned the presence of foreign mercenaries in our territory, it has also criminalized their activities and ordered their capture. These developments in Colombia make an urgent and indisputable case for this Assembly to approve the convention outlawing these criminal activities.
Fourthly, international co-operation is an essential element in efforts to halt money-laundering. The drug cartels depend on the international banking system for the transfer of funds. A significant part of the criminal profits is invested in the industrialized nations - in bank accounts and bonds, in properties and in legal businesses. Somehow our sense of justice is warped when a poor farmer who feeds his family by growing coca is seen as a greater villain than the wealthy international banker who illegally transfers millions of dollars of drug money that finances terrorist actions against innocent people. If the international banking system co-operates, we can in the short term make great progress in the fight against the drug traffickers.
Fifthly, each of us present here must press for the prompt ratification of the Vienna Convention. Painstakingly negotiated for many months, this Convention includes specific action on a wide variety of fronts, from penalties for consumption to seizure of ships on the high seas arid confiscation of properties. Upon my return to Colombia, I shall introduce the Vienna Convention to the Colombian Congress for consideration and study. For this Convention to be effective, it must be ratified and implemented by the entire community of nations.
In addition, I wish to recommend to this Assembly two other multilateral initiatives: the first is to call a special session of this General Assembly addressed to all aspects of the global drug problem - consumption and production - which would consider urgent actions including those I am suggesting today; the second step - and perhaps the most important way of making concrete progress â is to establish an international working group at ministerial level, which would meet periodically to co-ordinate and refine specific anti-narcotics actions and to evaluate progress.
Sixthly, central to political stability and maintenance of Colombia's democratic institutions is the strength of its economy. This is why international co-operation to maintain a strong and stable economy is so vital. In spite of the enormous destabilizing power of drug trafficking, Colombia has been able to remain firm in its will to fight that international criminal organization.
It is critical to note that our economy is not dependent on the income from this illegal drug trade. In Colombia, that money is concentrated in speculative real estate activity and in money laundering. Its contribution to the growth of our economy is marginal. Colombia is not - and will not be - a narco-economy.
Three years ago, I addressed the Assembly on the urgent - need to fight absolute poverty. Since then, my Government has embarked on an ambitious programme of social change aimed at transforming the living conditions of regions traditionally excluded from the benefits of development. The results can already be seen.
In spite of the massive resources that the drug war requires, we will not relent in our pursuit of social change and economic progress. To that end, Colombia requires international and financial co-operation, but even more important is the adoption of commercial and trade measures which allow our economy greater access to markets in the industrialized countries and fair prices for our exports.
The prime example is coffee, the traditional and principal source of income for Colombian farmers. The International Coffee Agreement has recently collapsed, with the result that Colombia will lose more than $400 million this year in income. Sixty-one developing countries stand to lose a total of 35 billion in income next year.
We need the help of the United States and other countries to get the Coffee Agreement signed again. We cannot afford to talk idealistically of crop substitution in the case of the coca leaf while sabotaging Colombian farmers' main cash crop and the country's largest export. It is encouraging to note that President George Bush recently expressed his willingness to co-operate in finding solutions to the problems that led to the rupture of the Coffee Agreement. We expect that all other countries involved understand the seriousness of the situation and the need to revive one of the most successful examples of international economic co-operation.
The weakening of the commodities market only aggravates the debt crisis. Foreign debt is a heavy burden for Latin America and is hindering economic growth. What is even more important, it is worsening the conditions of poverty for millions of Latin Americans. We must work together to find realistic and effective solutions to this vital problem. There is yet another - and related - struggle which has drawn the attention of the world and must be one of our highest priorities in the decade of the 1990s. It is, of course, the destruction of our natural resources and the deterioration of our environment.
As I said recently in Manaos, in the meeting of member countries of the Amazon Co-operation Treaty, the industrialized countries have an ecological debt to all humanity. In less than two centuries, not only have most of the native forests of Europe and North American been razed, but industrial production has brought pollution, acid rain and destruction to the ozone layer. This is an ecological debt to future generations of all the countries of the world who will have to live with the consequences of the mindless way in which the developed countries have handled their natural resources.
The way in which the industrialized nations can pay this debt is by directly contributing to third-world alternatives which preserve the environment, especially the tropical rain forests. I believe that these issues should be dealt with at the highest level of all Governments and of the United Nations. In Colombia we have already made progress in this respect. My Administration has already set aside more than 20 million hectares of rain forest and Indian reserves in the Amazon region, an area much larger than many European countries. Let us pledge to pay this debt for future generations.
If the narcotics problem were not a priority at this moment I would have spoken to the Assembly today about another wars the struggle of the developing countries to eliminate poverty and social injustice. We should not lose sight of these fundamental goals. I would also have spoken in detail about the many important development projects we are promoting, the most important of which for the international community is the proposal to build a land bridge to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through Colombian territory. The railroads, highways and pipelines to be built will provide vital new links for global shipping.
This is indeed a historic moment, and future generations will judge our actions. In this war on drugs there have been many heroes of many nationalities willing to give their lives. Many are well known, but even more are unknown. Luis Carlos Galan died because he dared to speak out. Guillermo Cano, the editor of El Espectador, was gunned down because he would not be silenced. The thousands of soldiers and Colombian citizens who have fallen have died because of their commitment to this struggle. These brave men and women have not died in vain. The entire community of nations must build on their sacrifice to defeat the curse of drugs.
The record of human history is strewn with the wreckage of failed civilizations. We now face a new and global threat. We must act now before it is too late. If we confront the narcotics menace with boldness and determination we can win. With international commitment and co-operation, we can make this plague of the twentieth century obsolete. It is my cherished hope that the school children of the twenty-first century will learn about drugs and about terrorism only from their history books - the history of great plagues that were eradicated.
We should be under no illusion? about the burdens that lie ahead. Victory will take time. Winston Churchill might have been describing the road before us today when he told the House of Commons in 1940: 'Death and sorrow will be the companions of our journey, hardships our garment, constancy and valour our only shield. We must be united; we must be undaunted'.
Let us declare today that together we shall use the last decade of this century to bury the international scourge of drugs, 'together we can and must succeed.
","Following my announcement last month of drastic measures using executive powers available under a stage of siege, the traffickers in narcotics have continued to engage in a cowardly reign of terror. In addition, I wish to recommend to this Assembly two other multilateral initiatives: the first is to call a special session of this General Assembly addressed to all aspects of the global drug problem - consumption and production - which would consider urgent actions including those I am suggesting today; the second step - and perhaps the most important way of making concrete progress â is to establish an international working group at ministerial level, which would meet periodically to co-ordinate and refine specific anti-narcotics actions and to evaluate progress. Since then, my Government has embarked on an ambitious programme of social change aimed at transforming the living conditions of regions traditionally excluded from the benefits of development. If the narcotics problem were not a priority at this moment I would have spoken to the Assembly today about another wars the struggle of the developing countries to eliminate poverty and social injustice. I would also have spoken in detail about the many important development projects we are promoting, the most important of which for the international community is the proposal to build a land bridge to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through Colombian territory."
44,1989,BLR,"ï»¿Please accept, Sir, the congratulations of the delectation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are most appreciative of the activities of the Secretary-General and share the view he expressed in the report on the work of the Organization that:
âThe United Nations needs to demonstrate its capacity to function as guardian of the world's security., (A/44/1, p. 11).
The United Nations emerged from the Second World War which was unleashed by fascism and militarism, which took advantage of the lack of unity among peace-loving forces and of the negative response of the European nations to the Soviet proposals for collective action against the aggressor. Our people took UP arms to defend the goals and principles of international relations which were later enshrined, with our participation, in the United Nations Charter. The members of the anti-Hitler coalition were fighting not only for their national interests, but also to bring freedom and independence to so many enslaved nations. We welcome the statements made during the general debate about the inviolability of cost-war borders in Europe.
Fundamental changes have taken place in the world represented in the United Nations. These changes are most profound and radical and signify the end of the cold war and the dawning of an era of peace and mutual trust, the renunciation of propagandist, polemics and the initiation of a quest for specific bilateral and multilateral action to resolve existing problems by political means, drawing upon the prestige and potential of the United Nations.
Clearly, the most important feature of these multi faceted features is the fact that they are not confined to narrow national interests of individual States. They are global in scale and thus call for a multilateral approach. Not only are these changes encouraging but they also call for a correct understanding of where they are leading the world. In conditions of freedom of choice and of pluralism of opinions based on the new political thinking, these changes also mean that we must further outline joint measures to achieve demilitarisation, democratization and the humanization of international contacts and to establish the primacy of law in relations among States.
Over the past few years, we have all had a difficult oath to tread. Gone are the days when people saw everything in terms of black and whites when everyone believed that he alone was right; when socialism was made out to be the enemy rather than a partner in world affairs; when suspicion and mistrust repelled mutual tolerance and the natural desire of nations to live in peace and friendship with one another; when some would put forward proposals to strengthen peace and develop co-operation while others would reject them; and without even attempting to understand them; when universal human values were not taken into account. Without wishing to continue this review of an unhappy past, for which there are still those who remain nostalgic even today, I would point out that in our detailed, often heated and at times disrespectful, discussions, we, after all, did succeed in restoring and enriching, in United Nations resolutions and recommendations, the meaning of such key notions as international peace and security, disarmament, economic development, co-operation, decolonization, social justice, human rights and so forth.
But it is too early to rest on our laurels. All this should be embodied in mandatory international legal instruments. In this context the next decade, which  will mark the end of the twentieth century and of the second millennium, will be decisive in terms of whether mankind succeeds in coping with new challenges and whether it will emerge victorious in the struggle for peace and well-being for everyone on this planet.
We are preoccupied with the problems of eliminating the threat of war, bringing about disarmament, resolving regional conflicts, eliminating the vestiges of colonialism, ensuring development, social progress, observance of human rights, and the preservation of an ecological balance. It is being increasingly recognized that these problems have a direct bearing on the level of security and the quality of life of the peoples of the world.
It would appear that today everyone understands that the use of military force, particularly nuclear force, with all its devastating consequences, has run its course. It is also clear that there can be no just settlement of regional conflicts through the use of military force. The new level of this understanding has led to important conceptual breakthroughs that have made it possible to conclude and implement the first ever agreement on the actual elimination of a portion of nuclear arsenals of Soviet and United States medium- and shorter-range missiles. It has also made possible the holding of substantive talks on a 50 per cent reduction in United States and Soviet strategic offensive weapons. The initiation of the Vienna Talks on reductions in armed forces and armaments in Europe is an important milestone in modern history. What is important in this regard is that these endeavours are being conducted in a multilateral regional context.
Today it is important to make the current positive developments irreversible. It is essential, not only strictly to comply with agreements readied or to conduct negotiations in a spirit of good will with regard for each, others interests, but also not to take steps in a spirit and direction contrary to those developments, not to try to circumvent existing agreements on the elimination of weapons on the pretext of ,modernizing, or by building up arms in other categories, and not to erect new, artificial barriers when parties to an agreement have already removed earlier stumbling-blocks.
Steps must be taken to solve fundamental problems, namely, fundamental military concepts. The idea of nuclear deterrence is a blood clot in the artery of nuclear disarmament. Wanting to keep nuclear weapons is like being high on drugs. Like drugs that merely give the illusion of happiness while actually ruining one's health, nuclear weapons offer only the Illusion of security while in actual fact they threaten universal annihilation.
Trust, predictability, multilateral agreement on the part of all nuclear powers on measures to reduce the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war, reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their verifiable elimination must replace the policy of nuclear intimidation and so-called deterrence. What the world needs is political and legal deterrence rather than nuclear deterrence.
Generally speaking, there are serious signs of mutual accommodation on the part of various groups of States in the field of disarmament. This is in large part a direct result of the new political thinking. We welcome the recent Soviet and United States agreements and the latest initiatives of the Soviet Union as set forth in the statement by Eduard Shevardnadze, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. While a number of differences exist, definite progress towards a broad consensus on disarmament issues can be perceived in the United Nations also. 
In considering disarmament problems in the United Nations it would clearly be helpful to focus on those areas In which the United Nations, as a unique multilateral forum, possesses appropriate practical capabilities. That could include measures to prevent nuclear war. In particular, it would be advisable to start work on the practical implementation of the proposals, including those of the Secretary-General, to establish a multilateral nuclear and military risk reduction centre and, ultimately, a system of centres that would include regional centres, and the setting up of hot lines between the capitals of all nuclear Powers.
The United Nations has the unique potential in yet another important field, that of the n on-proliferation of dangerous types of weapons, whether nuclear or chemical, or missile technology, as well as in the area of banning the development and production oÂ£ new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.
Work must soon begin at the multilateral level on defensive doctrines and the corresponding structures of armed forces, as well as on the principle of reasonable sufficiency for defence. This is really the right time for it. The imperative need for such doctrines, structures and principles is recognized today by virtually all, and, indeed, a number of socialist States have already taken major strides in that direction. Now it is important to negotiate uniform understanding of their essence, criteria and parameters. An appropriate means of starting such a discussion could be negotiated at the General Assembly.
Current and forthcoming disarmament processes, including efforts to prevent the extension of the arms race to outer space, as well as harsh economic realities have made a practical issue out of one that until recently might have appeared to be merely theoretical - namely, the issue of the conversion of military industries. In this connection, too, multilateral endeavours would be helpful, such as the preparation and presentation of national conversion plans and other related measures provided for in the Programme of Action of the Conference on Disarmament and Development, with an exchange of experience and theoretical studies designed to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs and inconveniences involved in the transition from an arms economy to a disarmament economy.
The Byelorussian SSR has accumulated certain experience in this area. For a long time new our heavy industries, including our defence industries, have been turning out consumer goods with the idea of generating production equal in value to be paid in salaries and wages. Thus military might is gradually ceasing to be the guarantee of security in our diverse, changing and interdependent world. It is being replaced by the concept of a comprehensive approach to the problems of international peace and security in all areas of relations among States. In this connection, the United Nations should become a centre for a system of universal and equal security for all. To that end new approaches are needed to bring about and maintain peace. Most useful principles in this respect are contained in the Charter. They should be used to the full. To that end what is necessary is both a drastic overhaul and long-term fundamental work on improving certain existing machinery that is either idling or has become rusty from infrequent use.
The role of the United Nations in resolving regional crises is growing. This is a field in which United Nations machinery has recently achieved major success and made significant progress towards creating new confidence between States in the potential of multilateral diplomacy, which in turn has justified talk of a kind of United Nations renaissance. Although the ultimate goals have not yet been achieved, in this context one can cite Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq and Namibia  efforts on the problems of the Middle East, South-East Asia, Central America, Cyprus and Western Sahara; and the beginning of dialogue, initiated by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on a settlement in the Korean peninsula.
The United Nations peace-making role should be further developed in the years to come. We should move from extinguishing fires to detecting and preventing them. In other words, we must gather and analyse information on regions of conflict, send missions to the field, set up observation posts, prepare recommendations to parties to conflicts, and where necessary conduct operations to prevent military, political, economic, ecological, humanitarian or other conflicts. All this means that we must make the work of the Security Council more productive. There must be meetings at the ministerial level, and the Secretary-General must be more persistent in raising questions. In other words# we are in favour of a transition from crisis diplomacy to preventive diplomacy that will make it clear to everyone that there is no need to jump into the fire to understand that it will be painful.
It is time to establish the true primacy of law in international relations. This means unconditional compliance with the Charter and obligations under other legal instruments. Furthermore, multilateral legal institutions, primarily the International Court of Justice, should start working to full capacity, and to that end all States in turn should assume new obligations vis-Ã -vis the decisions of such organs. In this connection, I should like to inform the General Assembly that this year the Byelorussian SSR has accepted the compulsory and binding jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice with regard to six human rights conventions and has ratified additional protocols to the Geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts.
New developments and trends in national and world economies have recently been clearly taking shape. Major structural changes are under way. The unipolar pattern has given way to the multipolar system of economic centres. Greater integration of socialist States into the world economy is also changing the picture. The devastating debt burden of the developing countries, the chronic instability of raw-material prices and the poverty of millions all call for our closest attention. The issues of underdevelopment and migration are also growing from a humanitarian-assistance problem into something entirely different: they are becoming a category of universal security. The problems themselves are not new, but it is their magnitude today that gives them a new dimension, which calls for a fundamentally different response. It would appear that it is no longer acceptable to tolerate a situation where the rich grow richer at the expense of the poor, and where discrimination, or even diktat, continues to hold its position in international economic relations. Such a situation has become a threat to global security.
Finally, the gap between actual developments in the world economy and the legal regulation of that economy is becoming ever more striking. It has even been sand that the economy is not subordinate to international law, and that, regrettably, can become the case if we all fail jointly to alleviate the situation in this field.
The Byelorussian SSR has an interest in this work since, from 1990, we shall be switching over to a new economic environment based on self-management and self-financing, in addition to developing and deepening our trade and economic ties with foreign States and firms. In this connection, I should like to stress that as a result of the years of socialist construction the Byelorussian SSR has become a highly developed and agrarian State that provides its people with modern material and other benefits. That has occurred in spite of the fact that during the Second World War we lost half of our national wealth and a quarter of our population  in spite of the mistakes and aberrations of the past. All this proves the enormous potential inherent in the socialist social system and the fraternal Interaction of the peoples of the USSR.
Perestroika and democratization of all aspects of social life new under way in our country will make possible the actual utilization  for the benefit of peoples and individuals   of the enormous potential inherent in socialist production relations.
The problem of universal security is aggravated by new environmental threats* pollution of the atmosphere and water  the greenhouse effect  depletion of the ozone layer  deforestation and desertification. Today all this calls for an urgent review of many traditional views of the balance between the interests of individual States and those of the community of nations. What we need is international multilateral research into these problems. It would appear that the solution should be sought in the advent of energy-saving and resource-saving  environmentally clean technologies and production which generate no waste  and in switching over to renewable resources. In this connection  the pooling of our multilateral efforts is indispensable. The forthcoming conference on the environment provides us with an appropriate opportunity to do that.
To the Byelorussian SSR, environmental issues have a specific feature of their own because of the need for clean-up operations following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear-power station. Immediately following the disaster we had to resettle almost 25f000 people from the contaminated area to other parts of the Republic and build for them 10,000 apartments with the necessary infrastructure. Today the territory contaminated at various levels with radio-nucleides exceeds 18 per cent of all arable land. Costs and losses resulting from setting up , no-go, zones and from resettlement have already reached about 2 billion roubles. We are planning for further evacuation of local residents from contaminated areas, h comprehensive 16-biIion-rouble programme is now being developed in our Republic for 1990 to 1995 to alleviate the consequences of the accident and provide foe safe living conditions in the affected areas. Our own efforts to that end are being backed by the substantial assistance we are receiving from other fraternal peoples of the Soviet Union. A number of public organizations in our Republic have appealed for help to our fellow countrymen and all people of good will abroad. A translation of the text of that appeal is annexed to the text of my statement that has been distributed to members.
We support the United Nations efforts to protect the environment, and also the proposal for the establishment of a centre for urgent environmental assistance and the drawing up of a United Nations programme to mitigate natural disasters and prevent industrial accidents - that is to say  international co-operation in that field, making use among other things of environment-monitoring satellites. In overview, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) should be actively involved in this effort.
We must all give the highest priority to the analysis of problems and phenomena that are emerging in the world today - that is, we must recognize the fundamental nature of those changes, identify new global problems, and define new areas for working together and reaching agreement on ways to bring about urgently needed adjustments in out practical actions.
Taking into account existing differences of opinion on some global processes, we believe that it is not at all necessary immediately to adopt a single consensus view of the future in order to realize that ultimately it will be wise to prepare for imminent change well in advance. 
Obviously, the United Nations itself must change in resonance to new challenges and difficulties. It cannot serve merely as a repository of unrealised ideas. It should rather become a generator of new ideas and blaze the trail of change. It is particularly important new for organs of the United Nations system to fulfil their function as a genuine collective intellect and a centre for harmonizing the actions of States.
President Gorbachev made a tangible contribution to a better understanding of the new role of the United Nations in his speech to the General Assembly last December, by offering a philosophic rationale for the heightened importance of the internationalisation of efforts by States to ensure their common future in a global home, regardless of their special features, ideologies or socio-political systems.
The United Nations has already proved capable of adapting to new conditions. In the current situation it is important not to fragment United Nations political, intellectual and financial resources, but to concentrate them on main problem areas, particularly those where this universal Organization has a particular vantage point, expertise and the ability to formulate global tasks and build consensus on the basis of a balance of interests and realism, so as to perform those tasks in the interests of universal security and co-operation.
At the same time, we must all embark on a course of scrupulous compliance with the binding decisions of the Security Council and, in our practical policies, take into account consensus recommendations, while constantly seeking to expand their scope. It would seem the time has come also to give thought to resolving a situation where one or two delegations obstruct general agreement. In this context, some important further steps could be taken, such as practical measures to endow the United Nations with a preventive function, establishing a crisis early warning system, conferring upon the Organization powers to verify compliance with  multilateral agreements and enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations principal organs, including the Secretariat.
The new role of the United Nations would be best served if we eliminated duplication of work and strengthened the co-ordination of activities of United Nations specialised agencies in accomplishing global, economic, scientific-technological and social tasks. It would also be useful to develop machinery for United Nations interaction with regional intergovernmental bodies and international non-governmental organizations that deal with problems of universal concern, and also with national public organizations.
The United Nations Association that has been created in the Byelorussian SSR intends to be actively involved in the efforts of the world community to translate into reality the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
Attaching paramount importance to the activities within the United Nations framework and to the further development of the World Campaign for Disarmament, we intend to make a regular voluntary contribution to that Fund.
The general debate now drawing to a close and the documents adapted at the ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the non-Aligned countries demonstrate that virtually all United Nations Member States recognize the need for new approaches to the problems of mankind. We are convinced that the United Nations has an important role to play in promoting that vision. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR is prepared to make its own contribution to the discussion of relevant agenda items so that at this very session we may achieve good results which match the imperatives of our time.
","These changes are most profound and radical and signify the end of the cold war and the dawning of an era of peace and mutual trust, the renunciation of propagandist, polemics and the initiation of a quest for specific bilateral and multilateral action to resolve existing problems by political means, drawing upon the prestige and potential of the United Nations.

44,1989,MAR,"ï»¿ At the outset. Sit, let me, on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, extend to you most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. I am convinced that your experience and the many different responsible posts you have held represent the best possible guarantee for the successful completion of our work. Through your election the Assembly has paid a special tribute-to Nigeria, a brother country with which Morocco maintains very friendly ties.
I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor for the wisdom with which he guided the work of the forty-third session. Let me also take this opportunity to express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of our Organization, our sincere thanks for the efforts he has made towards reducing tensions and strengthening peace and security throughout the world. 
The current situation across the globe calls for Å to stop and think. Indeed, out world is on the threshold of a new, more promising era, one in which dialogue and understanding would appear to prevail over confrontation.
Within this framework, out Organization, which has come of age, remains an irreplaceable instrument for leading the international community to greater harmony and justice between nations.
It is gratifying that the consolidation of peace is gradually gaining ground nowadays. The conclusion, in December 1987, of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the beginning of negotiations between the two super-Powers to reduce the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons, and the resumption of negotiations to prohibit underground nuclear testing have, in this connection, marked a decisive turning-point. The latest developments announced last week before the General Assembly by President Bush and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR confirm this trend. None the less the fact remains that the progress made falls short of the progress the international community would wish to see take place in so fat as disarmament is concerned. On the other hand, beyond the danger threatening mankind in terms of the existence of enormous means of destruction one must never cease to remind oneself that resources, no less enormous, that are wasted on excessive armament, could certainly be better invested in helping much of humanity to emerge from want and misery.
Morocco has taken cognisance, with full interest, of the proposals made and initiatives launched by various European countries in the context of reducing arms across Europe and the establishment of a climate of confidence among States of that continent, which continues to be the theatre of operation of the two major military alliances, even its special position reflecting its geo-political situation, Morocco cannot remain indifferent to all that affects peace and security in the Mediterranean, inasmuch as peace in that region is closely linked with peace all over the European continent, as has been emphasized in the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly as well as in the successive declarations issued by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.
Given this fact, the Kingdom of Morocco hopes to see concrete steps taken in the near future in the field of disarmament to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace, security and co-operation, free from any disputes and confrontations.
We likewise hope that this detente will spur progress at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and enable it to overcome its present period of stagnation and thereby make it possible for productive negotiations to be held with a view to arriving at those agreements we are impatiently awaiting, including an agreement to ban chemical weapons.
We should have liked to have seen the region of the Middle East benefit in turn from the encouraging climate of detente now evident in international relations in all parts of the world. But we must note that the intransigence shown by Israel and its blocking of all serious initiatives launched by the Arab side, compel us to give up all grounds for optimism.
As the General Assembly will recall the Arab States at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held at Fez in 1982, adopted a comprehensive Peace Plan, which was received favourably by the international community. The peaceful solution of the problem has been consecrated by the attitude adopted by the Palestine National Council in last November as well as the statements made by the President of the State of Palestine last December before the General Assembly meeting in Geneva.
That peaceful approach enjoyed the backing and encouragement of the entire international community. 
At the Arab summit held last May in Casablanca to which Morocco played host, the Arab States reaffirmed their adherence to a political solution. They recalled that any settlement roust be based on: Israel's total withdrawal from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967, including first and foremost the Arab Al-Quds} the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people, including their right to return to their homeland, self-determination, and the establishment  of their own independent State in Palestine; and the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all parties to the conflict including the representatives of the State of Palestine, on an equal and independent footing in order to achieve a comprehensive and just solution of the conflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) end all the other pertinent United Nations resolutions, as well as the restoration of the national inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and granting security guarantees to all countries of the region, including the State of Palestine.
The summit also decided to support the Palestinian position on the question of the elections so that they could take place after the Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories under international control and within the context of a comprehensive peace.
The fact that the intifadah has been going on for almost two years now notwithstanding all the repressive end terrorist means employed by Israel, has highlighted the desperate struggle of the Palestinian people to spare no sacrifice to regain their dignity end defend their homeland.
The time has come for Israel to put an end to its intransigent policy and to respond to the repeated appeals being launched by the international community in favour of holding a peace conference. Morocco firmly believes that the path of dialogue is the only one that can establish peace in that part of the world.
Lebanon, whose very name until recently was synonymous with tolerance and coexistence, is living today an indescribable tragedy. Morocco, which has so many close ties with that brother country, cannot remain indifferent to the tragedy of the Lebanese people. As part of the efforts being constantly made by the Arab States to resolve the Lebanese crisis the last summit meeting at Casablanca decided to establish a tripartite committee composed of His Majesty King Hassan IÃ, the Guardian of the Holy Places, His Majesty King Fahd Ben Abdul-Aziz, and His Excellency, President Chadli Bendjedid. The committee has been striving to put an end to hostilities and to lay the foundations for national reconciliation, lb that end it has been able to put forward a plan aimed at bringing about an immediate cease-fire and making possible a propitious climate of security that would make possible the adoption of the measures necessary to restore constitutional institutions to Lebanon.
The Tripartite Committee has succeeded in establishing a cease-fire, and the resulting security committee that emanated from it has worked to ensure that the cease-fire is respected. The positive positions taken by the parties concerned at the meeting of the Lebanese Parliament provide grounds for optimism. We hope the parties will be able to bring about constitutional reform on the basis of the draft document submitted by the Tripartite CommitteeÂ·, reform that would take account of economic political and social developments in the com try.
The international community is duty-bound to help Lebanon overcome its ordeal and reach national reconciliation. It must also support legality in Lebanon, based on concord, and consolidate efforts by the State of Lebanon to put an end to Israeli occupation and exercise full sovereignty over all Lebanese territory with a view to protecting its security and stability on its own, as stipulated by the Casablanca Summit Conference.
Morocco is satisfied that the cease-fire between two brother countries, Iraq and Iran, has held, under the terms of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We sincerely hope that the provisions of that resolution will be implemented fully in the near future, and that lasting peace between the two countries will be achieved  
While Morocco hailed the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, it cannot but regret that the war drags on. We hope that Afghanistan will regain full sovereignty, its non-aligned status and its freedom to make the political and economic choices it deems necessary for its development, without foreign intervention or pressure.
With respect to the Cambodian question, we hope that peace efforts by all parties of goodwill will continue. In that respect, we welcome the Paris Conference, which enabled all the patties to join in dialogue with a view to finding a just and lasting solution to the problem that would guarantee the withdrawal of foreign forces and give the Cambodian people the opportunity to take charge of its own affairs.
With the same interest, we follow events, in Cyprus and hail the efforts of the Secretary-General, which aim at ensuring that the dialogue continues between the two communities that make up that non-aligned country and that peace be established within the framework of its territorial integrity and on the basis of respect for the interests of both its communities.
The countries of Central America whose efforts resulted in the Tela agreement, are worthy of all our encouragement and support. We sincerely hope that this agreement will be implemented and that the peoples of the region will finally emerge from the cycle of despair and regain peace arid stability.
The southern half of the African continent is on the threshold of a historic event for which it has ceaselessly striven. The strenuous efforts made everywhere and, in particular, the enormous sacrifices endured by the Namibian people have at last begin to bear fruit. We are thus witnessing the crumbling of the last Bastion of colonialism in Africa, with the 1 April 1989 commencement of the process envisaged by the peace plan for the independence of Namibia set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). I am sure difficulties may surface, but we remain convinced that the path leading the heroic Namibian people to freedom and independence cannot be blocked. Given the wisdom and determination of the Secretary-General, we are certain that the Namibian independence process will proceed in accordance with the wishes of all peace-loving peoples.
Mr. Sam Nujoma's recent visit to Morocco and his meeting with His Majesty King Hassan II reflect again the steadfast support my country has always lent the Namibian people and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), as well as our desire to establish ties of constructive co-operation with a free and independent Namibia. Equally, Morocco cannot but voice its gratification over the climate of reconciliation that is beginning to emerge in Angola. We hope that the efforts that led to the Gbadolite meeting in Zaire will continue until all Angolans can live in peace and harmony. For its part, Morocco will remain faithful to its commitment to contribute to all endeavours to secure the unity of the Angolan people and enable them to devote themselves exclusively to achieving development and prosperity.
The deteriorating situation in South Africa continues to be of concern to the international community because of its grave and negative effect on the elite of detente that is beginning to emerge in the region. Morocco remains convinced that the international community, as it followed with anxiety the developments in South Africa over the past few weeks, should remain vigilant until the disappearance of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic regime respectful of human dignity and fundamental rights.
Since the last session of the General Assembly our region has made major strides towards the long-cherished goal of peace. Our peoples have constantly been aware of belonging to one linguistic and religious community and of sharing the same cultural values.
The establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union, therefore, is an imperative, given the nature of the economic and social problems which face our countries, and whose solution requires joint efforts in a regional framework - the more so since current world trends point in the direction of regional integration as a means of standing up to the many challenges we face and as a necessary element for peace, harmony and stability 
The efforts begun by the five Maghreb Heads of State at their first summit meeting, held at Zeralda, were crowned with the signing, on 17 February 1989 at Marrakech of the Treaty establishing the Arab Maghreb Union comprising Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Tunisia and Morocco. The Treaty is intended to strengthen the fraternal ties that unite the States members of (the Union and their peoples, and to achieve progress and prosperity for their respective societies, along with the defence of their rights. It is intended also to contribute to preserving a peace based on justice and equity. 'To that end, the Arab Maghreb Union will pursue a joint policy in various spheres and strive gradually to bring about among our countries free circulation of goods, persons and capital, in conformity with the programme of action adopted by the Heads of State.
Since the Treaty establishing the Arab Maghreb Union was signed, sustained efforts have been in full swing with a view to developing the Maghreb Integration to the fullest, and making it a reality In every sphere. That Is why hand In hand with the establishment of the Union's institutional bodies we have been working to implement the programme of action.
As regards the Union's relations with other regional groups, we declare our determination to strengths ties of co-operation and co-ordination with the Arab Co-operation Council and the Gulf Co-operation Council, on the basis of the common values and purposes that unite us. We also declare our determination to strengthen our co-operation with other economic groupings of our continent, as that is the best way towards broader regional integration. 
The same strong determination prompts us to establish effective co-operation with the European Economic Community (EEC), which is moving towards having a single market. The setting up of the Arab Maghreb Union will, of course, facilitate co-operation between the two communities and lead to a more fruitful dialogue that is compatible with the strong economic ties existing between them. We also look forward to establishing economic co-operation with the Council foe Mutual Economic Assistance (CMBA) and other regional groups.
Starting from its oft-reiterated commitment to see the problem of the so-called Western Sahara resolved by the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the United Nations, Morocco agreed in principle on 30 August 1988 to the Secretary-General's peace plan.
Pursuing his efforts to implement that plan, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar visited our region last June to hold talks with the various parties concerned. As a result of that visit the Secretary-General set up a technical commission which he entrusted with working out the arrangements of implementing the plan.
For its part, Morocco will continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General as well as those of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Although the international situation has become relatively more relaxed, the world's economic situation offers not the least glimmer of hope. Political stability will remain fragile so long as it is not accompanied by economic improvements and especially if development continues to be the prerogative of the North.
The problems of the South have worsened: to the deterioration in the terms of trade  the rising tide of protectionism, the fall in commodity prices and the fall in the net-flow of resources from abroad we must add the spectre of debt that undermines all the efforts of the developing countries.



In the long run, the widening of the gap between North and South can also have negative effects on the economies of the developed countries themselves. Hence out collective responsibility to face up to the problems of underdevelopment that beset the countries of the South. (our duty is to spare no effort in rescuing the numerous developing com tri is trapped in this tragic situation.
It is well known today mote than ever before, that it is no longer enough to adapt stop-gap measures with regard to the present order. What we need is a thorough re-examination that will enable us to restructure the world economy, taking into account the interests of both sides within a framework of sincere co-operation.
In that connection, the Ministerial Conference of the Group of 77 that was held in Caracas this year responsibly drew up a list of priorities and launched an appeal for a genuine dialogue between North and South that will serve the interests of the international community as a whole.
We are hopeful that the special session of the General Assembly on development questions planned for next year will not be a missed opportunity and that it will enable us to pool our efforts in order to adopt concrete measures that will lead to more balanced international economic relations.
Although we consider North-South co-operation to be a vital factor for world economic balance, we also feel that South-South co-operation is an indispensable factor. In addition to the fact that such co-operation gives concrete meaning to the concept of solidarity among countries, it also enables them to benefit fully from the complementarity of their resources and from their diverse individual potentials.
Morocco has made such co-operation with the developing countries a pivotal concept in its external relations. Indeed, we believe that South-South co-operation can be an important factor in restoring balance to world economic relations.
Morocco's increasing co-operation with fraternal countries on the African continent is the best example of our faith in South-South co-operation  d of our desire to translate that faith into a concrete reality. Thus, our country acted as host last March to the first ministerial conference on co-operation in marine resources held by the coastal African States on the Atlantic seaboard.
The conference examined the potential of co-operation, which could benefit all the countries concerned, without overlooking the interests of the land-locked African countries. It is a living example of South-South co-operation and a clear illustration of what our countries can accomplish in such vital areas.
The deterioration of the environment has become a world-wide concern. Indeed, desertification, the damaging effects of acid rain, the accumulation of dumped toxic substances and the increase in the release of carbonic gases now diffused in the atmosphere have further compounded the development problems with which two thirds of mankind ate already grappling. Such a situation calls for effective international co-operation to adopt the necessary measures. For that reason, the World Climate Conference scheduled for next year and the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development scheduled for 1992 must be carefully planned.
In that connection, Morocco, which took the initiative with other States to make the Organization aware of the problem of natural disasters, is especially pleased to see the International Decade for the Reduction of Natural Disasters beginning next year.
The scourge of drugs is another phenomenon that requires the mobilization of the entire international community, particularly since recent tragic events in Colombia have shown the extent to which drug-traffickers will go. International co-operation is indispensable if we are to meet this new challenge. On the threshold of the third millennium, the world is undergoing a profound structural change - ideological and political, economic and social, scientific and technological. The problems it is facing - whether they relate to the debt crisis, environmental degradation, or the struggle against drugs - will henceforth have to be tackled on a global scale. International solidarity has indeed become an imperative. It must prompt us to work more closely together in managing world affairs. We have the machinery to achieve that goal - the United Nations. It is our duty - especially since we are all aware of the positive role the Organization is playing - to strengthen it and to give it the means to assume those new responsibilities we wish to confer upon it, so that peace and prosperity may reign throughout the world.
In conclusion, I wish the President the fullest measure of success in his work, and hope that we shall indeed make greater strides towards our goals, the essential aspirations shared by all mankind.

","Morocco has taken cognisance, with full interest, of the proposals made and initiatives launched by various European countries in the context of reducing arms across Europe and the establishment of a climate of confidence among States of that continent, which continues to be the theatre of operation of the two major military alliances, even its special position reflecting its geo-political situation, Morocco cannot remain indifferent to all that affects peace and security in the Mediterranean, inasmuch as peace in that region is closely linked with peace all over the European continent, as has been emphasized in the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly as well as in the successive declarations issued by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. With the same interest, we follow events, in Cyprus and hail the efforts of the Secretary-General, which aim at ensuring that the dialogue continues between the two communities that make up that non-aligned country and that peace be established within the framework of its territorial integrity and on the basis of respect for the interests of both its communities. The establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union, therefore, is an imperative, given the nature of the economic and social problems which face our countries, and whose solution requires joint efforts in a regional framework - the more so since current world trends point in the direction of regional integration as a means of standing up to the many challenges we face and as a necessary element for peace, harmony and stability

Let me express my delight at seeing Ambassador Garba of Nigeria in the Chair as President of the forty-fourth session of the General assembly. He is an experienced and distinguished son of Nigeria. I have no doubt that his well-recognized ability will greatly facilitate our work in the coming months. He may expect nothing less than total co-operation from my delegation.
We have come to the end of a historic political decade, in the affairs both of nation States and of the international community at large. In no other decade of this century have we witnessed such a rapid transformation of socio-economic and political philosophies and ideologies. At no other time in recent memory have so many men, once inveterate enemies, been so eager to step forward with pens rather than swords in their hands, anxious to drown past hostilities in ink. Truly in this decade many of us have come close to believing the maxim that the pen is mightier then the sword. It is indeed a time for reflection and stock-taking, and for setting new, greater goals for the future.
The decade of the 1980s dawned upon a world wherein dictators of the left and of the right had raised impermeable glass shields of sovereignty at their borders, and with impunity proceeded to violate every human and civil right of their people. We could look in, but could not enter. We listened to the screams but dared not speak. Foe what a man did in his own house was his own business.
But as the decade comes to a close X am happy to see the emergence of a greater sense of brotherhood in tine world. 'We the peoples of the United Nations', the first words of our Charter, are increasingly becoming 'We the family of the United Nations'. And indeed we are drawing closer to the full realization of our 'faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small'.
In this decade we have seen signs of progress even in relation to many of our. traditionally most intractable political problems, some as old as, or older than, the organization itself.
Since the adoption by the General Assembly at its first session, in 1946, of resolution 65 (I), the question of Namibia has been on the agenda off every regular session and several special sessions of the General Assembly. And we began this decade with no more hope than we had had when we came to tine end of the proceeding four decades. But as we close the 1980s the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is in plane, and it now seems certain that a free and independent Namibia, emerging out of free and fair elections, will soon take its rightful place, so long denied it, in the comity of nations. Regrettably, the new South African regime, amidst the sending of conflicting signals, continues to hold tenuously to the repulsive apartheid system.
All nations of men are made of one blood. And a regime that denies that this is so, and seeks to perpetuate a ridiculous notion of racial superiority by depriving the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa of their fundamental human rights, deserves contempt. We cannot but therefore continue to apply and maintain such pressure as could out an end to their affront to humanity.
In the Middle East, too, we have seen policies of naked confrontation, which have bedevilled the Organization almost - since its founding, give way to more reasonable, neither approaches which stress dialogue more than confrontation. The Palestine National Council is to be commended for its decision of 15 November last to accent Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967) and 338 (1973) fully, and consequently Israel's right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. The Government of Saint Lucia hopes that the Government of Israel will therefore begin to show greater flexibility in its approach to solving the problems in the Middle East. In this decade we have watched and applauded as General Secretary Gorbachev has tried to move the Soviet Union away from a Kafkaesque and Stalinist society to a country of glasnost and perestroika, as if saying 'let there be light', and taking the accent away from forced collectivisation and 'group-think' and placing it on individuality and openness - something only the most optimistic and Utopian of us would have dreamed possible only 10 years ago.
In the 1960s we have watched the super-Powers, for decades armed to the teeth and glaring at each other, nod slightly and awake to find that they had concluded a intermediate-nuclear-force agreement and were actually destroying some nuclear weapons - one small step away from mutually assured destruction. The journey of 1,000 miles had begun.
In this decade we have watched the authoritarian Government of Poland -dragged reluctantly into expressing solidarity with tine sine of Solidarity do a volte-face and agree to almost total economic and political liberalization. Lavish praise must be heaped upon that Government.
In tine 1980s we have watched Afghanistan, though still greatly troubled, begin to move towards a final solution to its problems. So, too, have we witnessed tine end of the fratricidal Iran-Iraq conflict. And in Central America, as Esquipulas II takes hold ballots seem ready to replace bullets in Nicaragua, as dialogue slowly moves to replace brutal confrontation in El Salvador.
And in ay own sub-region, the Eastern Caribbean, we are trying to take tine political gains we have made to what we believe are their logical extreme. Being of the view that the highest form of economic co-operation is political integration, sons of us, members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, will be moving with all deliberate speed towards a federation of our territories. We shall be counting on the support of the international community as we take this bold step. There are still areas where we have failed to make meaningful political progress in the 1980s. In fact, in some places we have seen political regression, as in the beleaguered Lebanon, which seems to be sinking deeper and deeper into a quagmire of political and religious violence. Saint Lucia hopes that the present cease-fire, facilitated by the Arab League, will usher in a new period of peace and reconciliation.
. In the People's Republic of China, too, recent events have both shocked and disturbed the world community. Saint Lucia's view is best summed up by a statement issued last July by the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, the right Honourable John Compton, as follows:
'The Government of Saint Lucia is deeply shocked by the Chinese Army's deliberate gunning down, in Tiananmen Square in China, of more than 300 Chinese citizens, the majority of whom were students. The Government believes that this event, one of the most brutal in modern history, makes it imperative for all the nations of the international community, big and small, to unite as one voice to protest the manner in which the expression of human freedom in China has been punished. In this age of human rights and human dignity, it is regrettable that a nation should resort to the use of army tanks and machine-guns to destroy the human spirit in its peaceful quest for freedom and expression. But the human spirit cannot be destroyed! it always resurfaces, and will do so repeatedly in China, until the political system of that country gives way to genuine democracy.'
While we have seen some signs of movement towards a constructive dialogue on the question of the reunification of the Korean peninsula, there have been no publicly announced breakthroughs which would lead my Government to believe that the problem will be settled in the very near future. Consequently, Saint Lucia believes that no constructive purpose can be served by any barriers that are kept in the path of either of the two Koreas wishing to become a full Member of the united Nations. Saint Lucia therefore unequivocally supports the desire of the Republic of Korea to become a member of the united Nations family, in the full confidence that it will make an outstanding contribution to the important work of this Organization.
Saint Lucia regrets the inability of the recent Paris International Conference on Cambodia to arrive at a comprehensive political settlement. Our position on the Kampuchean question is well known, as we have time and again enunciated it here. It is that the people of Kampuchea should be enabled to choose their own government without outside interference, subversion or coercion. Saint Lucia continues to maintain its position in support of all General Assembly resolutions on the matter.
The unsettled political situation in Panama is of great concern to us in Saint Lucia. We continue to support the initiatives of the Panamanian people themselves, and those of the Organization of American States, including the mission appointed by the twenty-first consultative meeting of foreign ministers.
In Haiti, too, after years of political oppression and economic denial, the people are struggling to create a genuine democracy as a prelude to meaningful and balanced economic progress. Saint Lucia supports them, and calls upon the entire international community to do likewise. In a statement I made to the press in Port-au-Prince in July I said:
'There are different views on whether international aid and the solution of Haiti's many social and economic problems should be a condition precedent for the holding of elections or should await such elections. My colleagues and I are convinced that there is no obvious reason why both sets of efforts. national arid international development efforts, and the taking of concrete steps towards the holding of elections, should not be pursued simultaneously.'
In the light of the announcement that local, parliamentary and presidential elections are all to be held next year, my delegation feels justified in urging the international community to renew its aid programme to Haiti, for man cannot live without bread.

Undeniably, the 1980s will be remembered for all time as a decade of great political progress on both the domestic and the international front. But, to be sustainable, political liberalization must be coupled with economic, social and scientific progress and prudence, in the South as well as the North. The developed countries cannot expect to succeed in crowning international political progress with North American bilateral trade pacts and European 1992 multilateral economic integration without a supportive reaction, or at the very least a paripassu or lock-step movement, in the developing world.
Last year the world economy grew by about 4.3 per cent and world trade increased by about 8.3 per cent, leading to an increase in world output per head of 2.6 per cent. That was beyond all expectations.
But in my own region, Latin America and the Caribbean, despite the debt concessions agreed to last year by the Group of Seven and the Paris Club, and despite the proposals made by the Governments of Japan and France and the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Nicholas Brady, all of which have made positive contributions, per capita gross national product has fallen precipitously as debt repayments have risen to more than a quarter of all export earnings. Our aggregate share of world trade has also fallen, as the productivity of labour has declined by about 2 per cent each year of the decade. In the Latin American and Caribbean region alone, it has been estimated, 250,000 young children died last year as a direct result of regressions in the development process.
Under conditions of extremely tight capital constraints, in 1988 the net transfer of resources from the developing countries exceeded $30 billion. And, especially in Latin America, the crushing debt burden has destabilized some internal economies, affecting both the supply and the velocity of money, and leading to major social conflicts which threaten the political order. Commodity prices, which are essential to most of the developing countries, declined in real terms in this decade by as much as 50 per cent in terms of their purchasing power vis-Ã -vis manufactured goods.  The majority of the least developed countries continue to stagnate, with negative growth rates or growth rates that are too low to keep pace with population growth. Of the 41 least developed countries, only 12 have recorded positive per capita growth over the past few years, with some even experiencing negative gross domestic product growth. In sub-Saharan Africa real income per head has declined almost every year of the decade and is now 14 per cent lower than it was 10 years ago. The continued use in the developed world of non-tariff trade barriers in such an unstable macro-economic environment further threatens the prospect for trade-led growth in the developing countries. 
Amid a superfluity of indices of increasing growth and prosperity in the world, we are sobered by the fact that average per capita income in the industrialized countries is about 50 times that of the least developed countries. During this decade more than half of the least developed countries implemented structural adjustment programmes with the International Monetary Fund, and those programmes did not always have a human face.
In such an economic environment the fundamental principles of the New International Economic Order, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, and the North-South dialogue must remain as valid, important and pressing issues.
The wind bloweth where it listeth, but we in the Caribbean are more often than not the victims of its wrath. The destructive impact of hurricane Hugo, which left a wake of disaster as it cut its way across the Caribbean only last month, underscores the extreme physical vulnerability of the island developing countries. Always buffeted by the consequences of smallness, remoteness, lack of natural resources and heavy dependence on imports, we must annually undergo the dreadful ritual of keeping a wary eye on the horizon for hurricanes and cyclones which seek to blow away our small, hard-won economic gains.
These problems are especially acute for small island developing countries, which, because of severe geographic and demographic constraints, have developmental problems which are unique, and therefore different from those of developing countries in general. Hence, traditional criteria, such as per capital gross national product, which are used to determine the quantum of aid needs and graduation from concessionary financing, should not apply to small island developing countries without substantial use of supplemental criteria.
Saint Lucia therefore looks forward to the holding. next year of the first United Nations conference on special problems and particular needs of island developing countries in the hope that it will give the international community a better understanding of the sui generis situation of the small island developing countries.
It cannot be said that the developing countries find themselves in these difficulties because they have not tried to help themselves. In fact, in our efforts towards sustainable growth and development we have looked not only to the North but also to collective self-reliance.
Last May, in Caracas, Venezuela, the developing countries celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Group of 77, and welcomed the eight years of the adoption of the Caracas Programme of Action on Economic Co-operation among developing Countries. One month earlier, the global system of trade preferences, the developing world's own most-favoured-nation trading regime, had come into force. Only last month we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Buenos Aires
Programme of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Co-operation among developing Countries, and adopted measures to strengthen technical co-operation among developing countries. And we look forward to next year's special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation, particularly the reactivation of growth and development of developing countries, when we hope to adopt more concrete measures both in relation to the North and among ourselves. 80, too, we prepare for the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade, which we expect will contain commitments and propose specific policy actions aimed at resolving the serious problem; of the developing countries.
In our haste to develop we must not be unaware of the potential environmental consequences of unrequited and irresponsible development.
We have all of late been slowly waking to the realization that we are taking a terrible toil on the ecological environment, with destructive consequences that seem almost deliberate. From the maniacal destruction of forests, to the dumping of toxic wastes in the ocean, to the release of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere, we have been destroying the land, sea and air at an astonishing speed, considerably raising carcinogenic dangers to ourselves.
In the Anglophone Caribbean, despite the dictates of the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships, we have become increasingly concerned by a series of nefarious attempts by foreign maritime operations to dump toxic substances in the Caribbean Sea in uncomfortable proximity to our shores.
Saint Lucia, therefore, supports all international attempts aimed at controlling those problems of runaway pollution, including the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer, and the recent Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which was adopted last March.
In co-operation with our close neighbours. Saint Lucia plans hotly to pursue, capture and prosecute to the fullest extent of both our national law and international law anyone caught illegally dumping toxic and other dangerous substances in our waters.
Our adoption last December of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was timely and, it is hoped, prophetic. Not since the bubonic plaque of the 1340s has mankind faced a social problem with such dire potential consequences for the youth of the global society. The traffickers in illegal narcotic drugs walk on cadavers and broken lives on their way to amassing huge, superfluous fortunes, giving credence to Erasmus's dictum that 'Great abundance of riches cannot be gathered and kept by any man without sin'. It cannot be allowed to continue. though outs is not a producing country, we in Saint Lucia have become more aware of the propensities of international drug traffickers to use the Caribbean as a trans-shipment point on their way to the bigger markets of the north. In this vein Saint Lucia strongly supports the new agenda item proposed by Trinidad and Tobago concerning the establishment of an international criminal court which, inter alia, would have jurisdiction over the transboundary movement of illegal drugs and the idea of an international strike force as proposed by Jamaica.
The Government of Saint Lucia within the parameters of the law intends to deal swiftly and harshly with anyone caught distributing or transhipping illegal drugs within its jurisdiction, and to apply without reservation all the provisions of the Convention, including extradition, the granting of mutual legal assistance and, where necessary, transfer of proceedings.
This then has been our view of what lies behind us in the past decade and what lies ahead in the final decade of this century. Saint Lucia has pledged itself to reach new economic and social heights in the 1990s, so that we may enter the twenty-first century with confidence; proud of what we have accomplished, and eager to do what we can, however humble, in the years ahead for the global good.
","The decade of the 1980s dawned upon a world wherein dictators of the left and of the right had raised impermeable glass shields of sovereignty at their borders, and with impunity proceeded to violate every human and civil right of their people. But in my own region, Latin America and the Caribbean, despite the debt concessions agreed to last year by the Group of Seven and the Paris Club, and despite the proposals made by the Governments of Japan and France and the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Nicholas Brady, all of which have made positive contributions, per capita gross national product has fallen precipitously as debt repayments have risen to more than a quarter of all export earnings.

It gives me pleasure at the beginning of my address to the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly to extend sincere congratulations to you, Sir, upon your election to the presidency of this session, as a faithful son of the glorious continent of Africa and as a representative thereof to this forum. Your election reflects the high esteem in which the international community holds your sisterly country, Nigeria, and your creative qualities and acumen. We are confident that you will discharge the onerous responsibilities of your high office successfully and enrich the traditions established by this great Organization.
On this occasion, I wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, for his great efforts during his term of office as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
Since the opening of the forty-third session last year, the world has witnessed important and cardinal developments, both at the international and regional levels. Such developments presage a new era of international relations and make it incumbent upon this gathering to prepare itself for it and follow it up through tine creation of an appropriate environment that would preserve the rights of States, great and small alike, and safeguard their security. Such an environment should ensure a role for everyone in this process, which does not concern the great Powers alone but is related to the future of mankind at large, particularly at a time when the problems facing the third world, especially in the economic domain, are still awaiting agreement on an acceptable framework to cope with them effectively.
Therefore we should seek together to broaden our vision of the world in this new era and to define the role each one of us should play in order to contribute to shaping this era and laying down its foundations. Without such collective participation by the family of nations, the era of detente will remain lacking in coherence and be susceptible to vacillation and retrogression, which would adversely affect our vision of the future.
My brothers, the African Heads of State or Government, have conferred on me the honour of electing me Chairman of the organization of African Unity at its present session. My country and I highly value this confidence. Egypt was in the vanguard of the liberation movement during an important phase of world history. As ever, Egypt is determined to pursue the struggle until the African continent is totally liberated from racism and oppression, until it rids itself of poverty and want, until it is able to tackle the serious challenges with which it is confronted, and to overcome the numerous problems impeding its drive along the path of development and progress. We firmly believe that, however acute those problems and challenges may be, the African community, with its rich reservoir of historic struggle and a capacity for collective action conducted on the basis of solidarity and team spirit, is amply capable of surmounting those obstacles with strong resolve.
If our first preoccupation is to tackle our domestic and regional problems and issues, we are also aware of the interrelatedness and interdependence of those problems and international conditions. Consequently, we are willing to play a primary role in laying down the framework of a new, transformed world in which dispute and controversy give way to common interests and in which natural and human resources are geared to serving the objectives of development and progress, instead of war and destruction.
A cursory glance at the challenges facing us at the African level reveals that foremost among them is the issue of confronting the policies and practices of the racist regime in southern Africa. The international community is unanimous in considering those policies as the main cause of the outbreak of acts of violence in that vital region of the continent and of the absence of political and social stability and security therein.
we must also constantly bear in mind that what the racist Government in South Africa describes as 'reforms' are mere superficial measures of form, which do not touch the substance. Moreover, they emanate from a racist outlook that aims at perpetuating the domination of the white minority and misleading the world into believing that steps are being taken in the right direction. If that regime were serious in its move, it would realize that democratic dialogue with the black majority is the only course for reaching a just settlement that would restore the legitimate rights of the oppressed majority, that would safeguard the interests of all parties and put an end to the escalating violence in the South.
Since its establishment, the United Nations has assumed a primary role in working for the independence of Namibia. Several resolutions have been adopted regarding the termination of South Africa's mandate over Namibia and the assumption by the United Nations of direct responsibility for its administration. The efforts made by the international Organization were crowned by the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This move was concomitant with the bitter struggle waged by the brotherly people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), to liberate their soil and regain their freedom. Allow me from this rostrum to pay a tribute to that heroic people which have given the greatest examples of sacrifice, and have demonstrated to the whole world the true mettle of the African peoples.
Despite our certainty of the inevitability of victory for the Namibian people and of their success in achieving independence on schedule, the situation calls for much caution and vigilance vis-Ã -vis attempts by the racist minority regime to sabotage this independence and undermine it from the inside, to fake the will of voters and to intimidate them. The Committee of African Heads of State or Government entrusted with following up the situation in southern Africa therefore met in Harare on 21 August 1989 to draw up plans to confront and foil these attempts so that the sun of freedom can rise again on that good land and we can celebrate this great event together next April.
The Committee also issued a declaration containing its conception of the African strategy required to confront moves by the racist regime of Pretoria. The strategy affirms equality of rights and obligations among all peoples, irrespective of colour, race, sex or ideology. It issued an appeal inviting peace-loving forces to adopt the call for the release of political detainees and prisoners in South Africa. Such a call deserves the wholehearted attention and support of the Assembly. We cannot tolerate the continuation of this ignominious disgrace in the history of humanity, nor can we be lax in dealing with the destructive effects it engenders. Therefore, it is the duty of the United Nations, which was established to uphold the right of all peoples to freedom and self-determination, to resist the perpetuation of that regime, to work for its further isolation, and to intensify pressure against, it by all possible means so that it can bow to the will of the international community and renounce illusions of being able to continue crushing the vast majority through intimidation, imprisonment, or detainment of intellectuals and freedom fighters.
Besides these crushing problems, the African countries suffer especially from the debt problem which has assumed serious dimensions. It also threatens to abort development programmes and is preventing the African countries from modernizing their systems of production and acquiring advanced technology, thereby perpetuating the vicious circle that causes poverty and underdevelopment.
In view of the intensity of this problem and the growing awareness of its seriousness, some countries have made praiseworthy initiatives aimed at arresting its effects and containing its complications. However, the ideas put forward are, in our view, inadequate for coping with the problem, its ramifications and its repercussions on the economic and social conditions in various countries of the continent. Therefore, I participated with the leaders of three friendly developing countries - Senegal, Venezuela and India - in proposing an initiative last July designed to reactivate the North-South dialogue and to enrich it by discussing the debt problem in its context. My colleagues, the brotherly African Heads of State or Government, at the recent African summit conference, blessed this initiative. They have mandated me to make the necessary international contacts to push the dialogue forward in the hope that it will lead to the convening of the international conference on debt, in accordance with the resolution adopted at the first extraordinary African summit conference, held in December 1987.
There is no doubt that the problem of indebtedness is part of a larger and more comprehensive problem, namely, the existing imbalances in the international economic order. These imbalances have reached proportions that cannot be overlooked or condoned. Consequently, the Ninth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Belgrade earlier this month, paid particular attention to this problem and placed it at the forefront of the Movement's priorities. The participating Heads of State or Government, who represent more than two thirds of the world leaders, agreed on the need to deal with this problem in a pragmatic, effective manner, given its aggravation and deterioration in recent years. This came as a result of the deterioration of terms of trade, the decline in primary commodity earnings, tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed on developing countries' exports, stagnation of financial flows for investment and development, increase of debt burdens and the net reverse transfer of resources. The problem for many third world countries, especially the African countries, is no longer one of growth and development, but rather one of survival in the literal sense of the word.
In this context, we have to decide that world attention to the economic problems of third-world countries should not be limited to providing emergency relief in cases of natural disasters or famine, but should extend to genuine contribution to accelerating the development process.
As was the case at the African summit Conference last July, the Non-Aligned summit meeting underlined the importance of engaging in fruitful dialogue with the industrial developed countries about fundamental economic issues. The summit meeting welcomed the quadripartite initiative proposed in the French capital during the summit meeting of the seven industrialized countries. 
The leaders of the non-aligned countries called for the need to translate the measures and initiatives aimed at debt relief into a comprehensive confrontation of the debt problem, through debt and debt-service reduction, provided such comprehensive tackling embraced all categories of indebted developing countries and all types of debt, both official and commercial.
The Non-Aligned Conference paid special attention to the critical economic situation in Africa. It called on the international community to speed up the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development by adopting policies conducive to accelerating growth and development in African countries. The Conference also urged the developed industrialized countries and the financial and development institutions to seek to increase financial flows to Africa and to improve the conditions of transfer and disbursement of these flows. It proposed that Africa's Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes constitute a basis for constructive dialogue between African countries and their development partners in the implementation and financing of country programmes.
Related to the international economic problem is the issue of the environment, whether at the word level or on that of Africa. In this regard we have to state two basic facts: first, that African countries are the least responsible for the disruption and deterioration of the environment in comparison with the responsibility of developed countries; secondly, that the deterioration of the environment in Africa is due mainly to poverty, and that an effective resolution of environmental problems resides in environmentally sound development, detrainment by developed countries from dumping nuclear and chemical debris in the territories and on the shores of African countries, and in helping those countries to use clean technology.
We have found in some of the developments on the international scene in recent years a glimmer of hope, whether those related to detente in East-West relations or the achievement of tangible progress in the field of disarmament. We are also witnessing the onset of a settlement to a number of regional problems within a limited span of time after long years of escalation and political and military confrontation. The progress made in this context cannot be accidental. Rather, it is a direct reflection of this improvement in the international climate because international political, economic and strategic conditions have become so intertwined and interrelated that each affects, is affected by, and interacts with the others, whatever the distance that separates the sites of events.
A scrupulous observer can reach the conclusion that, after our having been faced by challenges, hardships and common dangers that jeopardize our future, these positive developments usher in a new renaissance for all peoples of the world, characterized by dialogue between various communities towards coexistence and fruitful co-operation between East and West, North and South, rich and poor.
While the peoples of the third world welcome this positive development which heralds a new era in the history of international relations, they still have many fears and suspicions. This is due mainly to the fact that the detente we witness at present is still largely focused on super-Power relations. Its positive impact has not yet affected the international situation in general. It has not extended in a tangible manner to conditions in the third world, especially economic conditions and related serious social, environmental and political problems.
It is true that the super-Powers have concluded significant agreements in the field of disarmament. However, we deem it important for the world to make substantial progress in the field of comprehensive disarmament everywhere. Failing that, no actual development or genuine peace can be achieved. Nor can the results of disarmament be reflected in the enhanced security of third world countries or the prosperity of their peoples.
Third world countries also complain that the limited progress made in settling some regional problems has not embraced other, no less important and serious issues, and possibly even more crucial to the security, peace and stability of the whole world.
All this leads to the necessity of involving the developing countries in the ongoing dialogue because they are main parties to international problems.
Furthermore, they possess many human capabilities and natural resources. They also have social and cultural conditions that should be taken into account when examining major international issues.
For example, no one can question the call for respect of human rights. We all share the belief in the right of the individual to a free dignified life and his right to contribute to the formulation of the political and economic options of his country. However, we in the third world see another premise for this issue, namely that human rights are adversely affected by hunger, poverty and fear, by the unjust conditions of international trade, let alone foreign occupation of some of the territories of developing countries and the practice of a racist and exploitive policy against their citizens and their interests. Consequently, we insist on linking human rights as generally defined with the rights of peoples to freedom, progress and self-determination.
These notions were behind the objective discussion that took place at the recent summit of the non-aligned countries about those issues which preoccupy peoples everywhere and affect their security and safety. There was consensus within the Movement to seek to reach a common concept to face these urgent issues on the basis of comprehensive dialogue with developed countries. We hope this consensus will meet with the approbation of those countries and that they will look upon third world countries as an equal partner in the management of tomorrow's world, not a third party merely receiving what was decided in absentia, benefiting from the positive aspects, which it had not shared in forging, and suffering from the negative aspects, which it had not caused or helped aggravate.
The United Nations has always assumed an important role in laying down the bases of a settlement to the Middle East problem, particularly as regards the Palestinian problem, which enjoys special attention by all African and third
world countries. A milestone on the path of a just and peaceful settlement was Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which incorporated a perception of the balance that should be struck between the rights and obligations of both parties. This was complemented by the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at its consecutive sessions dealing with the rights of the Palestinian people.
The Middle East problem has undergone several developments that have brought the Palestinian question to the fore and demonstrated the importance of dealing with it in all its aspects if the objective is to reach a historic comprehensive reconciliation between the Arabs and the Israelis. Such a reconciliation would put an end to war, conflict and devastation. It would also pave the way for a creative coexistence between two parties which are not alienated by historical enmity or by theories based on racist or ethnic considerations. The two parties are bound by the same interest in consolidating peace, stability and development in favour of all the peoples of the region.
Therefore, we have insisted that the Palestinian people participate directly in the settlement efforts through the initiation of a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue supported by all peace-loving forces. Such dialogue is aimed at bridging the existing gap in positions, exploring the way to eliminate the conflict once and for all on the basis of applying the principle of land for peace and attaining coexistence and co-operation among all the peoples of the region. The Palestine Liberation organization, as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has taken positive positions that will help to achieve those goals. This deserves the full support of the international community.
I am pleased to state that the efforts we have been making in this respect in the past years have begun to bear fruit. Conditions are now favourable for launching such a dialogue without pre-conditions. It is hoped that the proposed dialogue would lead to a converging perception of steps that would pave the way for peace and for an overall agreement on the conditions and terms for a comprehensive settlement. Therefore, we believe that if this opportunity should be lost it would be a grave mistake certainly surpassing all errors made in the past which led to the loss of historic opportunities to contain the conflict and to end its aggravation.
Needless to say, this dialogue will not start from a vacuum. Rather, it will be based on the resolutions and positions which give it international legitimacy, in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. The dialogue should be followed by steps that require wider international participation within the framework of an international peace conference so that a final comprehensive settlement to that dispute, which has persisted for more than 40 years now, can be reached,
As far as the Iran-Iraq war is concerned, we express our satisfaction that the cease-fire has become an established fact. However, we cannot conceal our concern with the existing state of no peace, no war, and the probabilities of a new flare-up as a result of the non-completion of arrangements that would lead to the end of belligerence and all its related claims as well as the removal of all its complications. We truly consider that Iraq has declared its willingness to honour its obligations in the context of the sincere implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and in conformity with the August 1988 agreement. It has demonstrated its good faith to participate in the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that region.
We hope that Iran - which is bound to the Arabs by deep-rooted historical and spiritual ties - will adopt a decisive position in favour of peace and will seek to establish normal good-neighbourly relations with its Arab neighbours, especially with Iraq, so that Arab-Iranian relations can return to the situation maintained throughout history - a situation that is necessitated by geographical neighbourliness and a similarity of perils and interests.
We have also followed the bloody tragedy in sisterly Lebanon for years now with great regret and sorrow. We believe that the suffering of the Lebanese people must be ended. The threats to which they are subjected, which endanger their national and territorial unity, should be halted. This will be achieved only through the cessation of all forms of occupation and foreign intervention in its affairs, the removal of all restraints imposed on its independent national decisions, respect for its sovereignty and right to free choice and the elimination of aspects of partition which have intruded on Lebanon in these years of agony. We therefore support the sincere efforts made by the Arab tripartite committee towards achieving those objectives. We hope that those efforts will succeed, thus leading to the adoption of the decisive steps we anticipate within the few coming weeks.
Any setback in these efforts would have the most serious consequences to all parties, even if they are unable to grasp this indisputable fact.
I need not emphasize our full support for the United Nations and our adherence to its purposes, principles and Charter. They are entrenched in the hearts of our peoples and have been a source of inspiration for our peoples in formulating the framework that governs their domestic and international actions, particularly with respect to the Organization of African Unity, which was established to liberate Africa from domination and exploitation, and to apply the principle of equality among individuals and States, irrespective of their share of power or might, to achieve co-operation among the African States, which face the same dangers and challenges, to spread a human and noble message based on adherence to morality and sublime ideals in transactions, respect for the. rights of others, rejection of the theories of supremacy or discrimination between human beings and on building bridges between all nations and peoples.
The third world countries stand firm with all other countries in the world in expressing their confidence in the United Nations and their appreciation of its role, looking to the future of collective life on our planet with great hopes and aspirations. They have resolved to assert their will for the option of peace, to mobilize their resources to serve the objectives of development and progress, to orient their potential towards safeguarding security and stability and to open up vistas of hope for generations to come.
Through objective and constructive action, armed with clear vision that does not miss the target, with faith in the unity of human destiny and through adherence to legitimacy and the rule of law, we shall forge ahead towards a better tomorrow, nurturing the growth of freedom and hoisting the banners of peace, building glory and spreading civilization. With enlightened thinking and determined action, we
shall overcome hardships, surmount obstacles and barriers, place right before might and civilized discourse above the harsh growl of cannon.
","In this context, we have to decide that world attention to the economic problems of third-world countries should not be limited to providing emergency relief in cases of natural disasters or famine, but should extend to genuine contribution to accelerating the development process. In this regard we have to state two basic facts: first, that African countries are the least responsible for the disruption and deterioration of the environment in comparison with the responsibility of developed countries; secondly, that the deterioration of the environment in Africa is due mainly to poverty, and that an effective resolution of environmental problems resides in environmentally sound development, detrainment by developed countries from dumping nuclear and chemical debris in the territories and on the shores of African countries, and in helping those countries to use clean technology.

44,1989,MEX,"ï»¿
On behalf of the Government of Mexico, I congratulate the President on his election to preside over the work of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.
To the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, we again extend special thanks for his positive, judicious and persevering work at the head of the United Nations. Thanks to his diligence, no one can now question the Organization's decisive role in international relations, as the essential catalyst in the diplomatic activity of resolving through negotiation and dialogue the conflicts threatening our collective peace and security.
This is the first time the Government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, President of Mexico, has taken part in the Assembly's general debate. On his behalf, I again express my country's commitment to the purposes and principles of our Organization. Mexico is a founding Member of the United Nations. We have invariably supported its activities. The principles embodied in its Charter and its guiding purposes are fully in accord with our firm belief in an international community of nations, equal before the law and committed in peace and solidarity to the goal of growth with justice. We believe in the United Nations, because it enshrines the need to ensure that reason prevails over force. In a world still marked by the inequality and despair of so many, the United Nations is a clear example that we as human beings ore capable of working together for a better common future, regardless of ideologies and passing interests.
Over the past few months the international community has witnessed changes pointing to the end of an era of confrontation. For Mexico it is encouraging that the stereotypes of rivalry have been replaced by new concepts of co-operation and understanding. These advances teach us that solving the grave problems confronting international life is not an impossible objective.
The Mexican Government warmly welcomes the conclusion of the Tela agreements, signed by the Presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador aid Nicaragua. We unconditionally support the efforts made to find a lasting solution to a conflict which has bled white the Central American isthmus. Tela is the culmination of an arduous and complex negotiating process. We urge the international community to support the agreements and to ensure that they are not obstructed by interests from outside the area.
The responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in the process of bringing peace to Central America are clearly of the utmost importance. The success of the United Nations elections observer mission in Central America and of the International Verification and Follow-Up Commission will largely depend on the co-operation they receive from member States and on full respect for the wishes of the region's Heads of State.
Mexico will continue to extend its firm support for the efforts of the Central American Presidents to achieve peace, since peace is vital for the development of the peoples and the consolidation of democracy in the region.
The accomplishments on the political front have not meant parallel advances in the international economic arena, while States have committed their power and prestige to the solution of political conflicts, they are seeking to correct the profound economic imbalances by turning loose market forces, forgetting that those are the principal cause of the political tensions in many regions of the world.
The economic gap between North and South is wider than it was a decade ago, and we have done little to reverse the trend. For Latin America this has been a period of outright stagnation. The enormous transfer of resources to the developed world which we have made during this time has tested our peoples to the limit and threatens to destabilize our political institutions.
We cannot be ambiguous in confronting the problems facing us. It is now necessary to apply the same dedication to correcting economic imbalances as we have applied to the correction of political imbalances. Notwithstanding some differences of approach, there is general agreement that we are now at a watershed in world history. The next century must be spared the agonies of war and the extreme poverty that still afflicts millions of human beings, if liberty is to flourish and democracy is to have a real chance to survive.
How can the United Nations contribute to shaping the twentyâfirst century? The decade of the 1990s will be a crucial stage in fashioning that new reality. The agenda for action is long and complex, but Mexico considers that there are four major themes around which our thoughts and actions may converge.
The first theme is the democratisation of international society. The Organization's institutional structure will have adequately to reflect the profound changes and the multi-polarity which characterize current international society. We continue to be constrained by the system devised by the victors in the Second World War, in spite of the fact that we are living in a very different world, whose make-up has been radically changed by the widespread process of decolonisation and the redistribution of economic and financial power at the international level.
We believe that we shall be able to entrust our Secretary-General with the task of closely examining the different proposals that have been formulated for reorganizing the Organization's structure and operation, as well as the distribution of authority between the Security Council and the General Assembly, in order to reach a consensus which will give a new thrust to the Organization so that it can efficiently carry out its future responsibilities.
The United Nations urgently requires our effective support. Mexico urges every country with financial contributions outstanding to make them immediately. The financial crisis is so grave that it could bring down the United Nations at any moment. It is incomprehensible that day after day we ask the Organization to shoulder more responsibilities and yet we fail to provide it with the means to do so.
The second theme is the need for the United Nations to intervene in problems of economic co-operation and development. The Organization cannot be left out of this great effort to create a more equitable international economic situation. Mexico vigorously supports the holding of a special session of the General Assembly for economic co-operation and revitalization. The developing countries know that the solution to our problems depends fundamentally on ourselves. We have lost much time in talks trying to resolve these problems, with very tenuous results. It is certainly true that changing prices and financial fluctuations have been cruelly unfavourable for us in recent years, but there is no doubt that the internal effort of each country is the fundamental and determining factor in correcting our present situation. Let us begin by adjusting and modernizing our economies and making them efficient. Only in this way will we be able to increase our productivity and international competitiveness to the benefit of our peoples. Let us accept that the future of each of our nations depends precisely on what each one of them does.
By means of a wide range of concerted action and dialogue between the various sectors of our society, Mexico is resolutely making progress in an effort towards structural change, which entails sacrifice and discipline on the part of the Mexican people. The result has been encouraging, it has been reflected in a significant reduction in inflation and an economy confident of its future.
The correction of our economies is indispensable, but it is not a sufficient condition. There is no internal adjustment, however deep and lasting, which can bear fruit unless the country in question encounters a favourable international climate. The new international development strategy will have to put forward ambitious yet feasible and realistic objectives and goals. To this end. it will have to be designed in keeping with the efforts for cooperation and for maximization of the benefits of interdependence, which must in no case mean a loss of sovereignty.
The revitalization of international economic co-operation is urgent. It is the developed countries - those creditor nations benefiting from the net transfer
of capital - which must take the necessary steps to correct the imbalances in this area, it is up to them to realize that when structural adjustments are made, they mean growth and prosperity, and not frustration as has been the case in many of our societies. Prescriptions for good economic management and financial discipline cannot be measured with one yardstick for the North and another for the South. It was encouraging to hear various representatives of the industrialized countries refer to this problem of the great economic difference between North and South. We are sure that these statements imply that a commitment on this will be made in this new era of the United Nations we are witnessing.
The third key issue for society today is the commitment to deal with the international critical problems of our times with a genuine sense of shared responsibility. At best, interdependence should mean our ability to turn international co-operation into an effective tool to encourage economic and social progress and take joint action to solve problems of interest to mankind. Shared responsibility is based on the recognition of the legal equality of States and on strict respect for their sovereign decisions. This is the only legitimate framework for North-South dialogue.
With this spirit of solidarity, we shall be able to cope successfully with the common defence of human rights, with environmental protection problems and the fight against drug addiction and trafficking.
For the Government of Mexico, the defence of fundamental freedoms is of Particular importance. We will continue in our resolute support for the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human rights with a view to guaranteeing effective protection for the rights inherent in the human condition. The United Nations will also have to devote greater efforts to the consideration of women's rights and the protection of children, the most vulnerable 
Ecological issues are obviously global. in scale. The need for all nations to join efforts, every type of effort, make the United Nations the forum we need to deal with these urgent matters so vital to our future.
An understanding that revitalizing growth in the developing countries is indispensable for achieving adequate protection of the environment is crucial. It should not be overlooked that the principal cause of ecological imbalances and the solutions for then lie with these who have the most, with those who pollute the most and emit toxic substances, with those who consume the most fuel and have consumed the most fuel in the past. It is those very countries which have the most resources to combat environmental degradation.
The new dimension of the problem and its international nature require a wide-ranging and intense process of debate and discussion. The objective will be to achieve concrete commitments in keeping with the responsibilities and capabilities of each country. The International Conference on Environment and
Development proposed for 1992 will be an extremely important exercise towards those ends.
The demand for narcotics and psychotropic substances and their production, traffic and illicit consumption threaten the physical health of peoples and the political, economic, social and cultural structures of States. This is another of the global and interdependent problems of our times, and eradicating it requires efficient and constructive action through international co-operation which unfailingly respects the sovereignty and cultural identities of nations. We therefore welcome the signing of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in Vienna in December last year. We hope that the signatories will immediately decide to ratify it, and we urge those countries which have not yet ratified it to do so now. We also view with admiration and great respect the very valiant efforts being deployed by the
Government of Colombia to combat the drug traffic so resolutely in its country. The war in Colombia is not just a war involving Colombians) it should be a war waged by all countries of the world, as the problem is everyone's problem.
Mexico, for its part, is making a significant effort to combat drug trafficking. We know, though, that the struggle will be in vain unless there is a parallel campaign to combat consumption and against all the processes which finance and encourage drug abuse. To combat only drug production or traffic without at the same time resolutely tackling consumption will achieve only a shift in production sites and trafficking channels.
The fourth topic deserving of our attention is the reappraisal of the function of the State as a protagonist in economic processes and as agent of social well-being. Redirecting the function of the State to concentrate its efforts to serving the least protected sectors in our societies, which are undoubtedly in the majority, does not mean diminishing its power of governance and transformation. The demands for justice coming from developing societies must be channelled by the State and its legitimate representatives. The State must participate as a directing and an economic agent and should do so efficiently, productively and competitively, lb consider the role of the State in these times in a more wide-ranging and realistic manner, in both North and South, is a fundamental task, and one which we think should be carried out by our Organization.
Whether on its own initiative or in response to express requests, the United Nations today is an indispensable part in negotiating and implementing agreements to put an end to protracted conflicts throughout the world. However, there is still no peace in various regions, and the threat these conflicts represent is a real danger.
In the Middle East, Cambodia, Namibia and Central America our Organization takes the leadership in or supports delicate conciliation efforts at establishing peace. Mexico will continue to give its support to those efforts, upon the success of which lies the possibility of achieving a better world.
Mexico attaches the utmost importance to the question of general and complete disarmament. Activities undertaken by the Group of Six, an organization which at first was erroneously judged as Utopian, have already achieved concrete results. The repeated appeals of the Group to the nuclear Powers to stop the arms race have been well received and have hastened the climate of detente in which we live today, as well as the agreements readied by the super-Powers.
I shall now refer to the question of general and complete disarmament. Mexico unequivocally supports the complete cessation of all nuclear weapons testing as demanded by the majority of mankind. Together with Peru, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Yugoslavia, we are taking the initiative in presenting an amendment to the agreement prohibiting nuclear-arms testing in the atmosphere, outer space and under water, which has received the general support of the international community. Encouraging progress has also been made towards eliminating the terrible threat of chemical weapons. It is very satisfying to note the consolidation of the negotiating process between the countries of the Warsaw Pact and those of the Atlantic Alliance concerning the reduction of conventional armed forces.
We are now living through one of the most promising times in the life of our Organization since it was founded in 1945. we are nearing the end of a period of mistrust and ill will which, for more than 40 years, blocked possibilities for agreement and negotiations,
The artificial barriers of the cold war are crumbling on all sides. We are entering a more open world, one with better communications and more receptive to the need for human rights to be respected and for all to participate in the building of democratic government institutions. Myths that for years have served only to hide injustice are no longer acceptable. Peoples around the world have decided to take their destinies into their own hands.
This flourishing of determination must increase our spirit of tolerance and our concern for legality. Demands throughout the societies of the world that democratic institutions be increased and improved are being channelled through the existing structures of each country. Those voices can no longer be ignored. Each nation has the capacity to draw upon the lessons of its own history and experience, which will tell it how to modernize its institutions in order to strengthen its sovereignty.
This climate of change throughout the world has made us aware that the solutions to global problems cannot be left in the hands of only a few countries, however powerful they may be. Halting the deterioration of the environment, combating drug addiction and trafficking and predicting natural disasters are tasks requiring multilateral action. The Assembly must move towards recognizing that the United Nations is more necessary than ever given the interdependence of the modern world.
We cannot take pride in what we have achieved if we do not accept that the growth of the developing countries is an issue that affects us all. This requires a fresh approach to international co-operation, since only social and economic progress in the developing world can guarantee security and stability in the twenty-first century. The persistence of stagnation and poverty in the world's most populous regions is the most serious challenge we face. Let us see to it that this session of the Assembly marks the beginning of a period in which the international community as a whole makes a clear commitment effectively and realistically to take up and meet this challenge.*
","The principles embodied in its Charter and its guiding purposes are fully in accord with our firm belief in an international community of nations, equal before the law and committed in peace and solidarity to the goal of growth with justice.

44,1989,BEL,"ï»¿First of all, allow me warmly to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that you will carry out the lofty duties of your office with consummate skill and diplomacy, and my delegation will be happy to join in your efforts and co-operate fully with you.
I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo. The manner in which he guided our activities during the last session has earned him the unanimous esteem of the Assembly.
Following the remarkable statement delivered by my French colleague, Mr. Roland Dumas, on behalf of the European Community and its member States, there is little need for me to taking up every subject in the wide range of concerns shared by the Twelve in today's world.
Some 40 years ago, Mr. Paul-Henri Spaak, then Foreign Minister of Belgium, addressed the third session of the United Nations General Assembly in a remarkable speech that had a world-wide impact. Mr. Spaak, who was also President of the Assembly's first session just after the Second World War, stated in 1948 that Belgium's foreign policy, as well as the foreign policies of other Western democracies, was governed by fear, fear of the totalitarian way of government, fear in the face of territorial expansionism, fear of an ideology of world domination. His famous exclamation - 'We are frightened' - characterized the prevailing international climate at that time, the climate that led to the cold war - a kind of 'glasnost' in East-West relations - and, ultimately, to the lowering of an almost hermetically sealed Iron Curtain.
Owing to that fear, the political question of East-West relations was for many years to come to be couched mainly from a military perspective. East-West antagonism exacerbated some third-world conflicts, and an arms race ensued that took on surrealistic dimensions.
It is a fact of history that equilibrium based on mutual deterrence has been the contributing factor in the prevention of a third world war. Today, however, we find that the arms race has put a considerable strain on our economies and has swallowed up tremendous sums that could otherwise have been channelled into social benefits or into development assistance. In addition, new technologies in modern armaments, as well as the proliferation of all kinds of weapons, seem even to have increased the danger of a sudden conflict's escalating beyond control.
It has new become obvious - although the obvious is not always apparent - that peaceful co-operation is an infinitely more secure, more moral and less expensive basis on which to build peace than are relations expressed in terms of pure military strength.
The political and economic reforms now being introduced in various socialist countries fill us with hope - hope for courageous policies of renewal, hope for more democratic and prosperous societies and, in particular, hope that the old feelings of fear and mutual distrust may gradually be transformed into ever-growing mutual trust through enhanced East-West co-operation. Reforms in Eastern-bloc countries have become absolute necessities under the pressure of various factors that have shown themselves more powerful than even the best-equipped ideologies.
The media and other modern means of communication have shrunk our world to village proportions. At the end of the day no State can afford to live in isolation, ignoring the outside world. New technologies, offsprings of creativity, research and the exercise of the critical spirit, meet with difficulties when trying to expand in centrally planned systems. The market economy, however imperfect, appears to be better suited to bringing about the third industrial revolution. As President Mitterrand recently stated, it is no coincidence that the countries with a democratic, pluralistic political system and a market economy based on free competition, subject, of course, to social correction, are also the ones in which the greatest degree of political and economic freedom for the greatest number of citizens goes hand in hand with the highest level of well-being and social justice. More than subtle ideological hair-splitting, hard facts demonstrate that a Western social and economic model of development, linked with the principle of pluralistic democracy, exerts an immense attraction for many countries in the world. That is given further confirmation in Europe by the continuous flow of refugees and immigrants from East to West.
It is clear that efforts made in the field of armaments, which in certain countries has accounted for up to 15 per cent of gross national product in recent years, have completely precluded the pursuit of economic policies that can effectively address the needs of the populations. Consequently, economic and political reform must be accompanied by arms control and arms reduction if political decision-makers want to avoid a number of vicious circles.
We realize how difficult and delicate the implementation of such a process of political reform can be. The complementarity of economic and political liberalization entails striking an extremely fragile balance. As Foreign Minister Roland Dumas stated on behalf of the Twelve, the fact that China has not acknowledged this fact and this parallelism has given rise to a tragic reversal.
We welcome the favourable developments that have emerged from the disarmament negotiations in Vienna and Geneva. The numbers now on the table can be qualified as quite spectacular. The reduction of the level of armaments must be established in a balanced and reciprocal manner, and it must be accompanied by absolutely trustworthy verification mechanisms. Those are the prerequisites for an even more comprehensive disarmament process. We also welcome President Mikhail Gorbachev's reference to the possibility of a 'defensive defence', that is, a disarmament process that renders any attack impossible and that, at the same time, continues to guarantee effective defence utilizing the most modern weapons at the lowest possible level of deployment. That is precisely what we have always tried to achieve. Indeed, our primary goal is to arrive at a state of defence that is mutually and sufficiently deterrent with the smallest possible arsenal, thereby creating maximum stability and security. 
Belgium hopes that new disarmament agreements between East and West can be very rapidly concluded, and that as a consequence major financial resources can gradually be freed so that we can pay more attention to other priorities. In the Eastern bloc as well as in Western countries, these financial resources could be spent on modernizing economic and industrial structures and on improving social conditions. Also, we must not forget conservation of the environment and the establishment of -a suitable policy on the environment. A major conference on this subject is to be held shortly in Sofia as part of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The United Nations also has an important role to play in this field, particularly in respect of preparing universal rules and standards. In this context, the important Conference on Environment and Development, which is to take place in 1992, will be a real challenge, one which we must meet. We did not receive our planet Earth, which is getting smaller every day, as an inheritance from our parents: rather, we have borrowed it from our children. Our responsibility here is enormous, irrespective of what our economic and political systems may be.
Disarmament and better understanding between East and West can also have a decisive influence on the North-South dialogue and can shed a fundamentally different light on what the approach should be to the problems of the third world. If confidence between East and West grows, many regional conflicts, which are in fact tragic side-effects of the tensions between the two great Powers, can probably be ended. We cannot but rejoice at the progress made in this area and at the many efforts made by all sides toward solving, peacefully through talks and negotiations, a whole range of regional conflicts and chronic tensions. It is none the less true that there are situations still persisting which provide heart-rending examples of violence and repression, such as Lebanon â until recently - and the Middle East and various other regions. Belgium pays a tribute to the Arab League and to the three mediators for the positive role they have played in the Lebanese question, and hopes that the peace process in that region will enable us to bring a speedy end to hostage-taking and to the inhuman fate that has befallen five of my compatriots whose names have been added to the long, sad list of hostages from other countries.
Improved East-West relations and better economic conditions in the industrialized countries are vitally important in our relations with the third world countries. At the special session of the General Assembly in 1979 and at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Manila, I submitted a proposal, on behalf of Belgium, for the implementation of a pact for growth in solidarity between the industrialized countries and countries in the third world which wished to join. The pact envisaged a substantial increase in development aid in direct proportion to the economic growth in each participating country and was geared to generating growth within the third world itself. Now that the world economy is healthier and East-West relations are developing in a positive direction, I think that this Belgian proposal could be brought up to date and submitted to the appropriate United Nations organs for thorough examination.
If we could unite our forces to usher in a post-cold-war era, other proposals and ideas could be envisaged. Why, for example, should it be inconceivable to implement triangular development projects, to be carried out, in a third-world country, by a Western country in association with an Eastern-bloc country? Why, indeed?
Concerning the explosive problem of the indebtedness of the third-world countries - although other countries are also facing the snowballing, devastating effects of debt burdens - Belgium supports the multilateral approach of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Belgium recently decided on cancellation, pure and simple, of the State-to-State loans made to 13 African countries. Moreover, Belgium and Zaire have concluded an agreement for Belgium to waive payment of a third of Zaire's commercial debt to Belgium and to reschedule the outstanding interest payments. The package was coupled with the establishment of a re-utilization fund in Zairian currency for local development projects. We hope that this agreement between Belgium and Zaire will set an example to other creditor and debtor countries. In respect of Africa, and primarily Rwanda and Burundi, Belgium is pursuing a coherent policy towards reaching imaginative solutions to debt problems, with firm emphasis on joint management of the funds allocated to development.
The problems of the third world have been considerably aggravated by the scandalous traffic in arms, itself too often financed by the even greater disgrace of the traffic in drugs. Belgium favours an effective international embargo on all arms exports to belligerents, and we welcome the remarkable and extremely courageous efforts of the President of the United States, Mr. George Bush, and the President of Colombia, Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas, in combating drug production and trafficking.
The international community will understand that the countries of the European Community attach great importance to respect for human rights and that our aid and co-operation are assessed in terms of the progress made in human rights. Indeed, we believe that all people, as individuals, as human beings, wherever they are in the world, have the right to the full enjoyment of their inalienable rights and the exercise of their fundamental freedoms. In saying this, and in acting as we do, we Europeans cannot but be modest and self-critical. This year, 1989, is the year we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War on our old continent, which saw the most terrible and complete negation of human rights in the history of mankind. Belgium would like to pay a tribute to the unrelenting efforts of the United Nations and fully associates itself with them. Thus Belgium is participating in the United Nations action in Namibia and has sent people there as part of the peace-keeping operations to assist in monitoring the independence process. I wish to pay a tribute to the tireless efforts and devotion of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and of his staff, which have led to the achievement of solutions to many conflicts through negotiation and conciliation.
We also fully support the efforts that are being made within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to reach an agreement on the banning of all chemical weapons. We must all work together to enable the United Nations to work even more effectively. Theoretical and ideological debates are not getting us far enough; only programmes of concrete action are worthwhile.
The European Community - with its common market soon to be achieved, with economic and monetary unity, having in view a political unification, hence a common foreign and security policy - this Community, comprised of 12 member States, hopes to become an increasing factor in stability, peace and co-operation in the world, especially in Europe. I sometimes wonder whether this Europe we are striving for is being perceived correctly abroad. There are those who fear the Community, others who encourage it, and still others who ignore it.
The Europe of today was born of dreams but also of a sense of the realities which, 40 years ago, gave rise to the first attempts at integration. Europe is neither a self-centred fortress nor a mill open to all passing winds. Rather it seeks to be a magnet and a model for progress, generating freedom and happiness for its citizens. This Europe of the Twelve is not a Power, it is a potent force.
This Europe which is ours and which we are continuing to build day by day prefers co-operation to confrontation in all its affairs. We firmly believe that a strengthened European Community can contribute significantly to the establishment of genuine co-operation between East and West, so that the last scars left by the Second World War can finally be healed in our hearts and in reality.
A common European house is conceivable only if it is indeed a truly democratic house, where every citizen will be free to enjoy his fundamental political and economic freedoms as well as adequate social protection - where State authorities serve the individual and not the contrary. 'Everybody is somebody' must be the humanist maxim of Government in our modern societies, where the growing complexity tends to overwhelm the individual. We must therefore give priority support to those countries that effectively implement policies of reform based on those values. That is the reason for our present aid to and co-operation with, countries such as Poland and Hungary.
The common European house - that of co-operation between East and West - need not result in a Europe of uniformity. It may have different rooms in which each separate people may organize itself as a State, according to its right to self-determination. But it is obvious that such a European house is unthinkable as long as a Berlin Wall continues to divide Europeans.
There are many signs of hope appearing on the horizon. Let that hope not be deceived. After decades of fear and mutual terror, reciprocal confidence must increase. It is not too early; indeed it is high time.
","The political and economic reforms now being introduced in various socialist countries fill us with hope - hope for courageous policies of renewal, hope for more democratic and prosperous societies and, in particular, hope that the old feelings of fear and mutual distrust may gradually be transformed into ever-growing mutual trust through enhanced East-West co-operation. As President Mitterrand recently stated, it is no coincidence that the countries with a democratic, pluralistic political system and a market economy based on free competition, subject, of course, to social correction, are also the ones in which the greatest degree of political and economic freedom for the greatest number of citizens goes hand in hand with the highest level of well-being and social justice. Now that the world economy is healthier and East-West relations are developing in a positive direction, I think that this Belgian proposal could be brought up to date and submitted to the appropriate United Nations organs for thorough examination. The European Community - with its common market soon to be achieved, with economic and monetary unity, having in view a political unification, hence a common foreign and security policy - this Community, comprised of 12 member States, hopes to become an increasing factor in stability, peace and co-operation in the world, especially in Europe. We firmly believe that a strengthened European Community can contribute significantly to the establishment of genuine co-operation between East and West, so that the last scars left by the Second World War can finally be healed in our hearts and in reality."

At the very outset, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your election to this high office is an expression of confidence in your great diplomatic skill and your wealth of experience that will contribute to a successful conclusion of our work. My delegation and 1 are confident that you will be able to give this session wise guidance.
I also wish to extend our congratulations and thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his excellent service as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Our congratulations and appreciation also go to the Secretary-General for his unceasing efforts and devotion to his work for the United Nations.
As 1990 approaches, we are leaving behind a decade much of which has been characterized by a succession of international crises in many parts of the world. However, many fundamental changes and developments have also taken place in the closing years of the 1980s. The easing of tension between the super-Powers has gained momentum, as demonstrated by the summit meetings between the United States and the USSR and between the USSR and China. The drive for peace in many parts of the world has led to attempts by the United Nations and other regional organizations to resolve problems which in the last decade seemed insoluble.
In Afghanistan, the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops, although a political settlement and durable peace remain to be achieved. In Namibia, the terms for a settlement have been agreed. We hope that very soon Namibia will be able to hold a free and fair election, and we look forward to welcoming Namibia in our midst as a fully independent and sovereign nation. The Iran-Iraq war has
stopped but the process of reconciliation has been very slow. As for South-East Asia, there are ongoing regional as well as international efforts to resolve the Kampuchean problem. We should continue to strive for a peaceful solution to the conflict.
It is encouraging to note that the international situation has changed, bringing a new attitude to solving conflicts. There is a more conciliatory trend now. This is in line with the principles of the United Nations that call on its Member States to settle disputes by peaceful means. Hence, the principles of the United Nations have increasingly gained in importance as instruments promoting peace and stability in the world today. Furthermore, the current improvement in the world situation has been effected by the responsible attitude of Member States of this world body in respecting those principles. These developments should offer better prospects for peace around the world.
It is a sad fact that the negotiation of disputes does not always guarantee complete peace and stability. In a number of cases, while negotiations have taken place, violent hostilities or rivalry between the parties concerned continue, and thus hinder a comprehensive solution, thus perpetuating the misery of the ordinary citizens. We have arrived at just such a position in the attempts to settle the problems in the Iran-Iraq war, Afghanistan, the Middle East and Kampuchea and in other cases. This does not augur well for the further improvement of the general world situation. In those conflicts where a comprehensive solution remains elusive, owing to failure at the negotiating level, the scourge of war will remain a threat. Peace is not merely the absence of war. Unless it is realized that the cessation of hostilities must be accompanied by a genuine desire to resolve disputes at the negotiating table, conflicts around the world will be far from being settled.
I am particularly concerned that despite increasing international efforts, peace and stability have not been achieved in such areas as the Middle East, South Africa and Kampuchea.
The Palestinian problem remains a matter of great concern to the international community. The cries for justice and freedom in the occupied Palestinian territories continue to fall on deaf ears. Despite world condemnation, Israel still continues to pursue its aggressive policy and to refuse to recognize the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Such a negative attitude,
especially towards the convening of an international conference, will only lead to the escalation of violence and fighting in the occupied territories. My delegation feels that the International Conference would be useful in bringing all parties concerned to the negotiating table. We also wish to reaffirm our view that the Palestine Liberation Organization should be included in the Conference as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
The intensity of the conflict in Lebanon saddens us. The international community watches in horror as the population endures daily carnage. While there is no simple solution to the 14-year-old conflict, we should not leave Lebanon to its own fate either. In the name of humanity, we urge those who have influence with the opposed parties to continue to find a way to aid the conflict. In this regard, I welcome the effort of the Arab League to appoint a tripartite commission.
Another depressing problem that continues to challenge this world body is the apartheid system of the racist regime in South Africa. The regime not only arrogantly and stubbornly refuses the international calls to dismantle its evil system but also uses a policy of aggression to oppress the black population. Thus, we would like to repeat our support for the international community in calling on South Africa to stop its racist policy of apartheid and to grant the black majority of the South African population their basic rights to equal opportunities and equal participation in the political process. In this connection, we would also like to reaffirm our support for the imposition of mandatory and comprehensive sanctions on South Africa in order to put greater pressure on the regime to end its oppressive policy of apartheid.
In our own region of South-East Asia, it is regrettable that the recent International Conference in Paris did not succeed in bringing about a comprehensive
settlement of the problem of Kampuchea. Once again, the parties concerned in the conflict could not agree on the elements and terms for a lasting peace. The unilateral withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea this month will not guarantee peace and stability in Kampuchea, unless there is an answer to the question of the provisional or interim authority, from which the process of national reconciliation and assurances of the observance of the peace process should evolve. At the Paris Conference the parties concerned did not speak the language of reconciliation-, rather suspicion and rivalry predominated.
The lack of success should be attributed as much to the absence of political will and unwillingness to compromise as to the failure to subordinate sectional interests to greater national interests. Testing each other's strength on the battlefield in order to arrive at a solution is a dire option which would have disastrous consequences. However, despite the absence of progress in the recent International Conference on Kampuchea, the fact that it has taken place reflects the continued commitment of the international community to resolution of the long-standing problem through peaceful means. It is vital that we should not abandon that commitment to the finding of a peaceful comprehensive settlement.
Today I have pointed out some areas where some progress has been made and where disputes could be settled peacefully through negotiation and I have stressed the importance of pursuing negotiation as a better means of ending conflicts than settling them by force. We are all aware of the attendant difficulties, but it is our wish that this option of settling disputes by peaceful means should prevail. And so we call on the parties concerned to show the necessary political will and we call on all members of this body to support the United Nations efforts to achieve the peaceful solution of conflicts wherever they may occur.
","Your election to this high office is an expression of confidence in your great diplomatic skill and your wealth of experience that will contribute to a successful conclusion of our work. In a number of cases, while negotiations have taken place, violent hostilities or rivalry between the parties concerned continue, and thus hinder a comprehensive solution, thus perpetuating the misery of the ordinary citizens.

On behalf of the Rwandese Republic, allow me first to convey our warmest congratulations to Mr. Garba of Nigeria, as well as to the officers of the Bureau, who have been elected to guide the work of this session of the General Assembly. Mr. Garba's unanimous election as President of the General assembly at its forty-fourth session is a tribute both to his outstanding diplomatic qualities and to his country, Nigeria, and all of Africa. Our congratulations go equally to the President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session and his associates for the competence with which they guided the work of that session.
should also like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the skill, determination, maturity, understanding and wisdom he has shown in carrying out his complex tasks, as a result of which our Organization has recorded many successes and enhanced its prestige.
The Rwandese Republic is proud to join the great family of the united Nations within the prestigious and solemn framework of the forty-fourth session of the General assembly. 
The annual sessions of the General Assembly unquestionably provide the best opportunity to celebrate peace and the brotherhood of the nations of the world and to take stock forthrightly and constructively of the world's economic, political and social health.
The twin pillars of our work continue to be the safeguarding of international peace and security and the building of permanent relations of friendship and co-operation between nations. Our work is part of the long march of the peoples towards the realization of the highest aspirations of all mankind - the development of international harmony and freedom and progress for all peoples.
Rwanda reiterates its solemn commitment to the cause of peace and pays a heartfelt tribute to the United Nations for the great successes it has recorded since its creation, we take this opportunity to express the hope that the bends of fraternity and solidarity between peoples will be made even stronger, in order to put an end to the economic and political crisis that is persisting in the world, particularly in the southern hemisphere, including Africa.
Despite efforts at various levels to achieve agreement and integration, despite the internal adjustments that have been made, often at the cost of great sacrifices, and despite the goodwill shown both bilaterally and multilaterally at the international level, the crisis continues, the debt increases and the gulf of recession grows deeper year by year, to the detriment of the world's weakest economies.

The Rwandese Republic is convinced that the sombre picture of the world economy will not be improved without the establishment of a true balance, with fairer payments for raw materials and basic commodities. Therefore, there must be a fundamental reform of the mechanisms and structures of international trade, to the benefit of the still underdeveloped peoples of the South, who provide the raw materials for the prosperous industries of the North. 
The continuing economic stagnation afflicting the least developed countries is rooted in the long-standing injustice in the world market. There has already been much discussion of that unfortunate situation. We are amazed by the silence and unwillingness to act of the majority of wealthy countries as they see our societies inexorably trapped in a vicious circle of poverty and debt.
The pernicious, exponential growth of Africa's indebtedness has often been criticized here, and there is a risk of the phenomenon's becoming a tired refrain in diplomatic rhetoric as the years pass. The tragedy has become a sad reality that worsens day by day, aggravated by climatic hazards and other natural disasters, which in several regions of our continent have been particularly severe this year.
Rwanda, which has suffered as much as have other African countries, once more appeals to the international community for more effective solidarity and mutual understanding with regard to Africa's external debt. My country takes this solemn opportunity sincerely to praise the various generous initiatives of some friendly countries - such as the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada, France, Belgium and Japan - to lighten the debt burden. Those initiatives range from the forgiveness of interest on the debt to the cancellation of accumulated debts.
The Rwandese Republic appeals to all other wealthy countries to join in those initiatives. Above all, we plead for the working out and implementation of a lasting global strategy that will make it possible for all the debtor countries to liquidate once and for all their public debt, both commercial and private. Rwanda reaffirms its total support for the common African position on the subject. We support the appeal for the holding of an ad hoc international conference, and believe that the elimination of the crisis would be a vital step on the road towards improving the international economic environment.
He must make the most of the desire to be realistic which has become manifest in recent months at the bilateral level. It must be extended to include all the least developed countries, but we must also implement international strategies and action to bring about the economic recovery of the poor countries, to Which solemn commitments have been made.
Rwanda contends that, faced with the persistence of the crisis, we must see that the strategies and plans of action go beyond mere words and become a reality, with on the one hand North-South co-operation and on the other hand vigorous efforts to bring about economic integration based on genuine South-South, regional and sub regional co-operation.
The economic situation of Africa and the developing countries in general is  today more worrying than ever before. Here I should like to stress the fears and hopes that we the African countries in the category of the least developed feel
faced with the gloomy prospects for the world economy that recent events have revealed.
The Group of 77, which provides both the ideal forum for South-South co-operation and an appropriate framework for negotiations with the developed countries in the context of the North-South dialogue, has just celebrated a quarter of a century of existence. Despite differences of opinion, it has reason for at least partial satisfaction at some achievements, notably the maintenance of relative unity and cohesion and the launching in 1974 of a world-wide appeal for a new economic order, an appeal which, unfortunately, when it came up against reality, did not get beyond the stage of a slogan, but which is now more relevant than ever. I should also mention here the adoption in 1981 of the Caracas Programme of Action on Economic Co-operation among developing Countries, which, despite being buffeted by events, also remains relevant.
However, although there is now a keener awareness of the problems, this silver jubilee comes at the end of a wasted decade. Nevertheless, perhaps some good can come out of its we must all learn from the failures of the past, as we approach the last decade of the twentieth century, and make the 1990s a decade of economic recovery. Ail the necessary resources must be mobilized in support of the universal implementation of a more realistic and more efficient international development strategy. We once again call upon the most industrialized countries and the international financial institutions to show goodwill and realism in their policy on the debt and to help free the South permanently from economic stagnation.
We ask that suitable, fair measures be taken to support the effort, that our countries are making, which involve considerable sacrifices, and that better integrated and better adapted solutions be devised with the full co-operation of all parties to guarantee mankind a balanced, harmonious future.
We strongly urge that all the necessary intellectual and moral resources be mobilized in the search for solutions to the economic crisis of the third world in general and of Africa in particular. Those solutions should take into account all the dimensions of the problem, without forgetting or overlooking the social aspects, for the peoples rather than States must be the main beneficiaries of recovery measures. A stifled third world would undoubtedly be a latent threat to the prosperity of the industrialized societies. The economic situation of Africa and the third world is indeed disastrous. Rwanda refuses, however, to yield to despair; it earnestly appeals to all nations of goodwill in the Assembly to work with renewed determination and vigour in all sectors, in order to overcome poverty and desolation.
We appeal for unstinting support from the international institutions, programmes and plans of action already in place and from those vet to be agreed. I refer in particular to the new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade for the period 1991 to 2000, in connection with which the ad hoc preparatory committee is actively pursuing its work. I refer also to the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, scheduled for September 1990 in Paris, and to the April 1990 special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries. In the area of international co-operation in which the stakes and challenges are enormous, the Rwandese Republic favours negotiations as the best way to promote a just and balanced world economic order.
Rwanda firmly supports the appeal made in Caracas at the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Group of 77, and at the time of the celebration of the bicentenary of the French Revolution by a group of Heads of State from the countries of the third world, for a decisive resumption of the North-South dialogue and for the promotion of international economic co-operation for development. In this connection, we are convinced that there must be major structural changes in the world economy and we believe that all countries, rich and poor, much commit themselves to international co-operation within the framework of interdependence which is inevitable. might makes right has been a feature of international economic relations, but it must no longer be accepted. We believe that the current crisis, regardless of responsibility, must be viewed in a new light and that the continuing transfer of resources from the South to the North must yield to a more balanced system from which any form of exploitation will be excluded.
The United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, which was adopted by the General Assembly in June 1986, is rapidly coming to an end and might well have little impact on the economic picture of the continent, which was true also of the United Nations international development strategy for the last three decades.
A basic problem of crucial importance is still before us, and the Rwandese Republic fully supports the ad hoc resolution of the 25th Summit Conference of the Heads of State or Governments of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), held in Addis Ababa in July 1989. In that resolution the Heads of State or Governments of the OAU appealed to the international community substantially to increase the resources of the Programme, in particular within the framework of the International Development Association (IDA); to extend the Programme beyond 1990; to create additional facilities for financial assistance to intermediary-income African countries non-beneficiaries of the IDA; and to intensify efforts to mobilize resources of the North in support of the economic and social recovery of Africa.
Rwanda is convinced that such recovery requires joint efforts by both the South and the North*, the South, by making the appropriate comprehensive structural reforms and improving the macro-economic management of its growth, while endeavouring to stabilize its balance of payments; and the North, by committing itself to supporting these actions through fostering measures of assistance
by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and through specific initiatives ranging from the reduction of interest rates to the cancellation of debts, within the framework of a global strategy.
We believe that to be truly helpful the structural adjustment of our economies must also be balanced by readjustments in the North; otherwise it runs the risk of amounting to a sterile process of contraction with disastrous political and social consequences. In our opinion, without it the deterioration of the economic and social conditions in African countries will continue, notwithstanding the efforts made by Governments through policies and programmes to bring about stabilization and structural adjustment.
In the spirit of General Assembly resolution 43/27, urging our countries to increase their efforts to produce a viable and practical conceptual framework for an economic programme of structural adjustment, and in keeping with the objectives and strategies based on the Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos and on the United Nations programme of Action for Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, the latest Summit Meeting of the OAU has just adopted the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes (AAF SAP) for socio-economic recovery and transformation.
Rwanda believes that this is a vital, pragmatic instrument for integration, and we hope that it will make it possible for African countries to continue to adjust their economies while ensuring that this adjustment will bring sustained growth and real development in its train.
In this connection, Rwanda supports the appeal of the OAU to the international community and the multilateral financial institutions, as well as the General Assembly, to give greater thought to the AAF SAP and to show greater understanding of the efforts and the realities of structural adjustment in Africa. Together with the efforts that have been made within the framework of North-South co-operation, which is indispensable, the Rwandese Republic believes strongly in the principles and objectives of economic integration as the basis for a self-sustained endogenous development in the context of States and within the sub regional and regional frameworks, in keeping with the spirit of Lagos. Prom this perspective, we fully support the resolution adopted at the latest Summit Conference of the OAU on the Second Industrial Development Decade in Africa and the proclamation of 20 November as African Day of Industrialization.
Indeed, the importance of a Second Decade in this area is not justified only because the objectives of the First Decade have not been achieved, but above all because well-conceived industrialization is a major asset in creating structures within the framework of economic growth and in the search for lasting solutions to the economic crisis and indebtedness. Industrial investment is, moreover, a fruitful way for African countries to take their destiny in their own hands by way of playing a better, uninhibited role in the world economy.
while in this framework the style of development advocated by the North is new irreversible, it is still true that the indispensable transfer of technologies from the North to the South must take place in conditions which make these technologies accessible and acceptable. Perhaps it would be naive to speak of industrialization without making specific reference to the traditional problems with regard to commodities and the harmful machinery of world trade.
Though the international community is pleased with the creation in July 1989 of the Common Fund for basic commodities, the serious concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Fund that have been created by. the inequities in the world economy must not be disregarded.
The non-industrial countries that provide raw materials are caught up in inextricable difficulties ranging from insufficient production to lade of access to international markets and deterioration in the prices received for their raw materials. Internally, these countries are not able to be self-sufficient in food for their people. At the same time industrialized countries are perfecting protectionist techniques and creating real regional empires.
Thus misunderstanding between the two groups is growing, creating suspicion and giving rise to meagre results in the commercial negotiations that have been taking place within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Language unacceptable to both sides has been used, and completely different goals are being pursued.
Rwanda pleads for a better balance for Africa and third world countries and for poor countries to be given an opportunity to export, profitably, food, agricultural products and manufactured and semi-manufactured products. Regrettably, present methods of exchange encounter closed markets, and traditional networks of exploitation that have been particularly harmful to developing countries are continually encountered.
On this one-way street, which only increases the dependence and fragility of African economies and third-world economies in general, the African countries are continuing to witness, powerlessly the continuing deterioration of their sources of income that results from the median isms imposed by the great northern industrialized countries, which is the source of the vicious cycle that characterizes the whole process of production and marketing. The most flagrant case is that of the difficulties being encountered in the present negotiations within the framework of the new international agreement on coffee, a product in a particularly perilous state though it is one of the pillars of many of our economies.
Rwanda, rather than yielding to pessimism, favours the emergence of a new style of co-operation that is more effective and takes the form of appropriate programmes of action that enable our countries to diversify their production and deal with the deficits we have always experienced, which have been a severe handicap.
In the spirit of such interdependent co-operation, from this rostrum Rwanda wishes to express its sincere thanks to all countries and international organizations that have, bilaterally and multi later ally, given us the support we need to promote our development. Rwanda is also very grateful to those countries and organizations for their goodwill and friendship, and we solemnly renew our commitment always to manage our economic assets wisely. In these difficult times we intend to be a reliable, business-like partner on whom the international community can rely as it endeavours to bring about greater well-being for the peoples of the world.
In the same spirit Rwanda pays a solemn tribute to all States, peoples and international institutions of good will, governmental or non-governmental, who are voluntarily investing their energies in the economic development and social progress of the poor regions of the world for the greater benefit of mankind as a whole. The misfortunes of the world cannot be summed up solely in terms of economic imbalances between the North and the South. There is a major crisis that will seriously burden the future of mankind and could even endanger life on Earth. It is the crisis arising from the heedless management of the ecological wealth of the world, which has been so disrupted by the industrial development of contemporary civilization.
An ecological crisis has already been declared? certain vital parameters show the excesses of our civilization but in terms of the destruction of natural resources and the accumulation of industrial waste. There has been disastrous management of much wealth. In this area Rwanda believes that the international community as a whole is involved and that a movement of international solidarity must come about if we are to mobilize all the resources we need to preserve a healthy, viable environment for human beings.
It is regrettable that at a time when there is general dismay following the sounding of the alarm with regard to the ozone layer, certain industrialized countries of the North are unscrupulously taking advantage of the present situation to dump their waste on African soil and poison our world. Once more Africa is a victim of drought and creeping desertification. Paradoxically it is also subject to floods and is struck by plagues of locusts. Sadly, natural disasters have affected many areas of Africa as we try to fight against traditional scourges such as desertification. The Republic of Rwanda appeals to the international community to give increased support to our continent in this regard in an effort to preserve our natural resources and our environment.	j

Special support of that kind is essential, and could be provided through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and be supplemented by bilateral programmes.
The programmes of industrial development, which make massive use of natural resources, should, more than in the past, enjoy an environmental component at both the technical study stage and the stage of implementation so that they can be integrated into resource-use plans.
The Republic of Rwanda expresses the hope that in this vital area of the environment the international community will mobilize the necessary intellectual and technical resources to produce solutions that will guarantee the survival of our planet. For our part, under the leadership of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Rwanda, Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana, who has made the preservation of the environment one of his top priorities in the programme of food self-sufficiency, Rwanda has undertaken significant actions in this area. Byway of example I might mention the national programme for struggle against erosion, our reforestation campaign, the national environmental strategy and the environmental plan of action - the last two being in the course of preparation.
In addition we have adopted a number of political end administrative measures such as the installation of community and development works - (IK UGANDA). He have a national day of the tree, agricultural competitions and prizes, and annual themes devoted to agricultural production. These various actions are aimed at providing incentives to and mobilizing the Rwandese people, encouraging them to participate in food production and to create a balance between production and population, 95 per cent of which lives in rural areas and depends entirely on the income and resources produced by agriculture.
With the population growing at the rate of 3.7 per cent, during the last two decades Rwanda has recorded significant achievements, notably the following: the production of potatoes rose from 109,621 tonnes in 1974 to 244,700 tonnes in 1983  21 per cent of the land of the country has been reforested, and 83 per cent has been covered by anti-erosion ditches from 1974 to 1986 the contribution of UNUGANDA community efforts to the national development efforts has been evaluated at 14,845,450,209 Rwanda francs.

The people of Rwanda has been able to make such achievements thanks to the tireless efforts and initiatives of President Habyarimana. Yet despite the results achieved with regard to protection of the environment and self-sufficiency in food, Rwanda, like other third-world countries, is facing many challenges that are hampering the improvement of its people's social and economic conditions.
Together with the serious economic concerns facing the international community - some of which 1 have just outlined - the entire world is torn politically by bloody tensions and fatal conflicts resulting from anachronistic situations of intolerance, colonialism, oppression, imperialism and racism. Violence reigns wherever those outmoded vices remain, wherever the sovereignty of peoples and the integrity of States are flouted, wherever an individual's dignity and human rights are trampled underfoot.
Open violence reigns and even grows in many parts of the world, despite nearly a half century of united Nations peace-making efforts. It reigns in the land of apartheid, where it propagates terror in southern Africa) it reigns in the Arab territories illegally occupied by Israel, in Lebanon and in parts of Latin America. The mission of the United Nations to ensure and promote international peace and security is all the more timely today, since one explosive situation gives way to another, and the sound of guns continues to echo in many parts of the world, destroying the energy necessary for the advancement of peoples and societies.
None the less, the Republic of Rwanda pays a resounding tribute to the United Nations and its specialized agencies for their tireless work in support of international understanding and harmony. Thanks to the united Nations and its noble role in promoting peace, the twentieth century is entering its final decade in a world-wide climate of detente, and there are genuine prospects for peace at the international level. It is not excessively optimistic to envisage the resolution of the political and military tensions that have long existed in the wake of the Second World War.
This climate of detente is due in large part to the fact that reason seems to have triumphed in relations between the Powers of the East and the West with respect to disarmament, even though much remains to be done before the nuclear threat is totally eliminated. The beneficial effects of that detente on the rest of the world are obvious, and the road we have travelled should be carefully mapped in order to record for ever our achievements and to ensure that we continue to march forward in the search for peace and security. In that connection, the international community has welcomed the progress made in many conflicts where the great Powers had been in more or less direct conflict. In southern Africa the Brazzaville and New York agreements were able to break the deadlock on Namibia and begin a process of reconciliation in Angola.
At this very moment - despite set-backs attributable to the South African forces of colonialist aggression, which call for the greatest vigilance on the part of the United Nations and the organization of African Unity (OAU) - the plan for the independence of Namibia is irreversibly under way under United Nations auspices.
In that connection, the Conference of Heads of State or Government of the organization of African Unity, which held its twenty-fifth regular session in July 1989, considered the status of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia. The Conference expressed its regret at the grave incidents of' April 1989 and stressed that they were a predictable consequence of the reduction in personnel of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. It stated its serious concern at the activities of   South African terrorists operating before our very eyes with the intention of compromising and derailing the November elections. It is incomprehensible that South Africa should openly and with impunity defy international conventions on Namibia as defined by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
Rwanda firmly supports the position of the OAU and calls on the General Assembly to take the decisions that can rectify the situation and guarantee truly democratic elections for our Namibian brothers, so that at the Assembly's forty-fifth session Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), can come to this rostrum as the one hundred sixtieth Member of the united Nations.
Regrettably, the international community seems to have grown used to the internal and external demands of the racist Pretoria regime and to the genocidal acts that have long been perpetrated by a handful of criminals against the black majority of that country. That indifference does not conceal the commercial interests of certain countries, for the sake of whose profits millions of people have been sacrificed and democracy hobbled. The Republic of Rwanda appeals to the free world to strengthen pressure of all kinds on the criminal Pretoria regime to make it normalize political and economic life in conformity with the universal principles of democracy and human dignity.
Apartheid is the height of institutionalised racism; it is an odious and inhuman political, social and economic regime* it is the utter denial of human dignity. It is a criminal, reactionary and degrading system which is doomed to disappear. In the OAU, in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and from this rostrum we have often condemned unreservedly Pretoria's terrorist, abject policy. The forty-fourth session gives us another opportunity to express our disgust and grave concern at the unspeakable crimes committed by the racist minority in South
Africa, and the physical, moral, social and economic harm it has been causing for more than 200 years. We vigorously deplore the notorious indifference of the murderous racist regime's economic, political and military partners with respect to comprehensive mandatory sanctions - those partners who would like to be viewed as the champions of democracy and the defenders of human dignity and human rights. Despite our disappointment, we appeal to the international community to increase its support for the liberation movements in that country, and we strongly support the convening in December next of a special session of the General assembly on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa.
With respect to the situation in Angola, Rwanda firmly supports current peace initiatives. That was why the President of the Republic of Rwanda personally participated in the talks held in Gbadolite in June 1989 on the commendable initiative of President Mobutu of Zaire. Rwanda appeals to all political leaders to support those peace initiatives so that the fraternal country of Angola may see the end of the civil war that has sundered it for more than 15 years and may finally devote its energy to healing its wounds and to achieving social and economic progress.
My country also reaffirms its support for the fraternal people of Mozambique, which for many years has been the victim of criminal attacks by REN AM 0, which is supported by the racist Government of South Africa. We renew our support for the Sahraoui people, which continues to be deprived of its right to self-determination and independence*, we welcome efforts by the OAD and the United Nations to formulate suitable modalities for the implementation of the peace plan for western Sahara.
Elsewhere in Africa tension and civil war persist, blocking the social and economic development of the peoples concerned. Rwanda deeply believes in the irrefutable virtues of dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes, and in the principle of the non-use of force, and we vigorously condemn terrorism and aggression, in keeping with international ethics and the spirit of non-alignment. The Republic of Rwanda welcomes the peace initiatives that have been taken in the extremely difficult context of these conflicts. We urge the parties concerned to use direct and fraternal dialogue, which is the only way to promote the dynamic of peace and security between peoples.
Rwanda has repeatedly expressed in international forums its support for peace and dialogue. This is a policy which we are seeking to turn into concrete fact at the sub regional, regional and international levels.
The state of war which has been tearing the Middle East apart for decades, leading to the martyrdom of the Palestinian people, and the devastation of Lebanon, which not so very long ago was prosperous but today has been ravaged, are distressing situations whose persistence brings shame on all mankind.
Having officially recognized the independent State of Palestine, proclaimed in Algiers in December 1988, Rwanda once again expresses its solidarity with the Palestinian people's cause and its dedication to peaceful and direct negotiations between the parties concerned. The only legitimate force, which we believe in, is the force of law and reason, for that is the only one that is compatible with peace and the dignity of men and peoples.
Although Rwanda, like other peace-loving countries, heaved a deep sigh of relief following the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the beginning of negotiations between the two parties, we are still concerned by the continuation of armed conflict in Afghanistan, after the much-lauded withdrawal of Soviet troops.  The United Nations, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and all the forces of mediation must do their utmost to put an end to this source of tension and fratricidal hatred. But if that is to be done, the belligerents must show good-will and reasonableness and must agree to sit down at the negotiating table.
In connection with the situation in Cambodia, we express our complete support for the process of mediation currently under way. We hope that the negotiations being conducted within the framework of the Paris Conference and at the level of the United Nations will continue and will lead very soon to balanced and lasting solutions.
On the same lines, we hope that the problems that are afflicting some countries in Latin America and making it an unstable region will soon be resolved. It is high time that all the forces there opted for peaceful negotiations and democracy, and that the forces of interference recognized that the States concerned have a legitimate, inalienable right to national sovereignty. In this context, Rwanda supports ail the peace initiatives and efforts at reconciliation in Latin America, particularly within the framework of the Contadora Group.
Mankind's recent history has left certain peoples with open wounds, and now the international community must devote itself to healing them. We of course have in mind past conflicts, from the ruins of which certain countries must work to rise and the spectre of which must be exorcised. But we have in mind also - and specifically - the continuing tragedy of the divisions that are tearing fraternal peoples apart. Iron curtains and other walls of hatred, shame and pain persist at various levels, pitting brothers of the same nation, the same people, against one another, for ideological reasons.
Rwanda constantly strongly encourages all efforts to ensure the peaceful reunification and independence of the Korean nation and the praiseworthy initiatives to bring about the lawful restoration of the unity of the German people.
In that respect, Rwanda has been following with optimism the negotiations on the question of Cyprus that have been conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, and we hope that they will continue to be guided wholly by the principles of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of States. We join other non-aligned countries in welcoming the Secretary-General's diligent efforts to promote constructive dialogue, the demilitarisation of Cyprus, and the immediate withdrawal of the forces of occupation and exploitation.
The wind of detente, which is blowing in the sky of international relations, and the prospects for world peace which it raises, will be described in the history books of mankind as the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream of all the peoples. The international community must take this unprecedented opportunity to strengthen peace and solidarity among men and must make full use of the provisions that exist and the actions that have been taken to support disarmament, nuclear demilitarisation, the reconversion of the oceans into zones of peace, the non-militarization of outer space, and the reduction of tensions wherever they exist.
In this vital area of disarmament, the many facets of which will once again - and more than ever before - be the focus of the General Assembly's attention at the present session, Rwanda wishes to express here unequivocally its unswerving support for negotiations aimed at the maximum, decisive mobilization of minds so that there will be the determination to put into effect all the stages of general and complete disarmament. In particular, we strongly urge the United States and the Soviet Union to preserve what has been accomplished by the dialogue that is under way in this sphere, to the great joy of the entire United Nations family, and to continue to the end to deserve the confidence they have aroused in the international community.
We are optimistic about the noble initiatives to ensure detente that have been undertaken between East and West. We welcome not only the general relaxation of tension which is gradually becoming evident in the world political climate, in respect of regional and local conflicts, but also the ushering in of a new era of democracy and freedom in the world, in particular in the Eastern countries.
In addition, it is imperative, in our view, that this process of detente be extended to the solution of the economic and social problems in the world - in particular the plight of the poorer countries. The North must become more keenly aware of the dangers posed by the iniquities in the world economic situation, which in their way are just as dangerous as the arms race or the deterioration of the environment.
A world dominated by a new ethic of peace; a world in which everyone stands together and from which the noise of guns and the nuclear threat as well as all forms of violence, terrorism and discrimination will be banished; a world that will be freed once and for all from the consequences of colonialism and racism and will be characterized by understanding, dialogue and co-operation: that world is within the reach of peoples of good will and is in our view the most natural aspiration of all men.
Rwanda earnestly hopes for the flourishing of detente and the ushering in of a new era of peace and equity and social and economic progress. We express again here our determination to work unreservedly for those goals in our internal policies and in our relations with the States that cherish the noble ideals of the great family of the United Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Rwanda has deep faith in the United Nations, which represents the most appropriate international body for the maintenance of the movement towards peace in the world and for the peaceful settlement of disputes. More than any other organization, the United Nations is empowered to lead the oppressed peoples to freedom and self-determination.
More than ever before, the United Nations must promote more just international co-operation in every area in accordance with the sovereign equality of States. It has recorded an impressive range of successes, particularly in the area of the maintenance of peace, for which it won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize, which reflects great honour on us all.
Rwanda supports the noble ideals of the United Nations and sincerely hopes that in order to ensure greater efficiency and success, the organization will always be scrupulous in working on the basis of realistic and realizable objectives. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the United Nations bodies devoted to the economic and social development of the world. Special thanks goes to those who are working tirelessly for the well-being of the most vulnerable groups - children and mother. That is why continuing efforts must be made to provide the necessary resources.
The Republic of Rwanda expects the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly to make great strides forward, and appeals to all Member States to further strengthen their cohesiveness and solidarity so that we may progress towards the realization of the ideals of our Charter, which are based more clearly than ever before on the vital need to establish a new, better balanced and more just international economic order that is fair to the traditionally disadvantaged countries of the third world. We believe that that is the most realistic and safest way to guarantee for all mankind a future of peace, security and full development.
","In that resolution the Heads of State or Governments of the OAU appealed to the international community substantially to increase the resources of the Programme, in particular within the framework of the International Development Association (IDA); to extend the Programme beyond 1990; to create additional facilities for financial assistance to intermediary-income African countries non-beneficiaries of the IDA; and to intensify efforts to mobilize resources of the North in support of the economic and social recovery of Africa. In the spirit of General Assembly resolution 43/27, urging our countries to increase their efforts to produce a viable and practical conceptual framework for an economic programme of structural adjustment, and in keeping with the objectives and strategies based on the Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos and on the United Nations programme of Action for Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, the latest Summit Meeting of the OAU has just adopted the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes (AAF SAP) for socio-economic recovery and transformation. We vigorously deplore the notorious indifference of the murderous racist regime's economic, political and military partners with respect to comprehensive mandatory sanctions - those partners who would like to be viewed as the champions of democracy and the defenders of human dignity and human rights. Rwanda supports the noble ideals of the United Nations and sincerely hopes that in order to ensure greater efficiency and success, the organization will always be scrupulous in working on the basis of realistic and realizable objectives. The Republic of Rwanda expects the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly to make great strides forward, and appeals to all Member States to further strengthen their cohesiveness and solidarity so that we may progress towards the realization of the ideals of our Charter, which are based more clearly than ever before on the vital need to establish a new, better balanced and more just international economic order that is fair to the traditionally disadvantaged countries of the third world."
44,1989,CAN,"ï»¿In view of your remarks, Mr. President, I am a little embarrassed but I would like to extend to you my congratulations and best wishes as you assume your important duties as President of the current session of the General Assembly. The wisdom and the understanding that you bring to this position is well suited to these historic times. I am also confident you will do great honour to the legacy left by your predecessor and my good friend, Dante Caputo. Before beginning my main remarks I want to comment on two particular developments of relevance to the United Nations. The first concerns the application of modern technology to the challenge of peace-keeping, in April of this year, Canada completed a comprehensive study the purpose of which was to explore the utility of all forms of aerial surveillance to the peace-keeping tasks now before the international community. The conclusion of this study was that these overhead technologies - satellite or airborne - could significantly increase the efficiency of peace-keeping operations and related verification endeavours. This study will be submitted to the United Nations for its consideration.
 I believe this is an important development both symbolically and as an achievement in its own right. It is the sort of pragmatic, concrete work necessary to allow the United Nations to handle its ever-expanding peace-keeping responsibilities more effectively, it also symbolizes one of the fundamental purposes of this Organization: harmonizing the wonders of modern technology to the tasks of peace-making and not war-making.
The second development on which I would like to comment is the readiness by Canada, if asked, to supplement the United Nations presence in Namibia by sending trained and respected police forces. Canada enthusiastically supported the idea that nations should help meet the urgent requirements for skilled policing in Namibia. We are ready to send members of our national force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who have played such a decisive and constructive role in our own history.
They were, in effect, Canada's first peace-keepers, in 1874, in one of the actions which made us a trans-continental nation, the North-west Mounted Police marched west across 1,000 miles to establish by their presence the rule of law in the Canadian west. They brought order, not force, and by their conduct established a respect that endures to this day and has made them one of the most admired police forces in the world. They would carry to Namibia not only their skills, hut their reputation as keepers of the peace.
This would be the first time in Canadian history that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has undertaken such a role and in order to be ready, their Commissioner has asked for 100 volunteers. So far, 2,000 members have responded to that call from a total force of over 14,000. We believe that Canadian Mounties, Who, more than a century ago, brought a universal respect for law and order to our own West can extend that tradition to Namibia, as that new nation finally comes of age. This is an unprecedented and challenging period in world affairs. On the one hand, there is real movement on problems that not long ago seemed intractable. That is true in southern Africa, in Indo-China, in parts of the Middle East and, most dramatically, in East-West relations.
At the same time, the sense of crisis becomes more acute. Our climate is changing, bringing drought or inundation or other threats to our very survival. New diseases develop. New technologies allow proliferation of the most deadly weapons. Terrorism becomes more widespread. What is common about these problems is that none of them can be solved by one nation acting alone, nor by one group of powerful nations combining their will.
In the past, we assumed the world could survive man's worst excesses. Now in an age of suitcase bombs, the AIDS pandemic, holes in the ozone layer, there is doubt about that elementary ability to survive. There is doubt, but not despair -indeed the opposite of despair, what marks this period in world affairs is an activism and a pragmatism which yield surprising results and they come together here in the United Nations.
We are entering an era where the words of the United Nations Charter must cease to be goals to which we aspire, they must become descriptions of our common actions. And the term 'United Nations' cannot simply be the name of our institution, it must become a statement of our common purpose.
Who, today, can imagine a nuclear war in which there are winners and losers? Who can envisage a conventional war in Europe which does not consume the prize? Who can construct a solution to the debt crisis which does not involve compromise? Mho can foresee a cleaner global environment without international co-operation and joint action? And who can imagine a resolution of the many crises in the developing world without a reasoned and productive dialogue with the developed world? In the past it was the adherents of unilateralism who were known as realists and the advocates of co-operation who were labelled idealists. I submit that the reverse is now the case. Co-operation is now the new realism and pragmatism is the path to progress. 
Much has been accomplished in recent months and years, much more remains to be done. Within the East-West relationship there is a new  willingness to abandon sterile linkages and to seek solutions to tractable problems even when other areas remain contentious. This welcome attitude has invigorated this institution and brought hope to many conflicts and regions of the world. We encourage its continuance.
Arms control is now characterized by real compromise and give and take. Problems which are truly acute are being addressed first. Areas where technology threatens to overtake politics are being given priority and the unnecessarily large and undesirably unstable balance in conventional forces is finally being dealt with head-on. Canada warmly welcomes the significant progress made in recent days by the United States and the Soviet Union on a variety of fundamental issues. In particular, movement towards the abandonment of the linkage between research on strategic defence and progress on strategic nuclear arms control is a very positive development. So too is the progress registered on eliminating chemical weapons, including the exchange of data on stocks. We strongly welcome President Bush's offer to reduce stockpiles to less than 20 per cent of current levels while efforts continue in Geneva to negotiate a chemical weapons convention.
Canada endorses also the United States and Soviet agreement to explore an open-skies arrangement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. Such an arrangement would be daring in its simplicity, yet path-breaking in its consequences: an agreement that the aircraft of each member of both alliances could enter the airspace of the other alliance subject only to basic air-safety regulations. That would increase the assurance of every member that military activities were not becoming preparations for surprise attack.
From the beginning, we have urged the United States to move forward with this visionary proposal, and to make it an alliance-to-alliance arrangement. An open-skies agreement would be a compelling symbol of the new East-West relationship, it would build confidence and serve as a useful vehicle for the verification of other agreements, including an eventual agreement on conventional forces in Europe.
We are prepared to go beyond moral support. On Sunday, after consultations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Prime Minister Mulroney announced Canada's offer to act as host to an inter-alliance conference as early as November, in order to explore the possibilities of a formal agreement on open-skies.
 It is of fundamental importance to deepen and widen East-West relations. A stable structure of peace cannot endure if its only component is concurrence on arms control, no matter how far-reaching that agreement might be. Enduring peace requires understanding, a sense of shared problems and a shared stake in the future. Above all, it demands a sense on each side that the survival of the other is in its own best interests. What is required is agreement not only on the avoidance of war but also on the advantages of peace. Therefore we welcome and encourage the broadening dialogue on regional, economic, social and environmental matters.
It is for that reason that Canada has strongly supported expanding the field of activity of NATO to pursue more energetically the alliance's mandate for political and social dialogue. In that connection, during NATO's most recent summit, a Canadian proposal was adopted to assist young political leaders in learning how to make democracy work. More initiatives of that type are required.
The progress in East-West relations owes much to the refreshing breezes of change sweeping Eastern Europe and the USSR, ideology is giving way to compromise. Governments are recognizing that the old ways do not work, that new strategies are required, that lessons may be learned abroad, and that co-operation in the economic and social spheres does not constitute an acknowledgement of defeat but is rather a recipe for success.
Canada's support for the changes now underway in the East is unequivocal. There must be no turning back, and that requires imagination in the West as to practical ways to strengthen the remarkable process of reform and liberalization. In the Eastern bloc and elsewhere around the world, the turning towards democracy and the expansion of the market-place is a welcome victory for pragmatism and realism. Totalitarianism is fading not because it is regarded by its subjects as wrongs it is being discredited because it does not work, it does not deliver.
Democracy is not only a set of values, it is also a statement that there is no monopoly on truth, that different groups at different times may have different solutions to different problems. It is the politics of pragmatism, it works. It delivers, a free market is not simply a particular means of ordering the economy. It is a framework that enables the individual to act on his or her own merits. efforts, and capacities, it conforms to human nature. It is the economics of pragmatism, it works, it delivers, it is for that reason that Canada welcomes the tide of democratization and the shift to the market-place evident around the globe. On that trend rests the hope for social stability. And such stability is a firm foundation for international peace.
The past months have seen remarkable progress in many regional conflicts that have posed serious threats to global stability and caused untold sorrow for their victims. The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the settlements in Angola and Namibia, the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and the progress evident in Central America: all are testimony to a new willingness to compromise. They are also testimony to the crucial role played by the Organization end by its Secretary-General in the search for global order. Much more needs to be done. There is a difference between the absence of war and the presence of peace. The international community must continue to do everything in its power to ensure that the processes now underway in those troubled regions move from truce to settlement, from stand-off to stand-down.
We believe it is particularly important to maintain the pressure against apartheid. There are real reasons for encouragement. President de Klerk has promised reform and has demonstrated both flexibility and imagination. The African National Congress has shown courage and foresight in preparing itself to participate in genuine negotiations, popular demonstrations in South Africa, and their tolerance by the authorities, reflect a popular will that reaches across colour. International attention and the use and threat of sanctions have contributed to this climate of change, and they must not be relaxed until substantial reform is in place. 
Even today, children starve and adults perish as old conflicts born of hatred and greed continue to fester, cheating future generations and defiling the honour of ancient civilizations. In Lebanon, blood continues to be spilt in a tragic struggle for domination in that once noble land, while is now being destroyed by those who would be its ruler. We renew the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and reiterate our strong support for the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League. In the Middle East, there is an urgent need for confidence and dialogue. We support Israel's proposals for direct elections in the occupied territories, we welcome the moderation evident in the positions of the Palestine Liberation Organization. But much more confidence-building is needed on both sides if these initial gestures are to be translated into a meaningful peace process for that troubled and war-ravaged region. Canada welcomes President Mubarak's imaginative 10-point plan as one avenue out of the current impasse.
And in Cambodia, the recent International Conference in Paris failed to Produce an agreement, owing to many outstanding difference between the parties. It is to be hoped that the future will bring compromise before that land endures yet another bloody conflict. However, I believe the Paris Conference served a positive Purpose: it has put the issue firmly on the international agenda and identified international control mechanisms and reconstruction processes that can be brought into play when a settlement is reached. As some regional conflicts have been brought under control, the unique and important United Nations instrument of peace-keeping has been brought to bear. At the same time, welcome and pragmatic suggestions are being made to improve operations and funding. Canada supports the Secretary-General's call to provide Peace-keeping with a rational and secure funding base. Peace-keeping has become too important to the mission of the Organization to be subject to charity or whim.

One of the central tasks of this Organization has been to weave a new fabric of international law. This it has done assiduously, often without fanfare. The foundation is being laid for an international society governed by legal principles and codes of conduct. As with domestic society, stability is not possible without law, and law is powerless without consensus. The integration into domestic law of the rights codified by the United Nations in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the covenants on racial discrimination and the rights of women is testimony to a growing international consensus. We must build on this success by acting this year to approve the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
We are witnessing today a profound transformation in the substance of international discourse. Issues once thought intractable are now remarkably close to resolution. And issues once considered the province of domestic governments are now the focus of international activity. These are on the international agenda because they are pressing and because no State, no matter how powerful or well- intentioned, can resolve them on its own.
Thus the environment is emerging as the most important international challenge of the remainder of this century and the next. In a very few years, the environment will be seen as a threat to human existence in the same way as nuclear war has been regarded in the past. It is now a challenge to national survival. It is also an area where the distinction between the domestic and the international agenda is collapsing. Pollution knows no borders. In the end, we all share the same air and water-, we all suffer from its corruption or its loss.
Let us agree during this session of the Assembly to hold the proposed Conference on the Environment and development in 1992. Let us move forward towards a convention on climate change with regard to which Canada has played a leading role in the development of a United Nations draft. And let us start a realistic dialog between the developed and the developing world on the environmental scourge which threatens all states, rich and poor. I detect today a new and welcome change in the stale and unproductive state of relations between North and South which marked the 1970s and the first part of this decade. There is growing recognition that grand. vague visions must give way to pragmatic dialogue, and that attribute, blame does little to solve problems.  
In fact, without fanfare, without grand initiative, a new process of dialogue has already begun between the developed and the developing world. In the Cairns Group, diverse entries such as Canada and Thailand, Australia and Argentina have joined together on agricultural issues. international financial institutions, the debt crisis is being approached with a new spirit of realism and a sense of shared risk. Economic prescriptions are now plain, married with political and social considerations. This sensitivity is required if fledgling democracies and fragile societies are not to collapse over the wrenching effect of debt repayments. In the Commonwealth, a multiracial and global membership has allowed for increasing pressure against apartheid. In La Froncophonie, new programmes to preserve the French heritage and promote distance-learning are emerging, and human rights are now on the agenda for the first time. And within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, there is a refreshing determination to put ideology aside and seek practical co-operation with the developed world. I attended the Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade as a guest. I did so in search of common ground on a variety of international Issues. 1 was pressed by the new spirit of moderation shown by many makers, as I was by the wise and deft chairmanship of Yugoslavia. I quote from their Final Declaration:
 We are not to be burdened with prejudice or dogma.' I attended the Summit Conference not because Canada is questioning its alliances - we are a proud and permanent member of NATO and we are committed to a market economy and liberal democracy - rather, I attended because Canada happens to share a world with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.
At Belgrade, I took the opportunity to explore further the proposal made by India, Egypt, Senegal and Venezuela during the Paris economic summit for a serious and responsive dialogue on issues of concern to us all. Canada, along with France, supported that proposal in principle at Paris. I reiterate that support now, and suggest some variations that may make the concept more effective. we should all learn from the mistakes of our past, set aside our differing world views, and come together, collectively and calmly, to discuss particular problems those resolution we all seek.
Canada believes it is useful to encourage intensive consultations leading to a new conversation between the developed and the developing world, a conversation on focused issues, with a view to arriving at joint action for a common cause. Conversation, not confrontation. We cannot remake the world. But we can - and we must - redress the errors of the past - methodically, pragmatically, realistically and collectively.
Discussions on the environment, on drugs, on investment, on trade, on debt, are all worthy of early pursuit. The agenda should be balanced, covering issues of interest to both the developed and developing world, we will be pursuing this question actively in the months ahead with our G-7 partners and the developing world, soviet involvement in this effort would be welcome, giving them the opportunity to act further on their interest in contributing to the international order, it would also reflect the universal nature of this challenge.

In this connection, the coming year will provide two opportunities to encourage this new dialogue: the special session on the revitalization of Growth and Development-, and the elaboration of the fourth international development strategy. These two events can contribute to a new understanding of the basis for sustained economic growth and development, particularly for developing countries. 
The challenge before us today is to alter our traditional behaviour at an unprecedented rate, faced as we are with a planet showing so many signs of use and abuse. We know only too well the litany of global horrors before us: a burgeoning global population whose size will expand by almost 3.5 billion in 35 short years-, an ailing environment whose forests are dying or disappearing, whose air is being poisoned, and whose oceans and rivers are becoming dump-sites and cesspools; 14 million children dying each year from common illness and poor nutrition? a generation debilitated by drugs, the world trade in which now exceeds the value of trade in oil and is second only to the arms trade-, dozens of economies unable to pay simultaneously for past mistakes and develop a successful future; the proliferation of weapons - chemical and nuclear, as well as the spreading technology of weapon-delivery systems - creating a time-bomb which threatens the relief we now feel at the new-found co-operation of the super-Powers.
This Organization, like other international assemblies, reflects the world from which it draws its Members and its mission. There have been many successes: the quiet but spectacular victories of UNICEF, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Health Organization; the triumph of peace-keeping, 50,000 participants in which so deservedly received the Nobel Peace Prize; the mediation of disputes, so honourably presided over by the present Secretary-General. But there have also been failures, opportunities lost to dated ideology and the lack of political will. The challenge posed by the future is not to invent new institutions but to make this United Nations family of institutions work more effectively and humanely. 
We are in a new type of race, one in which we will either all be winners or we will all be losers Let us lay to rest the worn out stereotypes of the past. Let us ,	put aside our differences and work forth-rightly for a secure global future. Let us consecrate ourselves anew as united Nations. And let us confront squarely the problems of our era as men and women aware of the challenges before us, mindful of the consequences of failure, and dedicated to solutions that will work, not to dreams that will die.
","It is the sort of pragmatic, concrete work necessary to allow the United Nations to handle its ever-expanding peace-keeping responsibilities more effectively, it also symbolizes one of the fundamental purposes of this Organization: harmonizing the wonders of modern technology to the tasks of peace-making and not war-making. We believe that Canadian Mounties, Who, more than a century ago, brought a universal respect for law and order to our own West can extend that tradition to Namibia, as that new nation finally comes of age. Areas where technology threatens to overtake politics are being given priority and the unnecessarily large and undesirably unstable balance in conventional forces is finally being dealt with head-on. An open-skies agreement would be a compelling symbol of the new East-West relationship, it would build confidence and serve as a useful vehicle for the verification of other agreements, including an eventual agreement on conventional forces in Europe. The international community must continue to do everything in its power to ensure that the processes now underway in those troubled regions move from truce to settlement, from stand-off to stand-down."
44,1989,ALB,"ï»¿
On behalf of the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, I have the pleasure to address to you, Sir, the representative of a friendly African nation, our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the current session of the General Assembly.
I would also extend my congratulations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, on his efforts and his commitment to strengthening the role of the United Nations in coping with the acute problems of our time in the cause of peace and security.
The Albanian delegation, like the delegations of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations, has come to this session of the General Assembly with the sincere desire to join its efforts with those of other States for the improvement of the international atmosphere and the promotion of international security. There is no doubt that an open and constructive debate free of reservations and preconceptions about present world developments would contribute to the success of this debate. The Albanian delegation believes that the present-day international situation is complex. In many cases, developments are as contradictory as they are fluid and unstable. They are characterized by a relaxation of tension in some areas and an increase in others, while the settlement of a problem in one region is accompanied by the emergence and exacerbation of problems in another. The current political dialogue in the relations between the two super-Powers, which has found concrete expression in their agreements on a number of minor arms reductions or in their steps to eliminate certain hot-beds of regional conflict, have led to a relative easing of tension. Efforts are frequently made to portray this as a qualitative change in present-day international relations or as an irreversible trend towards international peace and security, a new era. But past experience and present developments force us to recognize that the present relaxation of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union is no guarantee that threat of war has been eliminated. Today, interference in the internal affairs of others has increased under various pretexts and threatens to upset the balance, with incalculable consequences.
Albania is in favour of improving the atmosphere and easing the tension in Europe. It is for peace and the strengthening of security cm our continent. The ways these problems are regarded and the paths leading to their solution may differ from State to State, but it is essential that the policy and concrete actions of each of these States help to attain that goal. We feel that Albania, by pursuing a fully independent policy outside all blocs and permitting no foreign bases and troops on its territory, has done and continues to serve the cause of security and peace in Europe.
In the field of disarmament, too, the agreements between the two super-Powers are minimal and have not affected the enormous arsenals of weapons of every sort in their possession. Declarations of impressive proposals and counter-proposals concerning deep cuts of up to 50 per cent in strategic weapons cannot conceal the arms race, which continues, or the manufacture of new generations of ever more modern and sophisticated weapons. So true is this that we now have good reason to state that the dividing line between the dangers of nuclear arms and the dangers of conventional arms has almost disappeared. We believe that the problems of disarmament can be confronted and set on the road to solution through the collective and individual efforts and actions of all States.
At a time when the arms race continues, when hot-beds of tension and crisis persist, the interests of peace call for the adoption of effective measures towards disarmament, the dismantling of political and military blocs, the removal of foreign bases and the return of foreign armies within their national borders, and the cessation of all interference in the internal affairs of other States.
Prom time to time the super-Powers set forth new theories and political doctrines, as well as ideas and models, which they seek to impose on others, presenting them as almost universal criteria for the development of democratic processes, and which they attempt to establish, in one way or another, as pre-conditions for relations between States. Albania maintains that peoples and States must be free to choose their own paths to sovereign development, to preserve their national identity, and to play their rightful role in the course of world events.
Albania is and always has been in favour of a democratisation of international relations that would allow all States, large and small, to make their voices heard. In light of that necessity, the role of the United Nations in international affairs becomes even more significant. As the experience of the past two or three years has shown, the commitment of the United Nations to solving certain critical problems is an indication of the potentials and importance it can have when it plays its true role in accordance with the Charter. We believe that the important problems of our time should not be left for discussion by only a narrow circle of States or to a dialogue by the super-Powers; rather, they must be brought to the United Nations. That would confirm the weight and power of the international community.
It is certainly in the international community's interest to avoid regional crises and conflicts, since these constitute hot-beds of tension exacerbated and manipulated by others against the interests of the peoples. Thus, it is the parties directly involved and concerned in these conflicts and crises, and not external forces, that should play the decisive roles in settling them. Short-term solutions, especially those imposed from without, cannot endure. In our view, the formula of 'national reconciliation', applied under the tutelage of the super-Powers, leaves the door open for interference and destabilization; the case of Afghanistan is an example of that. In the interests of independent development and peace, interference in Central America and South-East Asia must cease, and the solutions to their problems must conform to the aspirations of the peoples concerned. Similarly, the Korean people must not be prevented from achieving the reunification of its homeland free from outside interference.
As a Mediterranean country, Albania considers that any step towards the creation of a favourable political climate in the Mediterranean requires the withdrawal of the super-Powers' fleets and warships. That step would help to make it a sea of peace and friendship among the peoples of the countries that border on it, and a bridge of co-operation with the other regions of the world.
When we speak of the Mediterranean, we cannot help thinking of Lebanon, which is living through a veritable tragedy. Israel and the forces of reaction have imposed on it a lengthy fratricidal war with extremely serious consequences. It is for the Lebanese people itself to establish its own national unity in all sovereignty. In the Middle East, the Arab peoples have been fighting against imperialist-Zionist aggression for several decades. Standing out in that context is the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people, bearing living witness to the dauntless efforts of a valiant people that cannot be conquered by violence or tanks, nor by the genocide practised by those that commit aggression against it.
The Albanian people and Government have always felt close to the fraternal Arab peoples and their just struggle. We regard the proclamation of the Palestinian State and its international recognition as a very important development, offering greater possibilities for the settlement of that key problem in the Middle East. The uprising of the Palestinian people - the intifadah - which has been going on for nearly two years in the occupied territories, enjoys the unreserved support of the Albanian people as a legitimate struggle. The Albanian people has also hailed the positive steps towards the strengthening of unity in the Arab world, which it considers to be a decisive factor in the just settlement of the Palestinian problem and of the Middle East crisis as a whole.
Against the background of developments and endeavours to achieve political settlements of conflicts and hotbeds of tension the cease-fire agreement in Angola and the agreement on the granting independence to Namibia cannot fail to have a considerable impact on the over-all situation in the southern part of the African continent. The Albanian delegation condemns the violence and crimes of the South African regime, which continues to persist in its detested colonialist policy of racial discrimination.
The Albanian people support the African countries in their just struggle against imperialist neo-colonialist exploitation. We associate ourselves with the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to strengthen its unity in support of the struggle of the Azanian people to put an end to the hated apartheid regime in South Africa, an anachronism in the modern world that constitutes a challenge to all mankind. Looking back over the development of events in the world since the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, we witness an intensification of internal contradictions in a number of countries, the negative consequences of which extend far beyond national borders. Multinational States, which are a reality in today's world, cannot speak of genuine democracy so long as they fail to achieve democratic relations among the nations, nationalities and minorities that comprise them, if an aggravation of inter-ethnic relations is being observed today, that shows that in those States ethnic or national issues have not been properly addressed.
Albania has always maintained that minorities, wherever they may be, should enjoy equal rights with the rest of a country's population, in keeping with the norms of international law. We have always maintained that minorities should be important factors for rapprochement and friendship between peoples and States. Recently a process of co-operation has begun among the countries of the Balkans. The meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Balkan States that was held last year has been followed by a number of other activities of a political, economic, scientific and technical character. That process constitutes a positive trend that reflects the fundamental interests of the peoples of the peninsula and the cause of peace in the region and in all of Europe. The peoples of our peninsula aspire to and need peace and understanding, co-operation and friendship, and not destabilization and mutual animosity.
The Albanian Government will work tirelessly to ensure that that process does not come to a halt but that it is, instead, advanced and consolidated. We hope and we wish that the other Balkan countries will do likewise, overcoming certain recent developments that run counter to the spirit of understanding and to the commitments undertaken within the context of Balkan co-operation.
Albania has never interfered - nor does it intend to interfere - in the internal affairs of other States. However, prompted by a sincere concern about the fostering of Balkan co-operation and confidence, as well as out of a sense of moral justice and on the basis of democratic and other humane considerations enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in other international instruments, my country cannot fail to mention the tragic events that occurred in Kosovo in the spring of this year, along with the repression of the Albanians and their national democratic rights, events that continue today and that are in defiance of every norm of freedom, of democracy and of social and cultural emancipation. The Albanian Government and people - along with world public opinion, including that of sound Yugoslav circles - have condemned and continue to condemn the killing and imprisonments of hundreds of thousands of Albanians who are calling for equality and for the same rights as are enjoyed by fellow-citizens in their federal state and for the retention of their autonomy, language, culture and national traditions.
White papers or yellow literature may be produced, but they cannot justify the fact that the law in Kosovo is made by tanks and policeman or that, following the constitutional amendments, the number of Albanian schools has been reduced aid the Kosovo intellectuals and youth are being persecuted. The so-called differentiation, which in fact constitutes isolation, an unprecedented and inhuman moral, economic and political boycott, has affected the best-known intellectuals, academicians and teachers, down to the school-children themselves.
Albania has been and remains directly concerned to ensure the stabilization of the situation in Yugoslavia, since the freedom and independence of both countries are linked. Any evil in one country affects the other. The normalization of the situation in Kosovo, the national and economic emancipation of the Albanians in Yugoslavia, where they make up an entity of some 3 million inhabitants, and recognition of their equality of rights with the other national groups and nationalities of the Federation, would serve to strengthen Yugoslavia itself.
The interests of the peoples of the region require that the bitter legacy of the past be overcome and that no new difficulties be added; instead, real efforts should be made to improve the friendly atmosphere and to strengthen fruitful co-operation. As has been announced, in the autumn of next year the second meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan States will be held in Albania. It is our desire that, through the concerted efforts of all States of the region, facing up to present-day realities, that important meeting will mark a new and more advanced stage in our work towards multilateral co-operation and strengthened relations of good-neighbourliness. We are sure that that will be the case. We regard good-neighbourliness as the expression of mutual obligations and of the desire and interests of our peoples and countries to live in peace aid friendship with one another. Albania, which has sincerely committed itself to the process of Balkan co-operation, regards it as a realistic alternative for strengthening peace in the region. It considers that, as a part of Europe, the Balkans, which has suffered so much from feuds, upheavals and wars, needs peace, tranquillity and stability today more than ever in order to overcome the bitter past and the region's relative backwardness when compared with the rest of the continent, as well as to demonstrate our region's interest in, and contribution to, the development of positive European processes compatible with peace.
An important aspect of the democratisation of international relations which is making itself felt greatly today is that of economic relations or. the world scale. Inequality in trade exchanges, the imposition of protectionist measures and tariff barriers and the widespread use of the loan mechanism by the developed industrial countries have widened the economic gap between them and the developing countries. The fact that this situation persists and is worsening is directly affecting the stability of international relations, in which economic relations - more so today than ever before -- are inseparably intertwined with political relations.
It is not easy to understand appeals for detente and for the strengthening of international security when some industrialized countries are becoming richer and richer by exploiting developing countries, among others, and the developing countries are becoming poorer every day. Nowadays, when the question of human rights has become a subject for concern and a burning issue to the extent that it has become politicised in the extreme, even in cases which involve individuals, can one really put any faith in the concern expressed when a blind eye is turned to the fate of the millions of people in various parts of the world under threat of famine? The demands of the developing countries - which are frequently referred to as the 'poor men's club' although they represent an overwhelming majority of United Nations Member States - for equality to be established in international economic relations are legitimate, should be heard out and proper answer made to them. 

The illicit trafficking in and the use of drugs have now become a social problem and social evil in many countries. The phenomenon has never occurred in Albania and is not occurring there now. A healthy tradition and educational measures apart, the State, through strict laws, provides for severe punishments for the illegal use, possession and sale of narcotics. At the same time, Albania has taken steps to block any possible traffic in drugs throughout its territory. We think that the fight against drugs should not be used as a cover for particular political designs.
In our time, ecological problems have become extremely acute, and the danger resulting from the pollution of the environment has increased even more. It is now an acknowledged fact that the most serious ecological damage due to pollution on the world scale is being caused by the super industrialized countries, which are the greatest consumers and processors of raw materials. The concern in this regard is all the greater when one is aware that some of these countries are dumping their technological wastes, some with radioactive content, in developing countries.
Albania, which is itself demonstrating the greatest concern to protect the environment within its own territory, including the Adriatic region, joins with those other countries which are rightly demanding that those who are most responsible for pollution should feel obliged to improve the situation and solve the problem.
For the Albanian people, which has had a centuries-long struggle for its territory, freedom and existence, the safeguarding of its independence and full national sovereignty is sacred. With the principle of independence at the foundation of its policy, Albania has at the same time made its modest contribution to the cause of peace and security. It has established and maintains fair, fruitful and friendly relations with the great majority of countries, which is why our country has felt and still feels that it is an integral and active part of the international community.
The reality of Albania in the 45 years since Liberation and the changes and progress made in many areas are the happy outcome of the socialist course it has taken. The fact that the population has tripled over these four decades while average life expectancy has increased from 38 years at Liberation to 72 years today is proof of the far-reaching economic and social changes that have been made in my country.
We are well aware that, despite everything our people has done in Albania through the labour of its hands and the sweat of its brow, we are not at the end of the road, but the important thing is that we are convinced that our road is the right one and opens up to us the prospect of continued progress.
Wishing that the work of this Assembly should be conducted in the most constructive spirit possible and to the benefit of peace, the Albania, delegation will not fail to make its contribution towards attaining this goal.
","Prom time to time the super-Powers set forth new theories and political doctrines, as well as ideas and models, which they seek to impose on others, presenting them as almost universal criteria for the development of democratic processes, and which they attempt to establish, in one way or another, as pre-conditions for relations between States.

44,1989,GRC,"ï»¿
On behalf of my Government, I wish at the outset to extend warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are indeed deeply satisfied that a most distinguished representative of Nigeria, a country with which Greece maintains traditionally the closest relations of friendship and co-operation, has been elected by acclamation to this prestigious office. Your vast experience in the work of the Organization and the leadership and diplomatic skills you have displayed ensure that you will discharge with success the duties with which you are entrusted. I take this opportunity also to assure you that we recall most vividly your last visit to Athens, when as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid you co-chaired the symposium entitled 'Culture against apartheid'.
I avail myself of this opportunity to express to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, former Foreign Minister of Argentina, our deep appreciation for the able and inspired manner in which he guided with great effectiveness the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
My personal thoughts turn also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, to whom I wish to express my admiration for his untiring efforts in efficiently leading the United Nations in its task of maintaining international peace and security. I wish to congratulate him on the report on the work of the Organization he recently presented to us. His review of international developments brings home, in bold and lucid terms, the acuteness of tensions in areas where violence and injustice are, unfortunately, still the norm in the everyday life of peoples and countries - all this against a growing consciousness that the United Nations can be more effective in the prevention of conflicts and the suppression of acts of aggression. In short, he has presented 'a credible strategy of peace'.
Earlier this week the Foreign Minister of France, Mr. Roland Dumas, in his capacity as President of the European Economic Community, made a statement on behalf of the 12 States Members of the European Community. My Government fully concurs with the views expressed on issues that are central to our concerns and to our aspirations. For my part, I should like also to point to the new hopes raised in Europe in the wake of a historic evolution which should, we hope, lead to the elimination of confrontations and to the attenuation of divisions. It is that same Europe, which, as the Secretary-General does not fail to mention, was plunged 50 years ago this very month into a most savage and destructive conflict, which eventually engulfed other continents. Greece survived that holocaust, devastated but with an unshakable faith in democracy, human dignity and justice, the very purposes and principles of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter.
The openness and restructuring that are defining current developments in Eastern and Central Europe constitute a political event of historical dimensions. Relief of unparalleled importance has been brought forward in the theatre of European relations, affecting overall world affairs. Greece has contributed actively to this process which marks a turning point in the relations between East and West on the European continent. We are convinced that confidence can replace mistrust and that co-operation should replace confrontation. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has played a major role in creating an advanced stage of co-operation among the 35 participating States. The Concluding Document issued at its last Session in Vienna, marks an important step in the Helsinki process. The Forum of Information, held in London, and the Conference on the Human Dimension, held in Paris more recently, give the measure of the further progress achieved in two most sensitive areas. Within the framework of 'die process established by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, regional co-operation in the Balkan peninsula has been a most significant development. My country takes satisfaction from the fact that it was the first to propose the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act on a regional basis. Since then, we have been consistently committed to the advancement of this co-operation with our Balkan neighbours, seeking to enlarge the range of areas of common interest. Following the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the six Balkan countries in Belgrade last year, a series of specialized meetings have been organized consecutively in various capitals. An important meeting of high officials is planned to take place in Athens in the coming months. We shall spare no effort towards the furtherance of this process, which serves peace and stability in our region. As regards neighbouring Turkey, we would like to develop in our relations a climate enabling us to establish in the near future a serious dialogue that would bring us to an era of peace, friendship and co-operation.
Efforts leading to nuclear and conventional disarmament remain at the centre of our preoccupations. These efforts, primarily deployed in the framework of the United Nations system, are obviously influenced by the progress of bilateral talks between the two nuclear super-Powers. The Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - concluded in December 1987, and the negotiations for the reduction by 50 per cent of their respective nuclear arsenals, have a direct bearing on the general relaxation in international tensions. In Europe again, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (GSCE) remains the most efficient negotiating framework for conventional disarmament. We earnestly look forward to the success of negotiations initiated recently in Vienna aiming at the reduction of such weapons in Europe, and also to an agreement on a new set of confidence- and security-building measures.
Beyond the confines of European initiatives, we look forward to a successful conclusion of the negotiations for the prohibition of chemical weapons carried out within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The United Nations should continue to provide to the international community the institutional framework for disarmament negotiations. Without being unduly pessimistic, we should place in their true dimensions both the seemingly fruitless results of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and the more inconclusive last session of the Disarmament Commission.
If, in the words of the Secretary-General, 'the United Nations needs to demonstrate its capacity to function as guardian of world security', its Member States should be conscious - as indeed they are - of the true nature of regional conflicts as well as of the nature of the solutions achieved, or to be achieved. In a tightly interdependent world, no regional problem loses its international character, the more so when the Organization is seized of it. The involvement of the United Nations suggests that the extent to which it can contribute toward solutions greatly depends on the existence of a genuine political will for the maintenance of peace and security by the parties directly concerned. The most notable examples in this respect are the agreement between Iran and Iraq for a cease-fire in the region of the Gulf following resolution 598 (1987), unanimously adopted by the Security Council, the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan and the New York agreements on Namibia signed in December 1988. A few years earlier, these problems seemed to be insoluble. However, diplomatic skill and patience, in parallel with the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, but primarily with the efforts of the parties directly involved, have brought to an end the military conflict between Iran and Iraq. We express the hope that both parties will co-operate intensively with the Secretary-General on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).
The same skill and patience has produced an agreement for the withdrawal of foreign military forces from Afghanistan. Similarly, it has brought about agreements for the disengagement of alien forces and other elements from Namibia and from Angola, in the framework of an overall solution designed in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). However, we are still deeply concerned that in the regions just mentioned the agreements reached, or the peace plans and other arrangements pursued, have not yet come to full fruition and have not as yet succeeded in eliminating grave internal problems. National reconciliation is at stake in Afghanistan and local conditions are far from giving hope for an early return of the refugees to their homes in safety and honour.
In Namibia, we have been following with some concern the strenuous efforts of the United Nations to establish normal conditions to secure free and fair elections in time for the agreed date, early November 1989, as well as for the return of refugees. The plight of prisoners of war still held by the former belligerents in the region of the Gulf, where other serious problems have still to be resolved, delays the implementation of the settlement plan laboriously pursued by the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative.
Greece is following with particular interest developments in South Africa, where the situation continues, regretfully, to endanger peace, security and stability in the area. The state of emergency is still in force throughout the country, while sporadic positive developments, such as the release of a number of political detainees, fall short of constituting the fundamental change that the situation requires. Anti-apartheid organizations are still banned and harassed, and their activities are restricted by all kinds of repressive measures. We hope that recent developments in that country will lead to the complete and peaceful eradication of apartheid by an effective national dialogue across political, religious and colour distinctions, with a view to establishing a free, democratic and non-racial South Africa.
In Central America, the Esquipulas II agreement and the recent Tela agreements supported by the Presidents of the five countries of the region lead us to hope that agreements to terminate military activities from one territory to another, to end internal strife and to guarantee the democratic process will be crowned with success. Observer groups to be eventually established by the United Nations to verify and control the peace process under way nay be part of a substantial contribution by this Organization. In Kampuchea, in the Western Sahara and, last but not least, in the Middle East, the impasse persists, and the United Nations has not yet been in a position to enhance effectively a few positive steps taken in any of the cases mentioned. The inconclusive results of the Paris Conference on Cambodia do not prevent us from noting that the Vietnamese forces seem to be keeping to their timetable of withdrawal. The peace plan presented by the Secretary-General to the opposing parties in the Western Sahara still remains a valid proposal for a just and lasting agreement. However, the persistence of Israel in occupying since 1967 Palestinian and other Arab territories, including East Jerusalem, aggravates the already harsh conditions of life of the civilian population in the occupied territories and remains the main obstacle to a just solution in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We believe that the settlement of the Middle Eastern question can be reached by the convening of the International Peace Conference under the auspices of the United Nations, leading to talks in which all the directly interested parties should participate, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
We are deeply concerned by the tragic conditions prevailing in Lebanon. We call upon all parties to refrain from the use of force and to reach, through peaceful negotiations, a solution that will guarantee the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of this country. We are particularly satisfied that the plan of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League appears to have been accepted, thus paving the way for the return of peace in that country, torn for so many years by internal strife.

With regard to the Korean Peninsula, we welcome President Roh's new unification formula as well as any proposal aiming at reducing tension in the area. The South Korean Government has our support and encouragement in its efforts to promote unification through peaceful and democratic means. A brief review of cases regarding regional conflicts inevitably brings forward a pattern on which the United Nations is invited to act or is acting, in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.
This pattern of United Nations involvement leads us to take note of two distinct levels of action encompassing each problem as a whole. The first level of action refers to the external aspect of a problem, which as a rule is relevant to the prevention or termination of an armed confrontation, the withdrawal of foreign military forces of occupation or foreign elements alien to a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated. The second level of action normally relates to the internal aspect of a regional problem, which, as previous examples clearly denote, consists of internal strife and the need for national reconciliation, the settlement of refugee problems, and the enforcement of human rights and the rule of law. In varying degrees, as circumstances in each case dictate, the United Nations is called upon, usually through the good offices of the Secretary-General, to assist in the settlement of a conflict, acting at the two distinct levels I have just mentioned.
Allow me now to refer in a more extensive way to the Cyprus problem, the persistence of which is of special concern to Greece and to the United Nations as a whole.
It is evident that for the last 15 years there has been a manifest lack of will on the Turkish side to reach a solution that would allow the two communities of Cyprus to enjoy the full fruits of independence to their mutual benefit. The Turkish invasion of 1974 and the continuing military occupation of more than a third of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus constitute a most blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly. The resulting plight of the Cypriot people is well known. I wish again to remind the Assembly that some 200,000 people had to flee their ancestral homes and have become refugee? in their own country, while to this day 1,619 missing persons are still unaccounted for. Furthermore, advantage has been taken of the continuing occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish military forces to bring in thousands of Turkish settlers in order to alter the demographic structure of the island. Ensuing acts of secession and partition were unequivocally condemned by resolutions of the Security Council, which has repeatedly called upon Turkey to withdraw its forces from the island. Mention should also be made of the looting of cultural treasures and the destruction of objects and monuments of historic value and places devoted to worship. To all this it should now be added that, according to recent disturbing indications, the Turkish-Cypriot side seems to be planning to install new Bulgarian Muslim settlers in the occupied part of the territory of the Republic.
Efforts to bring about a solution to the Cyprus problem entered a new, more hopeful phase after the new initiative taken in July 1988 by the Secretary-General in the framework of his mission of good offices. The President of the Republic of Cyprus has striven to conduct meaningful talks with the leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, with a view to reaching a solution that should be just and lasting, for the benefit of all citizens of Cyprus. We believe that President Vassiliou is right in addressing simultaneously the two aspects of the problem, namely, the withdrawal of all foreign military troops, eventually entailing the full demilitarisation of the territory of the Republic, and the reconciliation and coming-together of all Cypriots, regardless of ethnic origin. Greece supports the initiative of the Secretary-General and the efforts of the President of Cyprus.
However, we are deeply concerned by the new obstacles the other side has created. After some progress had been made in the course of three rounds of intensive talks, that side rejected the evolutionary process which the Secretary-General was pursuing with both parties to the dialogue in accordance with agreed procedures. In actual fact, the leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community suspended his participation in the talks in a manner which has put in jeopardy the Secretary-General's mission of good offices itself.
I repeat that Greece, for its part, shall continue to give its full support to the Secretary-General's mission of good offices. At the same time, we will not fail to denounce in unequivocal terms the lack of response from the other side to the endeavours towards a just and viable solution to the problem of Cyprus. Its international dimension and the aggravation resulting from the military occupation of part of the territory of a sovereign State, a Member of this Organization, constitute a permanent threat to peace and security.
I should be remiss if I did not pay a tribute to all the men and women who form the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations for their dedication in fulfilling a most noble task in the service of international peace. Greece has consistently supported United Nations peace-keeping activities. A Hellenic Air Force aircraft flew to Windhoek in Namibia on 7 June, carrying supplies for the use of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group as a contribution from the people and Government of Greece. Next month, Greek civil servants will join their colleagues from other countries to carry out their duties as electoral supervisors at the elections scheduled for early November in Namibia.
I should like to stress that we fully support and strive for the establishment of a financially secure and sound basis for all peace-keeping operations. Peace, and by extension peace-keeping operations, is the collective responsibility of all mankind. It follows that expenses for such operations, without exception, should be mandatory to all Members of the United Nations and assessed in accordance with the established scale of contributions. It has been stated before on behalf of the Greek Government that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus remains the only peace-keeping force to be financed by voluntary contributions, thus placing at risk the mission with which it is entrusted. I appeal to all Member States to support the Secretary-General's proposal to correct what appears to be an anomaly and an exception to the rule of financing peace-keeping forces through assessed contribution.
An overall review of world conditions would not be complete without a strong reminder that respect for human rights constitutes an active concern of the international community and is no longer an internal matter of each individual State. Our external policies are also influenced by the respect human rights are enjoying in other countries.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has been instrumental in promoting the legal and political concepts emanating from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Europe, and in particular among the 35 participating States to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, an important step was taken by the Concluding Document of the Vienna session, whereby a mechanism to monitor and control the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms was instituted. We shall actively participate in that process. At the same time, we do not fail to note with interest the prominence constantly given to a universal acceptance of the need for full respect of human rights and individual freedoms. The Declaration recently adopted by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at its summit conference at Belgrade gives ample proof of that positive development.
We are deeply concerned by the increased activities and costly implications of transnational drug trafficking. The trafficking of drugs is no longer an isolated national issue. It constitutes a global problem of grave social dimensions. Transnational and organized forms of crime have become so powerful that they challenge legal and democratic institutions in some countries. They are eroding the moral fibber of society. However, the fight against drug trafficking is receiving increased political support world-wide. For our part, we have declared a relentless war against drug dealers and their supporters. Further, Greece has joined other nations in signing, on 23 February 1989, the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances that was adopted last December. There is an urgent need for increased co-operation on a multilateral basis and the most appropriate forum for that purpose is provided by the United Nations. The question of international terrorism is also on the Assembly's agenda at the current session. The international community continues to be plagued by acts of the meanest and most cowardly form of violence. States members of the United Nations are uniting to co-ordinate their efforts in combating heinous crimes perpetrated at random or at will against innocent persons. Greece has not been spared from being the target of such crimes, but we have not been shaken in our determination and efforts to eradicate this scourge within the framework of international endeavours undertaken to that end.
Another problem I should like to single out is the destruction of the environment, which threatens the very existence of our planet today and degrades the quality of life. Greece, facing serious environmental problems, is in favour of dealing with this matter at both the international and the national levels. We attach great importance to the convening of a United Nations special conference in 1992 on environment and development. We believe that the conference must establish an international strategy and adopt ways and means with a view to obtaining sustainable and environmentally sound development in all countries. As far as my country is concerned, we shall spare no effort for its successful conclusion.
The 1980s represented a decade of contrast and diversity of developmental experiences. Progress has been accomplished in raising living standards and strengthening democratic institutions. However, large masses of people in some regions continue to live under unacceptable economic, social and political conditions. The debt crisis has become crushing in a large number of developing countries. It has blurred the distinction between social and economic issues, which are increasingly perceived in much the same way world-wide.
Greece contributed to the negotiation and adoption of decision 43/460 calling for a special session to be devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development of developing countries. It continues to play an active role in preparations for the session through the assumption of the chairmanship of the Preparatory Committee. The special session is seen as an opportunity to place development at the top of the world political agenda again, at a time when the relaxation of tensions in international relations has led to improved prospects for international economic co-operation.
Greece, a founding member of the United Nations, remains fully committed to the ideals enshrined in the Charter and to the multilateral approach. We therefore strongly feel that the United Nations should continue to intensify its efforts and exploit the best opportunities to resolve international problems through strengthened co-operation. The ultimate goal of achieving peace, security and prosperity remains as valid as ever. In this regard I share some of the optimism expressed in the report of the Secretary-General when he states that 'peace has gained a meaning and a dimension that it lacked before'. Peace, justice and human dignity appear to be assuming the dimensions of multilateral endeavours. This is the task of the United Nations, to which we are fully committed.
","We are indeed deeply satisfied that a most distinguished representative of Nigeria, a country with which Greece maintains traditionally the closest relations of friendship and co-operation, has been elected by acclamation to this prestigious office. The first level of action refers to the external aspect of a problem, which as a rule is relevant to the prevention or termination of an armed confrontation, the withdrawal of foreign military forces of occupation or foreign elements alien to a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated. The second level of action normally relates to the internal aspect of a regional problem, which, as previous examples clearly denote, consists of internal strife and the need for national reconciliation, the settlement of refugee problems, and the enforcement of human rights and the rule of law. We believe that President Vassiliou is right in addressing simultaneously the two aspects of the problem, namely, the withdrawal of all foreign military troops, eventually entailing the full demilitarisation of the territory of the Republic, and the reconciliation and coming-together of all Cypriots, regardless of ethnic origin. The special session is seen as an opportunity to place development at the top of the world political agenda again, at a time when the relaxation of tensions in international relations has led to improved prospects for international economic co-operation."
44,1989,KNA,"ï»¿
Mr. President, let me on behalf of the delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis congratulate you on your election to office. My delegation has absolute confidence in your abilities and those of the Vice Presidents, and we pledge our full support and co-operation.
I seize this opportunity to pay tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the diligence, commitment and perseverance he has displayed in working untiringly in the cause of peace. His efforts have been crowned with success. It is a success, however, which can be very fragile if it is not bolstered by the determination of the international community to support the cause of peace everywhere in the world.
Mr. President, I bring you warmest greetings from the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Right Honourable Dr. Kennedy Alphonse Simmonds, who had made all the arrangements to be here in this august body. You will appreciate that a tragic disaster has kept him at home. It was the seventeenth day of September, just two days before the sixth anniversary of the independence of our nation. All arrangements for the celebration were completed; many calls and expressions of congratulation were arriving from the family of nations. Suddenly we were struck by a horrendous hurricane called Hugo that left a path of death, destruction, tragedy and homelessness in the eastern Caribbean.
We in Saint Kitts and Nevis had proudly enjoyed a 5.8 per cent annual rate of growth in our economy over the past five years. We had developed our infrastructure to ensure a better way of life for every man, woman and child in our country, while adhering to the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Suddenly we found ourselves faced with the stark reality that the hands of the clock had been turned back and that it would be a number of years before we could repair the damage done by Hugo. A statement on hurricane Hugo has already been made to the General Committee by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of his Government and those of Dominica and Saint Kitts and Nevis, and I do not wish to burden this Assembly with our tale of woe. Suffice it to say that one cannot describe the tragedy that resulted after being buffeted continuously for over 10 hours by winds of some 140 miles per hour accompanied by some 10 inches of rainfall. Hundreds of persons are homeless and living in emergency shelters. Hospitals have been extensively damaged. Schools, churches, colleges, factories, police stations and ports have been destroyed. Electricity poles and wires were blown down, the water system damaged. Huge trees were uprooted and crops destroyed.
On behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, I must thank the various countries and agencies of the United Nations for the speedy assistance rendered. However, I wish to emphasize that to deal with the situation in the short term is not enough, and I call upon all members to help in the long-term rehabilitation of our infrastructure.
We have been fortunate in restoring the infrastructure for the tourism sector, so we can attempt to balance the loss in agriculture and light industry.
I turn now to the international scene, which seems to have some rays of light owing, in large part, to this Organization, so ably spearheaded by the Secretary-General.
In this context my delegation welcomes the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. We commend the role of the Secretary-General and the United Nations forces stationed there for working towards maintaining the cessation of hostilities and in continuously monitoring the situation there.
The task of the peace-keeping forces in that area and elsewhere is a vital but hazardous one which obviously requires extensive monetary resources for effective functioning. We call upon the economically strong end powerful States within the United Nations system to meet their obligations to the Organization -hat it may carry out its mandate for peace with greater efficiency.
In Afghanistan the conflict still smoulders. I appeal for an end to civil strife in that troubled country. I reiterate the need for the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan. There is a need for greater dialogue among the various internal factions, and for the creation of a political climate conducive to enabling Afghan refugees to return to their homeland. In the final analysis the peaceful resolution of the Afghan problem can best be achieved by the Afghan people.
In many of our countries, the will of the people is the foundation on which our societies are built. The will of my people in Saint Kitts and Nevis was freely and fairly exercised, without fear, on 21 March this year. I can do no other, therefore, that to speak out in defence of the will of peoples everywhere.
I wish to commend very highly the Secretary-General's initiative in relation to Western Sahara, resulting in the establishment of a technical commission to advance the peace process in that area. My delegation welcomes the convening of the July meeting in New York to investigate the possibility of accelerating end facilitating implementation of the united Nations and Organization of African unity settlement proposals, and the participation in the discussions of representatives of Morocco and the POLISARIO. I urge continued dialogue between the POLISARIO and the Kingdom of Morocco and a continued search for areas of agreement in the interest of the peace and stability of Western Sahara. There too the voice of the people should be heard. Our efforts to assist the people of Kampuchea to obtain peace and justice must continue unabated. Following the call of the General Assembly at its forty-third session for the creation of an interim administration in Cambodia, an international conference was held in Paris in July and August 1989, at which the nations of South-East Asia participated with others to develop a comprehensive peace plan to end two decades of fighting in Cambodia. We commend the Secretary-General for convening the conference. We must appeal to all parties to work within the United Nations framework to ensure that there is no return to the atrocities of the past.
I also request the Secretary-General to use his good offices to initiate a full investigation of the violence and abuses of power that occurred on the mainland of China in June of this year.
In the Middle East too the conflict continues unabated. There too the United Nations must seek to foster peace through dialogue. In spite of all the complexities of the conflict, one of the basic parameters for peace is that the right of the Palestinian people to a well-defined homeland mist coexist with the right of the people of Israel to live within secure borders. A first step to peace would be for all parties to adhere to the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the issue. My delegation also supports the proposal for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East.
In our region, encompassing Central America and the Caribbean, we have had both progressive and disquieting developments. In the Caribbean we have seen Governments either returned to office or changed at the will of the people in free aid fair elections. My delegation commends the Governments of Central America for the sustained and determined efforts they have made to restore peace and stability to the region. We recognize that the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) have contributed to the improvement in the level of harmony which is becoming more evident in the region. We applaud the collective constructive role those organizations are playing in the movement towards new elections in Nicaragua in 1990.
It is a source of great satisfaction to us that the Cartagena Protocol has been ratified, as it facilitates the membership in the OAS of Guyana and Belize, our partners in the Caribbean Community and Common Market, and undoubtedly has a positive impact on the encouragement of friendly relations between Belize and Guatemala. I must stress, however, that my country's support for the sovereignty of Belize remains undiminished.
Among the areas of disquiet already referred to in the region is Panama. In that country the will of the people was thwarted and frustrated by the untimely intervention of the military in the election process. This has led to an instability which can ultimately affect others in the region. My delegation condemns the blatant denial of the people's rights and calls for a speedy return to democracy there.
The people of Haiti too have suffered a similar fate, we call on the regime in Haiti to take all necessary steps to ensure that the people can freely elect a Government of their choice, so the Government so chosen can have a mandate and the authority to address the serious economic aid social ills of that country through its own efforts and also by the mobilization of international assistance. We cannot speak out in defence of the freedom and the human rights of people everywhere, then remain silent when people's rights are trampled and their freedom denied in South Africa. What is being called progress is nothing but a smoke-screen, a thin veneer which can be wiped away to reveal apartheid, still present in all its ugliness and inhumanity. There can be no moderate apartheid, no acceptable apartheid. We must not let our guard down; we must not be lulled into a false sense of complacency while the black majority are denied the right to vote, and denied the free exercise of a status equal to that of the white minority. No, the only solution is an end to apartheid and an acceptance that all men are created equal and that all are entitled to breathe the fresh air of freedom. Until that time we must be resolute in the application of sanctions against South Africa. That regime must never be in doubt about the intensity of our abhorrence of the evil system of apartheid.
In that context, I must warn that, according to our information, in spite of resolutions adopted at the forty-third session of the General Assembly, major obstacles to free and fair elections in Namibia still persist. There is still an atmosphere of fear and intimidation created by members of the South African Koevoet. There is still fear that secrecy will not be assured, and that some South African officials will be able to manipulate the elections. My delegation strongly supports Security Council resolution 640 (1989), adopted unanimously on Tuesday, 29 August 1989, calling for all parties, especially South Africa, to comply strictly with resolution 435 (1978), which details election procedures and provides for the disbanding of all paramilitary and ethnic forces and commando units. I call for an end to South African subversion of the Namibian independence process, and I must emphasize that it is the collective responsibility of the Governments members of the United Nations jointly to facilitate the establishment in Namibia of a stable government and economy. 
Sometimes our progress to Utopia appears slow, but we must not become weary. It is clear that, in spite of a multiplicity of problems, this Organization, the United Nations, has contributed and continues to contribute to the resolution of conflicts and the ushering in of conciliation and peace throughout the world. In recognition of this, I call for continuation of dialogue between South Korea and North Korea to achieve their mutual objectives. At the same time, I believe it would be timely and advantageous to welcome both of those countries which occupy the Korean peninsula into membership of the United Nations.
I shall now turn my attention to the issue of drug abuse. This is one of the most devastating threats facing the world today, a growing menace that transcends frontiers and cuts across political, economic and social boundaries, that cannot be controlled by any one country single-handedly.
At the recent meeting of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, agreement was reached as to the need for the creation of appropriate international mechanisms to assist in combating drug trafficking - namely, the Jamaican proposal for a multilateral force established under the United Nations to provide assistance in intelligence and interdiction; and the Trinidad and Tobago proposal for the establishment of commissions of inquiry and an international criminal court to investigate and adjudicate on the criminal responsibility of persons engaged in offences such as drug trafficking. We must continue to bear in mind, however, that, while recognizing the international implications of anti-drug operations, we must steadfastly respect the sovereignty of all States.
There are countries to which the issue of disarmament is more immediately relevant. I wish to emphasize, however, that progress in the area of disarmament creates the opportunity for substantial resources to be diverted to more humanitarian pursuits, including the protection of the environment. Whereas the protection and preservation of a healthy environment is important to all countries, it is crucial to the economic growth of developing island countries. We must depend upon the sea around us to provide abundant marine life to sustain us and our beaches and pure air to attract visitors from the crowded metropolis. The protection of the environment is the protection of life itself.
I come from a beautiful, peaceful country with no enemies, but subject to the vagaries of nature which can, in the twinkling of an eye, destroy our entire infrastructure and set us back decades. I am sure that I speak for all the people of my country, St. Kitts and Nevis, when I say that it is good to be a Member of this world body, which will listen to the voices of all its members, which will help in times of need, and which will continue to be the guiding light in times of tragedy, whether created by man or by a greater force.
","Suffice it to say that one cannot describe the tragedy that resulted after being buffeted continuously for over 10 hours by winds of some 140 miles per hour accompanied by some 10 inches of rainfall. The people of Haiti too have suffered a similar fate, we call on the regime in Haiti to take all necessary steps to ensure that the people can freely elect a Government of their choice, so the Government so chosen can have a mandate and the authority to address the serious economic aid social ills of that country through its own efforts and also by the mobilization of international assistance.

 We are meeting at a time when the dynamic of co-operation has gained ascendancy over that of confrontation. As a result a good mood prevails in the international environment. It has engendered perceptible improvement in international relations and anticipates the ushering in of an order of global peace and equitable development in which the United Nations would have a central role. That is why this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, convened as it is at such a hopeful juncture, is expected to promote the expansion of global co-operation in what should be a global endeavour to build a new and better world. Guyana is confident that under your able guidance, Mr. President, that expectation will be met. I therefore wish to extend to you my warmest congratulations and my best wishes for a successful presidency. In your personage as a distinguished son of Nigeria and of Africa reside all the qualities and virtues essential to such a high office.
I take this opportunity to pay tribute also to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the inspiring leadership that he so ably provided. As we review the evolution of international relations as we approach the end of the 198Å°S, it should be acknowledged that there have been positive developments in to search for an international order that yields equitable benefits to all members of the global society.	International tension has eased remarkably, dialogue and negotiation have given impetus to conflict resolution and bloc rivalries have noticeably diminished. Regional co-operation has become a global process, and changes of a far-reaching nature are being made within societies and in relations between-them. The retreat of colonialism is accelerating and in the expression of renewed faith in multilateralism there is Increasing recourse to the United Nations as a universal organization capable of being used effectively by its members in fulfilment of peoples aspirations which transcend national boundaries. In the economic field too changes are far-reaching and beneficial nature are taking place, though these are not yet as pervasive. These major trends and tendencies give us hope for the future. 
It is the case, however, that old problems to Which solutions have not so far been found persist and new issues have arisen posing new challenges. Solutions to these problems can be achieved only through openness and transparency requiring genuine international co-operation, for the issues are of Ð» global character. Here I refer to questions such as the environment and drugs.
In considering the myriad items on the international agenda, I suggest that we are helped by what is a more widespread appreciation of the current complexities and requirements which interdependence has generated. Today, interdependence is not merely a fashionable slogan its consequence has made global action an urgent imperative. Nowhere is this reality more patent than in the struggle for disarmament, especially in respect of nuclear weapons. Happily, this process has at last begun. By signing the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have demonstrated a commendable willingness to reduce their nuclear arsenals; and they are engaged in ongoing discussions on limiting strategic offensive weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
It is good to note as well that the question of conventional arms, beyond the level of sufficiency for national defence, is being increasingly addressed. This development should be encouraged at both the national and the international levels. I include the national dimension because it is unfortunately the case that conventional weapons have become a regular commodity of international trade.
Success can attend the international efforts in this area only if there is restraint in terms of both acquisition and production. Equally, our concern should be heightened by the dangers which rapid advances in the technology of weapons brigs. More generally, since the threat of the arms race affects the lives of all peoples, disarmament cannot be pursued on the basis of exclusivity. As the Secretary-General observed 
,... the United Nations should continue to be at the forefront of multilateral efforts in this field,. (A/44/1, p. 15)
The proper use of United Nations machinery in this regard is an indispensable requirement.
Detente between the super-Powers has had the beneficial effect of easing international tensions. This development has contributed to the emergence of an, environment in which the indigenous efforts of regional States to resolve their problems have been assisted. For it is that in all regions where conflicts exist the intrusion of external interests has complicated the search for a solution. It is the happy circumstance therefore that we can today witness in such conflict areas as Afghanistan, Central America, Iraq and Iran, and southern Africa that the conjuncture of super-Power detente and regional and other efforts have led to dialogue and negotiation for the solution to those conflicts and to fresh hopes for the settlement of disputes which at one time seemed intractable. In all these situations the United Nations has played an important and significant role. The process of settlement is, however, as yet incomplete.
The delicately negotiated peace agreements as regards Afghanistan should be scrupulously implemented so as not to jeopardize a political solution. In Central America, where the Esquipulas agreements and more lately the Tela agreement have paved the way to peace, the regional States roust be supported and their efforts brought to consummation. Iran and Iraq, which have agreed to a cease-fire, should both be urged towards reconciliation and the restoration of good relations. In Cyprus, it is regrettable that the intercommunal talks have not progressed as the international community would have wished. Vie urge all parties concerned to react favourably to the reasonable proposals advanced by the Secretary-General.
In Kampuchea, where war, destruction and suffering have prevailed for much too long, it is to be hoped that the States concerned will revive the Paris Conference in a determined attempt to find common ground. In Korea, where the North and South remain divided, the international community should provide greater stimulus towards their peaceful reunification, without outside interference.
In Western Sahara, where there are signs of progress in implementing the peace plan proposed by the Secretary -General and the Chair an of the Organization of African unity (OAU), we must urge the parties to co-operate folly in the endeavour to settle this protracted dispute.
Namibia, of course, has a unique relationship with the United Nations, which after all is the legal Administering Authority. Its freedom has for too long been denied by the intransigent Pretoria regime, few, however, Namibia appears to be on the threshold of regaining that freedom. The special responsibility the Organization bears imposes on it the need for it to be even more vigilant as the process nears its conclusion. We should brook no subterfuge or machination by South Africa to frustrate the exercise by the Namibian people of all their political rights and ensure that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is implemented in all its provisions. Guyana is numbered among those countries that have contributed human resources to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (IWTAG) operations that are intended to secure that result, we therefore look forward to welcoming an Independent Namibia to the Organization.
Namibia, the prospect for the end of apartheid - which is Inevitable - is not as clearly discernible in time. Nevertheless the shattering of the myth of the regime's military invincibility, taken in conjunction with the pressure exerted by the liberation movements and by the international community, and the contradictions inherent in the system of apartheid, render its sustainability increasingly difficult. Changes in keeping with the people's democratic aspirations must come. It is a matter of time. Meanwhile, it is necessary to intensify international pressure for such change. Sanctions must be maintained, tightened and expanded and succour and encouragement give to the oppressed people of that troubled land. There should be no relenting until apartheid is totally dismantled.
The Palestinians are yet another people deprived of their fundamental rights. Scattered throughout the world in a painful Diaspora they suffer the indignity of a people deprived of a homeland. The intifadah graphically portrays the consequences of the suppression of a people and at the same time their unshakable resolve to regain their freedom. The requirements for Q solution have long been prescribed. What has been absent is the determination of all members of the international community, and one or other of the parties concerned, boldly to take the necessary steps. The international conference on the Middle East called for by the United Nations could, if pursued with patience and with seriousness, lead to a durable and lasting negotiated settlement.
The current mood is not unpropitious to collective efforts aimed at solving the problems to which I have made reference. Let us seize the opportunity. Even as we do so, however, it is necessary to pay due attention to new issues that are global in scope.
The first of these is the environment. Even though the question of the human environment was first addressed in a global context at the world conference in Stockholm in 1972 it is only in recent times that the international community has been acutely sensitised to the dangers which its persistent degradation holds foe the future of mankind. It is apposite, I believe, to recall that in Stockholm the principles agreed for international co-operative action included respect for the sovereignty of States and the requirement that concern for the environment should enhance  not adversely affect, the prospects for growth of the economies of the developing countries. It was also agreed then that the international community should adopt appropriate measures to promote the legitimate interests of the developing countries in economic development. Present concern should respect those principles.
It is true that since 1972 further degradation of the environment has taken place, thus adding urgency to the need to adopt appropriate measures to halt and reverse this trend. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other international  id national bodies have devised helpful programmes in this respect. Yet there is a danger that unless the issue is addressed in a structured manner and without a zeal born of irrationality in e desired international co-operation could be made to succumb to prejudiced attitudes and unfair practices. In this regard, 1 speak as the representative of an Amazonian country, cognizant of the fact that some current positions on the utilization of the tropical rain forests, if maintained, could lead to unwanted delay in building a global consensus on the way forward.
Guyana is of the view that the present situation requires an approach which is based on true partnership and in which the sharing of burdens takes account of both differential capacities and past excesses. It has been stated, for example, that the tropical rain forests are a storehouse of bio-diversity which can be utilised for the benefit of all mankind. Yet it is a sad fact that those of us who own those forests end are being prevailed upon in one form or another to preserve them have rarely benefited from their exploitation as a game bank, except as consumers of other peoples' products. In tills regard it is imperative so to construct new arrangements as to enable the benefits of ownership to be at least equal to those of discovery. 1 accordingly call upon the United Nations and appropriate agencies to take action in order to make this a reality.
Happily as regards the second issue - that of drugs - there is increasing recognition that it can be dealt with adequately only if all dimensions of the problems are addressed with vigour. I refer to production# trafficking and consumption. It is good to note that within recent times action has been strengthened nationally and internationally. Guyana supports the initiatives taken by our sister Caribbean nations Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago deal with some facets of this terrifying problem. Ch this issue we can only move forward together.
,Aiming to international economic relations, it cannot be sand that the global economy is in good shape when assessed for its overall quality and against the backdrop of the well-being of mankind. It is true that world output continues to expand# and current evidence suggests that this trend will not be reversed. There are even claims that the world is on the threshold of a new era of prosperity. However, despite the many positive characteristics# the continuous amplification of the international economy has not always been vigorous. An m even pattern of growth has been experienced and this has not helped to revitalize the battered economies of some developing countries, although strenuous national adjustment efforts to achieve the relief promised by the expansion have been made.
After nearly a decade of the search for a satisfactory solution, debt continues to preside over the economic fortunes of many a developing country. Instead of being net recipients of financial flows capable of energizing their economies, the disadvantaged nations have become involuntary sources of finance for developed countries. Trade is always an imperative for growth. Yet the opportunities in that area have frequently been thwarted by the continuing resort to protectionism. The chance to produce positive results is greatly handicapped by the harsh conditions pertaining to commodities of export value to developing countries.
The world is highly competitive and efficiency and quality are paramount considerations. In such circumstances, increasing the possibilities for sustained growth demands that account be taken of the lagging technological capability of developing countries and the inadequacy of human resource development in the evolution of the world economy.
A significant feature of this decade is the extent to which the major industrialized countries have Increased their policy co-ordination on economic matters. Such action has brought success in the control of inflation, yet concern persists at all levels about the impact of large imbalances among industrialized countries and Instability of their exchange and interest rates on the future outlook for everyone.
It is against the background of such unsatisfactory conditions, in which hunger, malnutrition and preventable disease produce unacceptable numbers of casualties, that we assess the global economy. These economic and social problems must be overcome if developing countries are to cope with their current adversity and succeed in contributing to higher levels of sustained growth and development. Diminishing living standards and the widening gap between north and Southern counter to other efforts to increase peace and security and protect the environment.
The return to prosperity will not come about easily. Yet, as we survey the economic panorama, we observe a steady improvement in economic relations among States that gives rise to a new sense of possibilities in international co-operation. Such progress involves changes of both an international and a domestic character. They ate not only institutional but also issue-related. The progress is reflected in the intensification of integration processes in many regions of the world and the establishment of trade agreements. 
Over the last four years the countries of the Caribbean Community have sought vigorously to advance this process. Curing those years major decisions have been taken to develop the Community as a single economy. The latest measures are contained in the declaration, adopted by the Heads of Government of that Community when they met in July this year in Grenada. The Community, which is bound together by a perception of common destiny, has become more cohesive and its members more mutually supportive. The response of the States  d people of the Community to the devastation wrought open several island territories by hurricane Hugo is eloquent to money to the sense of fraternity that exists.
Their limitations notwithstanding, the recent proposals on debt have contributed to a gradual evolution of the debt strategy and create the hope that the problem could eventually be resolved. In this respect there is a need to move forward faster on debt reduction  id to extend its application as widely as necessary. At the same time, it is essential to ensure that the positive effects of debt reduction are not blunted by the unavailability of sources.  
The changes in these economic relation are evident in the shifts in the perception of, and the approach taken by the major multilateral institutions to, the problems of developing countries. M important development is the involvement of the International Monetary fund (IMF) in providing financial support for debt and debt-service reduction in line with more recent efforts to respond to this crisis. Additionally, with a growing number of low-income countries suffering economic setbacks, the 3MF has adapted its policies regarding the use by these countries of its structural adjustment facility. Moreover, it has created the enhanced structural adjustment facility, the terms of which have been adjusted to allow many beneficiary countries to draw on its resources in  we hope, a timely fashion.
 Multilateral trade negotiations are in progress under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (ATT), Gradual progress is being made  and until the discussions are completed the possibility remains open that a fairer and better trading system will be created. But such a possibility will be diminished if sincere efforts are not made to fulfil commitments on standstill and roll-back provisions that are vital to the growth of third-world trade. At the same time, more countries are making efforts to restore the international economy.  
Through all those measures, we can turn adversity into triumph for global development. It can be broadened by expanding the limits of co-operation to encompass suitable international policy action in all important areas of concern, including those of commodities and human resource development.
Our responsibility is clear. Together we must act to arrest the economic decline of developing countries. Interdependence and the quest for global harmony impose that responsibility on us. The special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in April next year  id the process of elaborating a new international development strategy are Important opportunities for pursuing those goals.
Our action should also reflect the urgency of the situation. The framework for action must always be that which offers the most efficient means of co-operation. Whether it be bilateral, multilateral or economic and technical co-operation among developing countries, Guyana stands ready to play its part in our joint endeavours.
It is most fitting that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of developing countries, will be taking place at a time when the prestige of the United Nations has been restored. The Organization has begun again to assert its prime responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security. In this respect the Security Council has met constantly to review developments and to exercise its authority as the guarantor of world peace.
Much of the credit for those developments is due to the Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, who has co-operated fully with Member States in the many initiatives taken to secure stability and progress in the international, political and economic system. His admirable annual report reflects the valuable work done this year to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations, and points with clarity to some steps which should be taken to achieve that result.
Over the years a sizeable corpus of Ideas has developed with an eye to improving the machinery of the United Nations. It is Guyana's hope that these ideas can be fully examined and implemented to the benefit of our Organization and its operations.
The tendency towards attitudinal changes bodes well for the future of the United Nations and should, if pursued, enable it to realize its full potential. Now Is the time to deepen this new-found faith in the United Nations so that it can proceed to expand the frontlets of achievement.
Clearly, new demands will be made on the Organization precisely as a result of the successes it has already scored. There will be, for example, a role entrusted to the United Nations to guarantee the scrupulous implementation of accords reached on the settlement of conflicts. If we are dilatory, the newly found prestige of the Organization will evaporate and leave the world once again prey to unwanted adventurism.
It is also important, as noted by the Secretary-General, that early preventive diplomacy should be more readily utilized, as it has distinct advantages over curative measures, which are often late, costly and less effective. At the beginning of this decade of peace and international law therefore, let us resolve fully to explore the advantage of resolving conflicts by political and legal means rather than by the threat or use of force. Let us also resolve to make more use of the International Court of Justice in the cause of peace.
At the apogee of success the United Nations is ideally poised to launch a major offensive against the legion of problems which continue to besiege the world. Their solution requires the conflation of the interests of all Member States# developed and developing alike.
Let us at this session raise the banner of unity and co-operation# and from now on work towards the installation of a regime of durable peace and prosperity.
","As we review the evolution of international relations as we approach the end of the 198Å°S, it should be acknowledged that there have been positive developments in to search for an international order that yields equitable benefits to all members of the global society. It is apposite, I believe, to recall that in Stockholm the principles agreed for international co-operative action included respect for the sovereignty of States and the requirement that concern for the environment should enhance  not adversely affect, the prospects for growth of the economies of the developing countries. In this regard, 1 speak as the representative of an Amazonian country, cognizant of the fact that some current positions on the utilization of the tropical rain forests, if maintained, could lead to unwanted delay in building a global consensus on the way forward. The special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in April next year  id the process of elaborating a new international development strategy are Important opportunities for pursuing those goals. It is most fitting that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of developing countries, will be taking place at a time when the prestige of the United Nations has been restored."

On behalf of the delegation of Liberia and on my own behalf, I congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your unanimous election to this high office is a tribute not only to Nigeria and Africa but also to your outstanding personal qualities as a statesman. The wealth of diplomatic experience and proven negotiating skills you bring to this assignment fully assure us of the successful conclusion of our deliberations and the efficient management of the affairs of the Assembly over the next 12 months.
Furthermore, given the very cordial and long-standing brotherly relations between our two countries, you can rest assured of my delegation's complete support and co-operation. We recall with satisfaction the very close working relationship which existed between the delegations of Nigeria and Liberia in 1969, 20 years ago, when my country, represented by Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph, had the distinction of occupying the high position of President of the General Assembly.
Let me also pay a wellâdeserved tribute to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the effective manner in which he conducted the work of the forty-third session. We wish him Godspeed in all his future endeavours.  Allow me, finally, to extend to our illustrious Secretary-General sincere thanks for the outstanding performance of the Secretariat since the last session of the General Assembly. His many initiatives in, and continuing personal commitment to, the search for world peace and understanding deserve the highest commendation and approbation of the Assembly.
The establishment of the United Nations 44 years ago marked the beginning of a new era in international relations. By adopting its Charter and instituting a working system of international co-operation, we resolved to eradicate the scourge of war, to strengthen peace through justice and international law, to respect the equal rights of all nations, large and small, to promote social progress and to protect human rights throughout the world.
In this regard the United Nations has become increasingly a centre for harmonising the efforts of nations in the attainment of the common aspirations of the international community.
The convening of these annual sessions has thus provided theÂ® opportunity not only to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism but also to explore new ways of transforming our hopes for solidarity into concrete action for peace and development.
It is against this background that, while taking note of the continuing improvement in super-Power relations that has further reduced global tension, my delegation must none the lees register its grave concern that since we last assembled hare most of the regional conflicts that appeared to be on the verge of resolution have continued to defy settlement.
For example, in Afghanistan, civil war rages on despite the Geneva Agreements; in Lebanon, a resurgence of sectional and factional strife continues to be fuelled by the presence of foreign forces; in Iran and Iraq, differences in interpretation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) have stalled the process towards a peaceful settlement; in the Middle East, the fighting goes on and tension remains high as various peace initiatives have been rejected; in Kampuchea the announced withdrawal of foreign forces has not materially changed this situations and so on.
In the meantime, most delegations at the forty-fourth session of the Genera! Assembly have highlighted, as they have done in the past, their respective Government's position on each of these and other regional conflicts. Pursuant to this tradition therefore, the Liberian delegation, in its turn, wishes to state its position, as follows;
In respect of the situation in the Middle East, my Government maintains that a just and lasting settlement must take into account the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, as well as the rights of all other States in the region, including Israel, to exist in secure and internationally recognized boundaries.
In the meantime, while the many enlightened peace initiatives that have been proposed, including the most recent by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, constitute very useful contributions to the search for a solution, my delegation wishes to reiterate our call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, with equal participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the authentic representative of the Palestinian people, We are convinced that such a conference would enhance the process leading to a durable peace in the region.
The factional strife in Lebanon, which has continued unabated, remains of grave concern to my Government, not least because of the very close relations which Liberia has enjoyed with that country over the years. We therefore support the call for withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the safeguarding of its independence. In this connection, we commend the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State, which It is to be hoped will contribute towards ending the sufferings of the Lebanese people.
Haiti respect to the problem of Kampuchea, we note that, while the recent Paris International Conference on Cambodia achieved progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements necessary for reaching a settlement, it was not possible to achieve a comprehensive political solution. My delegation therefore continues go support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country under international supervision, to enable the Kampuchean people exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through free and fair elections.
The renewed commitment of the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities would be a positive step in the right direction towards resolving the Cyprus question.
In this regard, the efforts of the Secretary-General, in compliance with the mandate of good offices entrusted to him by the Security Council, continue to be most useful and should be fully utilized by the two sides to obtain an overall settlement, taking into consideration the legitimate interests and concerns of both communities.
The Secretary-General in his report (A/44/1) points to further constructive developments towards ending the dispute in Western Sahara and the acceptance, with some remarks and contents, of the peace plan presented to the parties by himself and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. While accepting that some time will be required for the implementation of the plan, we urge both parties to muster the political will necessary for solution of this problem.
In connection with Korea, we encourage the resumption of dialogue between South Korea and North Korea with a view to easing tension. Furthermore, we believe that membership of the two Koreas in the United Nations should broaden the scope for their peaceful reunification.
With respect to Central America, significant developments have taken place which point towards prospects for peace in that region. The recent signing of the Tela Accord by five Central American Presidents is yet another manifestation of commitment to the undertakings assured under the Esquipulas II agreement by the Governments and peoples of Central America.
Having summarized Liberia's position on these regional conflicts, we are convinced that there is now a need for the international community to go beyond these annual restatements of positions and muster the necessary courage to accept the rule of law as the basis not only for the settlement of disputes, but indeed for the conduct of international relations as a whole.
In our view, quite apart from manâs selfish nature and his insatiable greed for power end wealth, the one factor that means to underlie most, if not all, regional conflicts, is man's failure to accept international law as an effective instrument for the achievement and maintenance of world peace and security.
That is why my delegation fully endorses the call of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries for a declaration of the 1990s as a decade on international law, to focus world-wide attention on the indispensable role of the rule of law in the search for peace. It is our hope that the Assembly will adopt this proposal and will formulate an appropriate programme of action for its implementation.
A related matter of great concern to Liberia is the question of respect for human rights, the promotion of which constitutes a fundamental objective of this organization. In this connection, we consider racist South Africa's policy of apartheid the most flagrant violation and abuse of human rights anywhere.
Despite the repeated appeals and protestations of the international community, the racist engine in Pretoria continues to perpetrate against the black majority the most horrendous atrocities, including all forms of torture and forcible removal of families and whole communities from their homes to live in so-called Bantustans under harsh conditions of deprivation and despair.
Furthermore, the state of emergency, deliberately designed to crush the resistance of the opponents of apartheid, has been extended foe yet another year to facilitate, inter alia, illegal detention, including of women and children. Bans and restrictions against anti-apartheid leaders, organizations and liberation movements remain in full force and effect.
The persistence of these conditions, which we have always described as resembling those obtaining in Nazi concentration an 3 torture camps, makes all the more urgent the need for the international community to take concerted action to end the abhorrent system of apartheid, considered by this Organisation as a crime against humanity.
My delegation continues to insist that the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions as laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter constitutes the last viable peaceful means of ending the explosive situation in South Africa.
It is ironic that these who ceaselessly advocate respect for human rights should be the very ones who continue to embolden the perpetrators of the system of apartheid by arguing that sanctions could only bring untold hardship and suffering to the black population and to the front-line States. But everyone knows that such arguments represent a mere pretext by these collaborators of the racist regime who may be interested more in securing profit on their investments than in protecting the human rights of the oppressed black people of South Africa.
Be that as it may, in our view the new minority Government in Pretoria does have a real chance to restore the human rights off the black majority and establish a non-racial democratic government. If its professed good intentions are to be taken seriously, however, the racist regime will have immediately to take the following minimum actions laid down by the international community: it must effect and unconditional release of all political prisoners and detainees, including Nelson Mandela; it must lift the ban and restrictions on all proscribed organizations and persons} and it must end the state of emergency and commence dialogue and negotiation with authentic non-white leaders.
At the forthcoming special session on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa, to be held in December this year, my delegation will seize the opportunity to address further this vexing issue. Meanwhile, we wish to reaffirm our support for the Harare Declaration off 21 August 1989, adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa off the Organization off African Unity, intended to eradicate apartheid and establish peace in the region.
The role of ay country in the independence struggle of Namibia began three decades ago. It can be recalled that, in association with the brotherly State of Ethiopia, the Government of Liberia in 1960 filed suite before the International Court of Justice contesting South Africa's right to administer Namibia and to impose upon that Territory its policy of apartheid. We have come a long way since then and are gratified by the progress which has been achieved thus far toward ending the illegal colonial domination of Namibia.
However, there can be no room for complacency in view of repeated manoeuvres by South Africa to circumvent full compliance with the provisions of resolution 435 (1978). We maintain that that resolution must be implemented in its original and definitive form to ensure that the people of Namibia participate freely, without intimidation, in the electoral process, under the supervision and control of the United Nations. In this connection, my delegation takes this opportunity to extend special thanks to the Secretary-General for his vigilance in the implementation of resolution 435 (1978), and urges him to continue his efforts, in pursuit of which we pledge our fullest co-operation and support.
Turning now to the issue of disarmament, Liberia maintains that, if peace and development are to be fully achieved, the world simply cannot continue to spend over one trillion dollars annually on armaments and related activities. The international community must therefore intensify its efforts towards disarmament, so that funds released in the process could be allocated to improving the world's socio-economic situation, particularly in developing countries.
In the meantime it my be recalled that my Government last year welcomed the ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Ranges Missiles - INF Treaty - by the super-Powers as a positive step in the disarmament process. Likewise, this year also we wish to welcome the recent progress achieved by the United States and the Soviet Union on conventional and strategic arms reduction. Notwithstanding these positive bilateral initiatives, however, we must reiterate that disarmament is a concern of the international community as a whole, and should be undertaken comprehensively within the framework of the United Nations with all countries participating on the basis of equality.
In this regard we recall with satisfaction the high-level Conference on chemical weapons held in Paris last January, which reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of chemical weapons and stressed the need to intensify multilateral negotiations on a convention not only to ban the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, but also to destroy all existing stocks. That Conference was a step in the right direction. However grave the global economic situation, of equal concern to my delegation is the growing incidence of environmental degradation. But before I address the problem of the environment and the economy let me first reflect briefly on a few social issues of critical importance to the international community, such as the problems of drug abuse, terrorism and hostage-taking, and the special problems of children, as addressed in the draft convention on the rights of the child.
With regard to the last of these the Liberian Government believes that the draft convention contains important safeguards for the protection of children, and we therefore call for its adoption during this session of the Assembly.
Liberia is also concerned about the growing wave of terrorism which puts innocent lives at risk and has the effect of impairing normal intercourse between nations and peoples. We deplore the abduction of individuals and hostage-taking as acts which deprive people of their fundamental human rights. In this respect my Government will continue to lend its co-operation to efforts by the United Nations and other international bodies aimed at completely abolishing terrorism and hostage-taking.
The Government of Liberia is similarly concerned about the alarming incidence of drug trafficking and drug abuse, which have already destroyed and continue to ruin countless lives and have undermined the integrity and stability of Governments. The monetary value of the illicit drug trade, which according to estimates far exceeds that of the international trade in oil and is second only to that off the arms trade, underscores the difficulty involved in the eradication of this pernicious global problem.
Consequently we must commend those Governments that have taken bold action to prevent and eradicate drug trafficking and drug abuse. But since, as we know, the illicit trade in drugs transcends national boundaries and involves for its success not only producers but, to an even greater extent, consumers, it is the collective responsibility of the international community to find an urgent solution to this menace before it is too late. Nowadays, environmental degradation occupies a very high position on the agenda of virtually every international conference, as well it should. For what is at stake here is nothing short of the continuing existence off life on this planet. Indeed, the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming as a result of the greenhouse effect, desertification and toxic waste rank among the most immediate of our concerns as regards their effect on the ecosystem.
Particularly, though, my delegation wishes to focus attention on the dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes on the territories of developing countries. In this connection we must register our disappointment that the Basel Convention, adopted in March 1989, does not address all the issues of interest to us on this subjectâ For instance, the Convention is inadequate in prohibiting transboundary movements of these wastes, contrary to the intent of the Organization of African Unity (OAIJ), which in a recent resolution has determined that dumping of hazardous wastes is a crime against Africa and its peoples. Accordingly, that resolution goes on to appeal to OAU member States not to enter into agreements that would permit the dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes within their borders.
As developing countries in general lack the technical capability to ensure effective control and disposal of hazardous wastes, it is necessary to effect a total ban on transboundary movements of these wastes. For its part, ray Government has enacted laws banning the dumping of toxic wastes on Liberian soil, prescribing penalties no less stringent than those in the 1989 Basel Convention. As a regional attempt to find solutions to this problem, a workshop held in Monrovia from 8 to 12 May 1989 recommended, inter alia, the establishment of a third-world bureau on environmental protection with certain clearly defined functions.
In a broader context, my delegation supports the proposal made by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Belgrade summit of non-aligned countries for the establishment of a planet protection fund. By the same token we welcome the proposal of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, presented in his statement to the assembly, for the establishment of an environmental protection council within the United Nations system. These proposals warrant the serious and timely consideration of the Assembly.
Finally, since the developed countries are the prima source of environmental degradation it is only fair and proper that they shoulder a greater share of the responsibility for global environmental protection, including the provision of adequate resources for that purpose. In this connection their development assistance to and investment programmes in third-world countries should now be designed to ensure sustainable development at no extra cost to these countries, and the developed countries should not begin to impose any form of environmental conditionalities on resource transfers to the developing countries.
To conclude on this point, permit me to recall that the question of the environment goes beyond toxic wastes. There are also issues of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and desertification - to name a few - which warrant the urgent attention of the international community. In this light the proposed international conference on environment and development, to be held in 1992, should go a long way towards addressing the issues.
While the world community has of late witnessed a thaw in super-Power relations, the resulting easing of tension and improvement in the political climate have shown no sign of relieving the desperate economic plight of developing countries. Living standards in third-world countries continue to decline as a result of the current hostile economic environment, which is characterised mainly by a crushing external-debt burden, a drastic fall in commodity prices, deteriorating terms of trade, and the increasingly protectionist stance of developed countries. We find it rather unacceptable that more than 1 billion people in our world today should be chronically undernourished, and that 13 million to 18 million of them die each year from hunger and starvation, 40 per cent being children. It is no less alarming that nearly as many people should be illiterate this far into the twentieth century.
As we know, such problems are not due to the lack of resources, but more to the persistence of an unjust international economic order which appears to thrive on exploitation and the inequitable distribution of the world's resources.
How else can the present phenomenon of developing countries being net transferers of resources to developed countries be explained? According to the 1989 annual report of the World Bank, the net resource transfer to the developed countries, which amounted to $10.2 billion in 1984, has readied a staggering $50 billion today, with a total debt stock estimated at $1.3 trillion.
Meanwhile, the developed countries of the industrialized North, both in the East and the West, appear to be concerned primarily with consolidating their already strong grip on the world economy. Not only have their economies registered consistent growth over the last decade; these countries have now embarked upon wide-ranging reforms aimed at their closer integration. Eastern Europe's new perestroika is providing the basis for tighter links to the free market economies of the West, and the Group of Seven could soon be due for expansion towards the East. At the same time, Canada and the United States have initiated a free trade agreement, while Western Europe moves steadily towards a single market in 1992.
What are the implications of all of this consolidation in the North? Do these and similar moves in the developed countries promise new opportunities of expanded markets for the primary commodities and the few industrial products of the developing countries? Or do they portend further protectionist tendencies against the developing countries of the South en an even grander scale?
These concerns on the part of my delegation arise not from any desire to be confrontational; far from it. In fact, Liberia has always espoused dialogue and co-operation over dispute and conflict. Our concern stems rather from the current stalemate in global negotiations, which renders prospects for any solution to the critical economic problems facing developing countries quite distant and uncertain. That is why my delegation fully supports the call of the Organisation of African Unity and the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement for a resolution of the North-South dialogue to address these problems.
None the less, while awaiting the resumption of that dialogue, we believe that the countries of the South will have to realize that, in the words of Nwaliau Julius Nyerere, Chairman of the South Commission:
'The only people responsible for the development of the South and the freedom of the South are the Governments and peoples of the South'. In this connection, my delegation considers that the time is now for the developing countries to make good their avowed commitment to South-South co-operation in a spirit of collective self-reliance, even in their dealings with the North.
It is in this light also that Liberia welcomes the decision of the States of our region to evolve an African alternative framework for structural adjustment, tailored to our own situation. No doubt this approach will be useful to other regions in making structural adjustment more relevant.
I cannot end this portion of my statement, however, without paying tribute to the United Nations for its tireless efforts in promoting a better standard of living for peoples throughout the world. We thus welcome the decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly in April 1990 to consider strategies for the reactivation of economic growth, particularly in developing countries. That session will no doubt prove useful in preparations being made for the ensuing fourth development decade of the United Nations. As we enter the last decade of the twentieth century, mankind is faced with challenges, old and new, requiring nothing less than the concerted action of the international community.
The continuing economic crisis in developing countries, the persisting threats to peace, the escalating incidence of drug abuse and other social ills, the rising tide of racists and human rights violation even in developed countries, and the increasing pollution of the environment - all such problems can best be resolved if they are addressed at all levels of international co-operation. In this context, whatever its shortcomings and imperfections, the United Nations remains the most appropriate forum and instrument for the harmonization of national efforts towards the attainment of durable peace and sustainable development in our world.
We therefore reaffirm our full commitment to the strengthening of this organization, thereby to contribute to making it all the more effective in the pursuit oÂ£ its aims and objectives in the years ahead.
","By adopting its Charter and instituting a working system of international co-operation, we resolved to eradicate the scourge of war, to strengthen peace through justice and international law, to respect the equal rights of all nations, large and small, to promote social progress and to protect human rights throughout the world. For example, in Afghanistan, civil war rages on despite the Geneva Agreements; in Lebanon, a resurgence of sectional and factional strife continues to be fuelled by the presence of foreign forces; in Iran and Iraq, differences in interpretation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) have stalled the process towards a peaceful settlement; in the Middle East, the fighting goes on and tension remains high as various peace initiatives have been rejected; in Kampuchea the announced withdrawal of foreign forces has not materially changed this situations and so on. In the meantime, while the many enlightened peace initiatives that have been proposed, including the most recent by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, constitute very useful contributions to the search for a solution, my delegation wishes to reiterate our call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, with equal participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the authentic representative of the Palestinian people, We are convinced that such a conference would enhance the process leading to a durable peace in the region. If its professed good intentions are to be taken seriously, however, the racist regime will have immediately to take the following minimum actions laid down by the international community: it must effect and unconditional release of all political prisoners and detainees, including Nelson Mandela; it must lift the ban and restrictions on all proscribed organizations and persons} and it must end the state of emergency and commence dialogue and negotiation with authentic non-white leaders. The continuing economic crisis in developing countries, the persisting threats to peace, the escalating incidence of drug abuse and other social ills, the rising tide of racists and human rights violation even in developed countries, and the increasing pollution of the environment - all such problems can best be resolved if they are addressed at all levels of international co-operation."

Mr. President, I bring you the fraternal greetings of my people and our congratulations on your elevation to your high office. Your country, Nigeria, and mine have deep historical and cultural links which underscore the need for mutual support and co-operation. However, on account of your personal qualities and the vision which you bring to the presidency, you are assured of the unfailing support of my delegation.
Permit me here to express my thanks to the former President, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the skilful manner in which he has directed our deliberations over the past year. His guidance was most encouraging and the results, I must add, most gratifying.
I wish to offer my country's sincerest thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and to the organs of the United Nations for the support extended to Antigua and Barbuda in the wake of one of the most devastating hurricanes ever to have unleashed its fury upon the eastern Caribbean. The damage to my country was severe but the response of the international community reaffirms my faith and my people's faith in the effectiveness of the United Nations organs and in the goodwill of mankind.
Fifty years ago the havoc, brutality and destructiveness of the Second World war was visited on mankind. The United Nations, be it remembered, was created at the end of the conflagration to promote peace, security, economic reconstruction and self-determination. Today the role of the United Nations is pivotal in the continued promotion of peace, in the stride towards economic development and in the reconstruction efforts of so many nations where the ability to function has beat impaired by disasters, man-made and natural.
This year, as the people of Antigua and Barbuda struggle to overcome the devastation of a hurricane, the r a is on d'etre of the United Nations is made manifest. The Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator and the United Nations Development Programme deserve high commendation for the support and pledges of continued assistance extended to my nation immediately following upon the consequential dangers of this natural disaster.
Two very disquieting and unrelenting man-made dangers which alarm my country and menace the most powerful countries in this hemisphere are terrorism and the trafficking in narcotics. Both are grave causes of concern to the decision makers in my twin-is land country.
It was less than one year ago that Mercenaries unsuccessfully attempted to invade the Republic of Maldives. That blatant act of terrorism is a threat to the sovereignty of all snail countries in every hemisphere and an unsuspecting drain on our limited resources. My country can ill afford to spend our scarce foreign currency earnings on acquisition of military hardware. The choice for us is whether to buy more tractors, or to bring telephones into a distant village, or to offer scholarships to deserving youth, or to repair secondary roads for our farmers to transport their goods to market, or to increase our promotional budget for attracting business and visitors to our shores. But this looming terrorist threat requires a diversion of those scarce resources to rifles and ammunition and military uniforms. It is a threat which causes us to look towards the United Nations for support. My country will join forces with a score of small countries to sponsor a draft resolution proposed by the Republic of Maldives requiring the creation of a type of United Nations peace-keeping force to come to the assistance of any small State when requested so to do by its legitimate authority in the face of a terrorist threat to its sovereignty.
In my immediate region, the eastern Caribbean, eight nations, including my own, have formed a regional security force which offers greater protection than any single member State can provide on its own. But Antigua and Barbuda none the less endorses a broader approach as proposed by Jamaica in a pending united Nations draft resolution. The creation of a multilateral unit established under the aegis of the United Nations is most appealing. Such a unit would possess the ability to provide assistance in situations requiring intelligence and interdiction capabilities; both are currently beyond the wherewithal of the extant Caribbean regional security system. The mere willingness of many small countries and many
island developing countries to lend their support to the concept evidences our increased faith in the United nations
Over the past two weeks every Head of State from the Americas who has addressed this body has expounded on the scourge of drug trafficking. The Presidents of the United States and of Colombia have noted that the threat to democracy posed by the drug cartels is real and present. The threat to my nation's sovereignty is not imagined. Wealthy and powerful drug barons, when driven from their castles in one nation, will look to less defensive States from which to continue their criminal activity. To forestall the prospect of elevation fro*5 transit points in the trafficking of drugs to distillation centres for the production of the substance our island countries intend to seek increased United Nations protection. For an industry which ranks second in economic activity only to the arms trade and whose profits exceed the global cost of debt-servicing, we are fighting a disaster more horrendous in its implications than an entire summer of hurricanes,
drug abuse eats away the very foundations of civilizations and cultures which generations passed have bequeathed to us. It turns its victims into unrecognisable creatures and destroys our youngsters as surely as no tempest can. The purveyors of this evil must be apprehended and punished. Small countries such as my own are conscious of the superior strength which the drug barons possess. Antigua and Barbuda will therefore be a co-sponsor of the draft resolution to be tabled by Trinidad and Tobago proposing the creation of an international criminal court of justice empowered with jurisdiction to bring to trial and to convict those dealers in death who have no nationality and for whom the sanctity of life has no meaning.
The traffic in drugs and the threat of terrorism have the potential to undermine our sovereignty. But the harm to the environment, resulting in global warming, threatens the coastline of every country with flooding and our low-lying island nations with complete submersion.
In March of this year we witnessed the convening of a summit meeting on the protection of the global atmosphere. The leaders of 24 countries adopted a common declaration addressed to all nations. The Hague Declaration emphasized that the environmental problem is world-wide and requires solutions devised on a global scale. The nature of the dangers involved necessitates the seeking of remedies to preserve the ecosystem and to enable humanity to live in dignity in a viable global environment. All States have an obligation both to our populations and to future generations. There is therefore need for regulatory, supportive and adjustment measures to take into account the participation and potential contribution of States which are at varying levels of development.
Many developing countries contribute to the degradation as their burgeoning populations cut down forests to provide timber and to make land available for cattle ranching and agriculture, much as the developed countries have done for centuries. The grave nature of the resulting, looming crisis can be gleaned from computer projections which indicate that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a consequence of development could increase the earth's average temperature by 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit before the year 2050. Resulting weather patterns could make infertile large tracts of land now under food production, and oceans could rise by several feet to flood large areas of coastal land, thereby causing innocent, non-contributing island countries to disappear under the sea.
There is undoubtedly an increased recognition in all countries of the gravity of the environmental problem and collectively there are specific measures which can be taken by the nations of the world to safeguard our planet. There should be the imposition of special taxes on carbon-dioxide emissions, which would serve to encourage conservation. Environmental review should become am integral part of lending procedures within countries so that local banks could be prevented from providing funds for projects that destroy habitats. Funding should be increased for research on alternative energy sources, including that of solar power, and safer designs for nuclear reactors. Financial assistance should be given to developing countries to enable us to construct high-efficiency power plants. And, although a number of other costly measures could be implemented, the simple act of establishing an international tree-planting programme is highly recommended.
My country appreciates that the problem is most complex. Antigua and Barbuda accepts the view enunciated by the Commonwealth Secretary-General that 'the current work on greenhouse gases and global warming requires the combined skills of physicists, meteorologists, biologists, geographers, economists, lawyers, engineers ... To deal with such problems satisfactorily is a challenge to both statesmen and thinkers.'
It is widely accented that all solutions require multilateral co-operation, we insist that the principle of multilateralism be applied, conscious of the fact that the mechanism of the United Nations mu3t again be called upon to provide technical leadership and support.
Antigua and Barbuda also seeks the support of the United Nations community in promoting a new approach to measuring the economic well-being of island developing countries. We again reiterate that the use of conventional economic indicators to measure the economic standing of island developing countries is neither apt nor realistic.
Conventional indicators distort our economic soundness, ignore the fragility of our economic base, and fail to compensate for the disproportionately high costs attached to providing routine services to small populations. The gross national product per capita is the major culprit. It does not take into account that tourism, the economic lifeline of many developing countries including my own, requires massive expenditures for promotion. The export of manufactured goods does not. Promotional spending takes place in the developed countries from which the tourists come, resulting in a continuous transfer of our hard-earned hard currency to developed countries. But this spending must take place. Promotion is the sine qua non of a successful tourist-based economy) 60 per cent of the gross domestic product off my country is generated by tourism. The gross national product per capita measuring device does not take that major fact into account; nor does it give an adequate representation off our country's governability. Last month a single hurricane destroyed in 12 hours the 50 years' work it took my Government to provide a functioning electricity delivery system. The damage to our homes, our schools, our single hospital, agricultural crops and, most particularly, our fishing industry exceeds in dollars the aggregate export earnings off five years.
combined. The difficulties resulting from hurricane Hugo are compounded by economic constraints posed by our smallness, by an increasing disappearance of preferential markets, by a decline in official development assistance and by access restrictions to soft-loan financing. Island developing countries once again present our case for the use of more reliable economic indicators and for special assistance from the United Nations and its many organs.
Over the past six sessions Antigua and Barbuda has been in the forefront on the question of Antarctica. Again we seek to remind this body that Antarctica is mankind's last frontier. Man's intrusion there, if not carefully monitored and regulated, can dramatically alter the global ocean currents and weather patterns. Antarctica is a meet significant regulator of the earth's weather systems; any change in the Antarctic environment can have a dire impact on the climate and environment of other parts of the earth.
Last year we had much cause for regret when we learned of the decision of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to disregard totally and completely General Assembly resolution 42/45, of 30 November 1987, which called for a moratorium on negotiations to establish a minerals regime until all members of the international community are able to participate fully in such negotiations. This year we are greeted with a glimmer of hope as three of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have declared that they will not sign the minerals convention and are advocating instead the establishment off an Antarctic wilderness park. We welcome this development. Antigua and Barbuda continues to call for the direct involvement of the United Nations and the fullest co-operation of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties with the Secretary-General or his representative.
Many recent developments in technology have brought about major changes in the domestic well-being of several developing countries. As the pace of technology quickens, assail developing countries seeking to keep pace experience a strain on their resources. My country is nevertheless determined to use the products of science and technology to realize its development goals. Our long-standing efforts to build and strengthen our endogenous capacity in science and technology have taken on a sense of urgency as we seek to improve social and economic conditions through expanded production, increased export earnings and international competitiveness. If we are to enhance the infrastructure of our learning institutions in the fields of science and technology, if we are to improve the management of science and technology, then my country must press the international community to increase the flow of technology to small countries on conditions acceptable to us.
The islands of the Caribbean were once populated by an ancient, robust, sea-faring people: because of man's greed and viciousness, their populations were decimated to the point of near extinction. Relics of their civilization can be found throughout every Caribbean island. Antigua and Barbuda is thus compelled to raise its voice in calling for the protection of indigenous peoples in the modern world.
We make this appeal in the knowledge that in this century ft ere have been more ethnocides, genocides and extinctions of distinct ethnic and tribal groups than in any other period of history. In 1988 more than 200,000 indigenous people around the world were murdered and more than 2 million were forced to flee their homelands.
The violence manifested against indigenous peoples is in no sense random. The violence occurs, most frequently, when States or dominant groups attempt to exert complete control over ethnic or tribal minorities. Many indigenous people live in the more remote and least-explored areas of their countries. They have been pushed so far that they are making a final stand against aggression. But they fight, like the heroic Caribbean peoples of centuries past, against more formidable foes, to which they will most certainly succumb. Not many decades from now the fate of the world's remaining indigenous peoples could be decided once and for all. Antigua and Barbuda will readily give its support to the proposal by the Group for the Studies of Indigenous Populations - a part of the United Nations Sub-Committee for the Protection of Minorities - that 1992 be declared the international year of the indigenous peoples of the world.
Africa's struggle for total liberation will come only with the eradication of apartheid. We are convinced that the oppressed majority of South Africa - the black people of South Africa - will soon win its freedom, with the unfailing support of the United Nations. This year the General Assembly will again devote a special session to apartheid. But we are certain that the racist Pretoria regime will completely ignore the resolutions which are likely to emerge since it has, with impunity, ignored those which were adopted last year. South Africa must be compelled to lift all state-of-emergency regulations, end its ban on all political organisations, restore free speech and movement, and commence a dialogue with the representatives of the majority population. My country reiterates its call for the adoption of mandatory sanctions of a comprehensive nature against the racist regime as a means to compel it to comply. Antigua and Barbuda calls once again for the release of Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners and seeks the cessation of the harassment of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Reverend Alan Boesak.
Antigua and Barbuda condemns the racist South Africans for creating impediments to an independent Namibia. The States Members of the United Nations cannot become complacent; we must not allow South Africa to jettison the agreements readied through our efforts here. If we fail to deter South Africa we shall disappoint the world, which is watching us, eager to see Namibia take its rightful seat as the one hundred sixtieth State Member of the United Nations. The men and women of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), international civil servants who are on site in Namibia, have placed their lives in jeopardy; several nationals of my small country are serving in Namibia under UNTAG. The Assembly must ensure that they do not labour in vain, that South Africa complies with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We cannot allow the effort to end in failure.
Continuing on the subject of the African continent, we turn now to Western Sahara. Antigua and Barbuda actively supports the peace plan of the United Nations Secretary-Genera' and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. We lend our support to the people of Western Sahara in their struggle for self-determination and endorse all international efforts aimed at securing peace and stability in the Maghreb region.
Permit me to focus upon my own region briefly. Antigua and Barbuda applauds the developments in Central America, which are certain to bring peace. We endorse Security Council resolution 637 (1989), which relates to the Esquipulas II agreements. We adhere to our earlier statements that economic injustice is tine
root cause of many of the Local conflicts there; these conflicts were exacerbated by the cold war. The number of proxy wars, though, is fast diminishing, and we welcome the demobilization and repatriation of irregular forces. poor nations with bare material storehouses can ill afford the squandering of scarce resources brought on by wars. The strengthening of democracy in the region will continue if peace lasts; economic reform must also be instituted in order to guarantee peace. The people of Central America, and especially the people of Panama, are assured that our hearts are with them in this era of extreme difficulty; it is our sincere hope that their many crises will soon be resolved.
Further a field, we are discouraged by developments in Afghanistan. Despite the Agreement on the Settlement of the Situation relating to Afghanistan, and despite the unanimous adoption of resolution 43/20 of 3 November 1988, the suffering of the sturdy Afghan people continues. My country reiterates its support to that people's struggle to achieve self-determination and total autonomy.
In Lebanon, the people must be allowed to settle their differences without undue interference. My country stands ready to endorse any proposal that will lead to full Lebanese sovereignty over the entire country and guarantee the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese soil.
The entire Middle East conflict continues to have the propensity for generating repercussions in a far wider sphere. The decisions taken by the Palestine National Council at Algiers in November 1988 and at Geneva the following month created a diplomatic momentum which has since been supplanted by mistrust and doubt. It is imperative that there be an international peace conference. The interests of all concerned are best served through dialogue and negotiations in an atmosphere propitious to peaceful resolution. The United Nations must continue its
quest to find a letting settlement, premised on the rights of all States and peoples in that region to exist within recognized and secure borders.
In South-East Asia, two Koreas seem permanent. The Republic of Korea has repeatedly expressed its desire to become a Member of the United Nations. Antigua and Barbuda can find no logical cause or explanation for denying it membership; further, we consider it unjust that it is barred from membership for reasons other than those stipulated in the United Nations Charter.
Last year at this time we were encouraged by developments relating to Cambodia. Unfortunately, the Conference convened in Paris at the initiative of the Government of France fell short of getting a direct commitment from the various factions. But it succeeded in working out significant elements of a comprehensive settlement and in identifying necessary aspects of a solution. It is hoped that there will be no slackening of efforts to bring about peace and justice in Kampuchea.
In Cyprus, the fact that the leaders of the two sides involved in that conflict have committed themselves to achieving an overall settlement augurs well for the future. We are heartened by our Secretary-General's announcement that a critical juncture has now been reached. Antigua and Barbuda consequently gives its full support to the effort and urges the two parties to reach an acceptable solution within the year.
Like snail countries Antigua and Barbuda looks increasingly to international law for protection, and we are keenly aware of the role of the United Nations in promoting respect for law. The lawless dumping of hazardous wastes in developing countries requires immediate United Nations action. It is unfair and unthinkable to burden with the by-products of affluent societies those that are endeavouring to keep their fragile ecosystems safe for this and future generations. It would be suicidal to accept the wastes of industrial societies in the Caribbean given the complete reliance of our peoples on every square mile of our land and sea. Antigua and Barbuda calls for a strict international regime to protect all developing countries from becoming dumping-grounds for hazardous wastes.
My delegation's request for United Nations assistance and support in our hurricane recovery efforts, in the establishment of a multilateral force, in the creation of an international court of criminal justice in the provision of leadership and support on environmental issues, and a few other natters catalogued earlier, might appear to suggest that my small island developing country and maybe other small countries are willing to surrender, or to trade in, elements of our sovereignty for greater security and improved conditions. My country guards its sovereignty jealously. Antigua and Barbuda will remain a free and fully independent country just as long as the nation-State system survives. My Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Doctor Vere Cornwall Bird, has for 50 years been in the forefront of the struggle to win our independence, to improve our standard of living and to foster in us pride in our heritage. He continues to pass on to us a legacy which we shall never abandon. Antigua and Barbuda will do all in its power to ensure our continued development, to ensure lasting peace, and to secure humanity's survival through, multilatra1 efforts. However, we are willing to part with no more of our sovereignty than is the most powerful country in any hemisphere.
","Today the role of the United Nations is pivotal in the continued promotion of peace, in the stride towards economic development and in the reconstruction efforts of so many nations where the ability to function has beat impaired by disasters, man-made and natural. The choice for us is whether to buy more tractors, or to bring telephones into a distant village, or to offer scholarships to deserving youth, or to repair secondary roads for our farmers to transport their goods to market, or to increase our promotional budget for attracting business and visitors to our shores. My country will join forces with a score of small countries to sponsor a draft resolution proposed by the Republic of Maldives requiring the creation of a type of United Nations peace-keeping force to come to the assistance of any small State when requested so to do by its legitimate authority in the face of a terrorist threat to its sovereignty. For an industry which ranks second in economic activity only to the arms trade and whose profits exceed the global cost of debt-servicing, we are fighting a disaster more horrendous in its implications than an entire summer of hurricanes,
drug abuse eats away the very foundations of civilizations and cultures which generations passed have bequeathed to us. My delegation's request for United Nations assistance and support in our hurricane recovery efforts, in the establishment of a multilateral force, in the creation of an international court of criminal justice in the provision of leadership and support on environmental issues, and a few other natters catalogued earlier, might appear to suggest that my small island developing country and maybe other small countries are willing to surrender, or to trade in, elements of our sovereignty for greater security and improved conditions."
44,1989,MOZ,"ï»¿It is with profound satisfaction that I congratulate the President on his unanimous election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are proud when a sot of Africa is elected to a position of such responsibility. His long diplomatic experience and the dedication and competence with which he guided the work of the Special Committee against Apartheid guarantee that our work will be crowned with success. We wish him every success in discharging the high responsibility with which he has been unanimously entrusted. We express again our readiness to offer him all our support and co-operation for the success of the Assembly's deliberations.
We commend the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the lucid aid efficient manner with which he presided over the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
He seize this occasion to express our special appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his contribution in the search for solutions to regional conflicts, and the other problems that affect international peace and security. He commend his personal commitment in securing support for the emergency programme in Mozambique. We renew our hopes that these efforts will continue as long as the critical situation in my country prevails.
The current session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity to make an assessment of the avenues we have explored thU3 far in the search for ways aid means more conducive to a future of peace and stability in our world. The Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization (A/44/1), and several preceding speakers have described the present trend in international relations as positive and promising. He subscribe to this assessment. Indeed, the current international atmosphere appears to be less gloomy than a few years back, less tense and less volatile.
It is evident that constructive steps have been taken since the last session of the General Assembly.
The dialogue and rapprochement between the two major Powers are a contributing factor to the present trend in the international situation. That trend is also a result of the struggle of the peace-loving peoples of the whole world, who have always pleaded for disarmament, peace and international security. We hope this trend may continue, be strengthened and play a catalytic role in efforts towards the elimination of hotbeds of tension in the world. In my country, this new dynamic in international relations has been received with optimism and expectation inasmuch as it corresponds to the noblest aspirations of the Mozambican people to achieve peace and freedom in our region aid in the world. However, this trend does not appear to have touched the consciousness of those bent on the destruction and destabilization of our country ad on frustrating our project of building a developed, just and democratic society in Mozambique.
In the period since the last session, massacres, destruction ad looting have continued unabated in Mozambique. The armed terrorists have continued to destroy hospitals, trains ad railways? they have carried out acts of sabotage on power lines and on economic and social infrastructures.
In the same period, more evidence has been gathered again proving that we ate confronted with an operation of destabilization that should not be confused with a struggle between two parties. In fact only a operation of destabilization of this nature can explain the scale of devastation, destruction and terror that has resulted in 700,000 dead, 1.7 million displaced Mozambicans, ad 5.6 million citizens living in a state of emergency.
Our people are aware that independence and freedom demand sacrifices, including the sacrifice of our own lives. Thus our people have not vacillated in the face of this holocaust, and, guided by their party, FREL1MO, the Mozambican people have harnessed all their resources ad organized themselves to defend the father lad from aggression. Under bullet fire, in the midst of pain and mourning, our people have never stopped producing, under a tree, in the midst of the ruins of what had been a school just the day before, our children carry on with their studies. They learn to love their country, to sow the seeds of a better future.
In 1987 the Mozambican Government launched a vast economic recovery programme in our country. This programme is an option aimed at arresting the galloping economic deterioration that has been experienced aid at initiating a progressive recovery of production in various sectors of the economic and social life of the country.
The programme is aimed also at the introduction of corrective measures in the economic and financial sectors, and thus at creating conditions for a gradual change of the economic structure upon which our economy is based.
Within the framework of this programme modest results have been achieved. For example, an increase in gross domestic product of 3.6 per cent was registered in 1987, and 4.6 per cent in 1988. This is rather encouraging. This growth is due primarily to progress in the fields of agriculture, industry and commerce.
In the political field, the Mozambican people, from Rovuma to Maputo, participated in the Fifth Congress of the ERELMO party. This was an excellent occasion to reflect on the past, present and future of the country. Important problems were tackled, related to war and peace, national unity, socio-economic, technical and scientific development, showing once again that all Mozambicans identify themselves with FRELIMO and its goals, and that the FRELIMO party is the party of all Mozambicans. The Congress constituted a high moment in the exercise of democracy.
The Fifth Congress of the FRELIMO party took far-reaching decisions for the life of the Mozambican nation. The Congress redefined the strategy aid tactics of the economic and social policies of the country, in response to the present national, regional and international environment. The Congress recommended the adoption of measures to encourage collective and individual participation in production, in particular food production.
Changes to the statutes, programme and directives of the FRELIMO party responded to the popular will as expressed in the wide national debate that preceded the Party Congress, which called for the strengthening of the social base of the party as a unifying factor for the nation.
The FRELIMO party and the Mozambican Government announced a set of principles to end the war by peaceful means. They may be summarized basically as follows.
First, the war in Mozambique is not the result of a struggle between two parties. The armed bandits do not constitute a political party, but are, rather, an instrument of an operation of destabilization carried out against our country.
Secondly, policies to guide the country in the political, economic, social and cultural fields are established by national consensus reached through a process of consultation and debate with the people.
Thirdly, individual and social liberties such as freedom of worship, freedom of expression aid freedom of assembly are guaranteed. However they must not be used to destroy national unity, national independence or the integrity of persons aid property. They cannot be used for the preparation or perpetration of violent actions against the State and the Constitution.
Fourthly, policy or constitutional changes or revisions, or revisions to the main legislation of the country can and should be made only with the broad participation of all citizens.
Fifthly, it is unacceptable for a group to use intimidation or violence to impose themselves on society at large. It is anti-democratic to alter the Constitution and the main legislation of the country as a result of the violence of a group.
Acceptance of these principles by the ringleaders of the armed bandits is the prerequisite for the beginning of an eventual dialogue between the Government and the leaders of the armed bandits with a view to identifying the modalities and medial is to end violence and to normalize the life of all Mozambicans, including those now involved in armed banditry.
Such a dialogue, we must emphasize, cannot and shall not be aimed at creating situations or conditions that might undermine national unity or lead to power-sharing. Any change in the Constitution or in the fundamental legislation of the country can be acceptable only on the basis of the established order, democracy and national consensus and not on the basis of violence by one group against the people, organized society and the State. Since the proclamation of our national independence the adoption of our main legislation has taken place only after consultations and discussions have been carried out among the people. It is in this context that we are now undertaking the revision of the Constitution and the electoral law. This reflects the growth of our democracy and the consolidation of our State.
On the basis of the above-mentioned principles, President Chissano, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique, has asked Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya to help us to create the necessary conditions for an eventual dialogue between the Government and the ringleaders of the armed bandits.
The latter were informed of our 12-point peace initiative by the leaders of certain Mozambican religious denominations that initiated contacts with the ringleaders of the armed bandits with a view to persuading them to stop the massacres and destruction and to reconcile themselves with their fatherland and the people. Two meetings have already been held in Nairobi between the religious leaders of certain denominations and the ringleaders of the armed bandits. This process is still unfolding, and it is too early for us to draw any conclusion. However, as long as the state of war prevails the country will continue to suffer from its devastating effects, the losses being colossal in terms of both human suffering and the destruction of the economic aid social life of our people.
The state of emergency is still a reality in our country. It is therefore very encouraging that the international community continues to recognize the urgent need to provide assistance to the affected population in the form of food, clothing and production tools that enable the people to resume their normal lives. In this regard I wish once again to express our gratitude to the entire international community for its invaluable assistance and solidarity.  As this session of the General Assembly is being held, there is hope that we are witnessing the birth of an independent Namibia. As Members of the United Nations, one of the major protagonists in this process, we have the unique responsibility to harness all efforts to ensure that the Namibian people's right to self-determination is exercised with order and harmony, in an atmosphere of justice and democracy. We reaffirm our complete confidence in the Secretary-General? we are certain he will know what measures to take to ensure close monitoring and supervision of the process with a view to detecting, denouncing and neutralizing any and all manoeuvres that may compromise Namibia's transition to independence.
In relation to Angola, we reaffirm our support for the Angolan Government peace plan embodied in the Gbadolite Agreements, which were reiterated in Harare and Kinshasa. We are certain that the Angolan people, while relying on their own heroism and determination, will command international solidarity in their search for ways and means to attain peace and national harmony.
There is a new expectation and hope with the coming to power of a new leadership in South Africa. This expectation is not shared, however, by the majority of the South African people, for whom speeches in themselves are no guarantee that serious changes will be effected in South Africa. This attitude is a reflection of the climate of mistrust and scepticism rooted in the minds of the majority of the South African people and in the world at large in view of the past record of frustrated expectation.
This scepticism can be dissipated only if unequivocal and unchallengeable steps are taken or signs of change are shown by the South African authorities-, the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners? the lifting of the ban on political parties and democratic movements} the ending of the state of emergency? and the beginning of a process of negotiation and dialogue in which all South Africans participate. Through the adoption of a set of such measures the regime would guarantee that space would be opened up for ample and peaceful political participation by the entire South African people in decision-making on the fate of their coin try and the planning and building of a just and democratic society in South Africa.
The cessation of regional destabilization would be clear evidence that South Africa is determined to open a new chapter in its relations with the countries of the region. The South African Government thus has an opportunity to prove to the South African people and to the international community its determination to take decisive steps towards the dismantling of the apartheid system aid to take part in the joint efforts of the other countries of the region to build a prosperous southern Africa. We hope that the statements made by South African leaders are harbingers of vigorous steps to be taken in this direction in the future.
The current regional and international climate is favourable to the search for a solution to the problem of South Africa. On the other hand, the Organization of African Unity's Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, meeting in Harare in August 1989, adopted a set of principles that could form the basis for a frank dialogue by all South Africans. We urge the South African authorities to seize this opportunity to put an end once and for all to the apartheid system and build a new society in South Africa.
We visualize a South Africa with neither minorities nor majorities based on the colour of skin or on race, a South Africa based on political options, a society where criteria for taking part in the Government or in political aid social life are not determined in racial terms but in terms of one's commitment to the ideal of building a just, democratic aid non-racial society.
The apartheid regime is universally condemned not only because it is a white minority regime, but also because, above all, it represents a political option of a minority, a political option based on an anachronism - institutionalised racial discrimination. In South Africa itself there is an increasing number of whites who dissociate themselves from that option of the minority in order to join the cause of the majority.
That development is a sign of the emergence of a new South African society where whites aid blacks, Indians or mixed-race individuals - in a word, all races - can live in harmony in a South Africa free of apartheid. It is that South Africa free of apartheid that we believe should be able to contribute with its resources to the common effort of the countries of the region to make southern Africa a politically stable, economically developed, aid prosperous region.
In other regions of our continent we are witnessing steady efforts aimed at the peaceful settlement of disputes in the context of our African tradition aid with respect for the principles of the OAU and the United Nations. In this context, we are pleased with the recent accords between Chad end Libya. We are certain that the same spirit will guide the efforts being made towards the solution of other problems between African States.
Concerning the Western Sahara conflict, we commend the meetings between His Majesty King Hassan II and the POLISARIO Front. It is our conviction that the relevant OAU and United Nations resolutions continue to be the valid legal and political framework for a just and negotiated settlement of the conflict. We encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts with a view to achieving a speedy solution of the Western Sahara problem.
On the Middle East, we view as a matter of urgency the convening of an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestinian State.
In the Indo-China peninsula, the initiatives to find a political solution to the Cambodian conflict are encouraging. We commend the steps taken by Vietnam aimed at facilitating national reconciliation in Cambodia.
In connection with Afghanistan, we ask the parties to the Geneva Agreements strictly to fulfil the provisions of that accord, in order to bring about peace and national reconciliation.
We reaffirm our solidarity with the cause of reunification of the Korean nation.
The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its desire to see a frank and serious dialogue between all parties involved in East Timor, with a view to ensuring that the right of the people of that Territory to self-determination is fully respected. In this regard, we hold the view that as long as the fundamental rights of the East Timorese people are not taken into account, there can be no long-lasting, internationally acceptable solution to a war that has claimed more than 200,000 lives. The current international climate, which is conducive to dialogue and the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts, should be an inspiration to all parties involved in the Timor conflict. We commend the Secretary-General for his efforts to resolve the problem.
In Central America, we are encouraged by the recent agreements on Nicaragua signed in Honduras, as well as the latest peace initiatives in El Salvador. The restoration of peace and stability, so much desired by the peoples of that region of the American continent, depends, to a large degree, on the implementation of these agreements.
For the People's Republic of Mozambique, the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace is a constitutional principle. Thus, we appeal to the international community to make a concerted effort to ensure the holding of the Colombo Conference on the Indian Ocean in 1990.
In the economic field, the continuing existence of a set of adverse factors that work against the development of the countries of the third world remains a major concern in the context of our own efforts to break away from underdevelopment. The lade of concrete actions aimed at structural transformation upon which the success of our economic plans depends is the cause of the problem.
We note in that regard that, three years after the launching of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, the economic situation in our continent remains critical. Little has been achieved in the implementation of that important Programme adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly. The situation is largely due to the lack or slow implementation of concrete and effective measures in support of the Programme. We therefore appeal to the international community, in particular to the developed countries, to give top priority to the assistance and aid to African countries that would enable us to face the crisis and reactivate our economic and social development.
Our economies continue to be subjected to the unrelenting deterioration of the terms of exchange, where the costs of imports are increased while the prices of export products have fallen dramatically. There has also been an increase in interest rates, a drop in the flow of external funding, and an increase in the net transfer of real resources from South to North. The cumulative effect of the external debt must be added to these factors.
The external debt remains one of the major obstacles to economic growth aid development. This crucial problem deserves our greatest attention through a constructive aid realistic dialogue between debtors aid creditors on the basis of a spirit of mutual understanding, with a view to finding a solution. We wish at this time to express our deepest appreciation to all those coin tries that, in this spirit, undertook concrete measures in order to alleviate the burden of external debt of the countries with the greatest economic difficulties, as in the case of Mozambique.
The People's Republic of Mozambique considers it of fundamental importance for the international community to rally its efforts in order to restructure the present world economic system. To this effect, we are in favour of the launching of global negotiations, for which we retain great hope. They are a starting-point for the resolution of the problems that hinder harmony in international economic relations. The establishment of a new international economic order, in which relations of co-operation between States are based on justice, equity, and mutual benefit, is a fundamental necessity in the democratisation of the world economic system.
Finally, we express the hope that the work of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, to be held in April 1990, will be a success. We are certain that, to a large extent, a new dynamic in the economies of the developing countries in the next decade hinges on the success of the session.
In conclusion, we should like to reiterate our firm conviction that for a whole set of problems that besiege humanity today the United Nations remains the privileged forum, the one that offers us the best opportunities for exchanging ideas aid co-ordinating our efforts to resolve these problems.
","The current session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity to make an assessment of the avenues we have explored thU3 far in the search for ways aid means more conducive to a future of peace and stability in our world. The latter were informed of our 12-point peace initiative by the leaders of certain Mozambican religious denominations that initiated contacts with the ringleaders of the armed bandits with a view to persuading them to stop the massacres and destruction and to reconcile themselves with their fatherland and the people. Through the adoption of a set of such measures the regime would guarantee that space would be opened up for ample and peaceful political participation by the entire South African people in decision-making on the fate of their coin try and the planning and building of a just and democratic society in South Africa. We therefore appeal to the international community, in particular to the developed countries, to give top priority to the assistance and aid to African countries that would enable us to face the crisis and reactivate our economic and social development. We wish at this time to express our deepest appreciation to all those coin tries that, in this spirit, undertook concrete measures in order to alleviate the burden of external debt of the countries with the greatest economic difficulties, as in the case of Mozambique."
44,1989,JPN,"ï»¿
I should like first, on behalf of the Government and people of Japan, to express ây heartfelt congratulations to you, Ambassador Garba, on your election as President of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, I am confident that your wealth of experience and keen insight will ensure that this will be a very productive session. You may be assured that the Japanese delegation will be unstinting co-operating with you as you carry out your solemn responsibilities.
At the same time, I express my sincere respect for the many outstanding accomplishments of Mr. Caputo during his tenure as President of the forty-third session. Founded with the maintenance of world peace as its most important objective, the United Nations has played a very positive role in resolving many issues that have confronted the international community. Most recently its efforts to effect Namibia's transition to independence and its guest for a peaceful solution to the Central American conflict have earned it world-wide praise and high expectations as to the success of its future endeavours. Indeed, success has restored the authority of the United Nations, a situation I sincerely welcome. Underlying the enhancement of these United Nations activities for world peace have been major changes in the state of international relations. Yet success would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of the United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and others concerned. On this occasion I convey to them my profound respect and appreciation.
The international community is today in the midst of a major transition from discord to dialogue, from conflict to co-operation. We are entering upon a new era, in which we must confront the global challenges of bringing about lasting solutions to regional conflicts, sustaining prosperity, preserving the environment, and building a society based solidly on respect for human rights.
Looking first at relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, we are pleased to see dialogue taking root and expanding in a diversity of realms. In particular, we welcome the latest round of talks that was held just last week and look forward to further progress in that dialogue. In Europe we see progress being made in talks on conventional forces and on confidence- and security-building measures. Sino-Soviet relations have been normalized. Determined efforts are being made for reform in many of the socialist countries. All of these are welcome developments. The positive changes in East-West relations have also given new impetus to the drive to negotiate peaceful solutions to regional issues and regional conflicts. In addition to the transition to independence in Namibia and the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Central America, the effort to achieve peace in Cambodia entered a new stage with the holding of the International Conference in Paris this summer.
However, while a start has been made in resolving regional conflicts and stabilizing these areas, the achievement of a comprehensive solution to any of these issues will not be easy. Although foreign troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan and a cease-fire has been implemented between Iran and Iraq, it cannot be said that these areas are truly at peace. Likewise, on the issue of peace in the Middle East, even though there have been some new developments, substantive progress has yet to be made. The situation in Lebanon is also very worrisome.  As for the Asian region, some developments in line with the new thinking in the Soviet Union are discernible in, for example, the Sino-Soviet relationship,
the situation in Cambodia, and the Afghan problem, m the light of these developments, Japan hopes further to strengthen and expand the political dialogue being actively pursued with the Soviet Union and realize a genuine improvement in the bilateral relationship, including the resolution of the Northern Territories issue. I would stress that, beyond improving Japan-Soviet relations, this would constitute an important step towards enhancing peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and improving East-West relations as a whole.
Recent events in China stunned the world and had a strong impact on the feelings of the Japanese people toward China. Nevertheless, Japan's expectations for China's policy of reform and opening up to the outside world remain unchanged, and I hope that the Chinese Government will pay due heed to world opinion and strive to regain the confidence of the international community.
A new era is also dawning in the quest for global prosperity. The world economy is generally experiencing satisfactory growth, and the newly industrializing economies are achieving remarkable levels of development. Further, all the countries concerned are making a determined effort to see that negotiations in the Uruguay Round achieve substantive results by the end of 1990. Japan will continue to strive to ensure that progress is made in these negotiations. Yet, when we look at the world economy as a whole, it is clear that there are still a number of problems standing in the way of sound world economic development, not the least of which are the persistent massive external imbalances and the threat of protectionist pressures, the deteriorating economic situation in the world's poorest countries, including those in Africa, and the enormous burden of debt in countries of Latin America and other parts of the world.
At the same time, we are faced with the stark reality of an accelerating threat to the global environment, the soundness of which is an absolute prerequisite for the prosperity of the world. Moreover, human rights continue to be abused and there are still massive exoduses of refugees in many parts of the world. All of these are international concerns that demand the attention of the entire international community.
In the context of these changes, as Japan interacts with the rest of the world more intensively and in a broader spectrum of fields, it realizes that it must play a more active role in international affairs. Early this year, we were honoured by the many envoys from all over the world who came to Japan to pay their condolences at the time of Emperor Showa's funeral. I wish on this occasion to express, on behalf of the Government of Japan, my profound gratitude. That experience has made us all the more keenly aware of the importance of Japan's international role. With the aim of contributing to a better world, Japan has launched an International Co-operation Initiative to foster world peace and prosperity. The three elements of the Initiative are: strengthening Japan's co-operation as it actively participates and co-operates in the effort to establish and sustain world peace; expanding its official development assistance to contribute to growth in developing countries! and strengthening international cultural exchange to encourage greater understanding among the different cultures of the world. Expanding upon this Initiative, Japan is also devoting its attention to the environment and other global issues. The Kaifu Administration, which was formed in August of this year, is developing an activist foreign policy stance as one of its major objectives, and is determined to do everything in its power to create a world of peace and
prosperity, and an international community that is more just and more responsive to human needs.
I should like next to say a few words about the role of the United Nations and Japan's contribution to it in the light of its position as I have just outlined it.
If we are to achieve and maintain world peace and stability it is imperative that we find fundamental solutions to the regional conflicts and regional problems that even today are taking countless lives and causing immense suffering across the globe. Although first steps have been taken towards settling these conflicts, comprehensive solutions have yet to be achieved, and in many instances efforts are now at a crucial stage.
looking at the decade-long conflict in Cambodia, the recent Paris conference offered an historic opportunity for the parties directly involved, and other interested countries, to assemble for intensive discussions and negotiations. While the conference did not result in a comprehensive political settlement, and no agreement was reached on the establishment of an international control mechanism, there were a number of significant developments, including the dispatch of a fact-finding team, as suggested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We believe it is imperative for everyone concerned to make an even greater effort to ensure that true peace is restored to Cambodia. I very much hope that this session of the General Assembly will provide added momentum towards peace in Cambodia.
It should be noted that international control remains important at every stage of the peace process in Cambodia. The mechanism for international control should be truly universal and fair, should possess a wide range of experience and expertise, and should have the support of and access to a broad range of human and financial resources, lb understand this is to realize that such a mechanism must be established within the framework of the United Nations.
As an Asian neighbour, Japan has stated clearly its intention seriously to consider providing necessary financial cooperation, personnel, refugee repatriation assistance, and other support for the establishment of an international control mechanism to help settle the Cambodian problem, the major cause of instability in the region. In addition, Japan has proposed that an international reconstruction committee be established to provide the international framework for Cambodia's recovery once peace has been restored. I am pleased that this proposal was accepted in principle at the recent international conference. Japan is determined to cooperate with the other countries concerned and to continue its steadfast efforts for the ultimate attainment of a comprehensive political settlement.
As regards the Angola-Namibian issue, I very much welcome the fact that, with last December's tripartite agreement, progress has been made towards resolving the problems in Angola, and genuine progress continues to be made in the process of Namibia's transition to independence. Namibian independence has great historical and symbolic significance as it marks the attainment of the objective of decolonisation on the African continent. The United Nations is now making an Organization-wide effort to ensure that this transition goes smoothly, an effort that has won broad international acclaim. This is the sort of effort that only the United Nations can undertake, and is a further demonstration of the useful role it can play. Consistent with its desire to co-operate for peace, Japan is providing about 30 people to take part in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group monitoring the constituent assembly elections scheduled for this November.
In Afghanistan, civil war continues, and the situation remains a source of deep concern. Japan believes that the establishment of a broad-based government reflecting the popular will is absolutely essential to the attainment of true stability in that country. Japan is therefore cooperating actively by making contributions through the Office of the United Nations Coordinator for Afghanistan and by providing personnel needed for medical assistance and infrastructural improvements to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan refugees. It does so in the hope that peace will be restored to Afghanistan as soon as possible through the determined efforts of the Afghan people themselves to resolve their problems and that the refugees will soon be able to return to their country safely and with honour.
Turning to the Iran-Iraq conflict, Japan highly appreciates the maintenance of the cease-fire through the presence of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. However, even one year after the implementation of the cease-fire, the peace negotiations have yet to bear fruit. I very much hope that both sides will approach these negotiations with determination and flexibility so that a comprehensive peace can be achieved in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Japan will continue to give its full support to the Secretary-General's mediation efforts and will extend all possible cooperation for the settlement of this conflict.
Although there have been a number of noteworthy initiatives since the Congress of the Palestine National Council met late last year, including the proposal for elections in the occupied territories, I cannot but be concerned by the lack of  substantive progress in the Middle East peace process. As the intifadeh continues, the situation in the occupied territories deteriorates further. I wish to pay a high tribute to the ongoing and determined efforts of the parties concerned towards the prompt achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace, I strongly hope that their efforts will result in a concrete plan. In support of the efforts of the parties concerned to achieve peace, Japan intends to step up its high-level political dialogue with the Arab countries concerned, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. At the same time, it is seeking to expand its assistance to the Palestinian people. We must not turn our back on the situation in Lebanon. I very much hope that the parties concerned will exercise maximum restraint, and that a way will be found to end the fighting and to achieve national reconciliation. In this regard, I pay a high tribute to the activities of the League of Arab States and particularly to the Tripartite Committee. Resolutely opposed to all forms of terrorism, hostage-taking, and other inhumane acts, Japan strongly appeals for the immediate release of all hostages.
South Africa's system of racial discrimination is intolerable, and must be completely dismantled without delay. I sincerely hope that the new Government established in that country will take concrete and effective steps to abolish
apartheid. For its part, Japan will continue to co-operate with the rest of the international community in pressing South Africa to lift the state of emergency, release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners, legalize the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations, aid promptly initiate dialogue with representatives of various sectors of the black population. At the same time, Japan is actively supporting the victims of South African apartheid and is extending assistance to the other countries of southern Africa. In Central America, we welcome the progress that has been made in the peace process, with the United Nations playing a role in line with the agreement reached at the meeting of the presidents of the five Central American countries. As part of its support for the Organization's activities, Japan is prepared to provide personnel for the United Nations elections-monitoring commission for the general
elections scheduled to take place in Nicaragua next February. Japan is also considering what form of co-operation it can extend in the security verification mechanism and other areas.
The issue of the Korean peninsula is primarily one to be settled peacefully through direct dialogue between the authorities of the South and of the North. Japan hopes that progress will be made in constructive and substantive South-North dialogue. It has a high regard for the vigorous efforts that the Republic of Korea has made towards that end since 7 July 1988, when President Roh Tae Wbo issued the Special Declaration in the Interest of National Self-esteem, Unification and Prosperity. The exchanges between the Republic of Korea and various Socialist countries that are taking place in the wake of last year's Seoul Olympics are to be encouraged as a means of relaxing tensions on the peninsula.
In the light of this new situation, Japan is working to improve relations with North Korea, with due regard for maintaining the international political balance. Japan hopes to contribute to the creation of a climate conducive to dialogue between South Korea and North Korea. Moreover, we would welcome and support United Nations membership for South and North, whether simultaneous or separate, as an interim measure towards the goal of unification of the peninsula. This would also enhance the universality of the United Nations.
As we have seen, the United Nations has played an important role in settling regional conflicts around the globe, especially in the peace-keeping field. Yet the United Nations mission to prevent and eliminate the threat of conflicts is ju3t as important as its peace-keeping operations are once conflict has broken out. Even when prevention proves impossible, efforts must be made to settle a conflict before it on escalate. Last year the Declaration on the prevention of disputes, which was jointly proposed by Japan and five other countries, was adopted by the General Assembly, while recognizing the roles to be played by Member States, the Security Council and the General Assembly, the Declaration calls on the Secretary-General to approach directly the countries concerned, when necessary, in an effort to prevent conflict and to consider sending fact-finding missions to regions where conflict is imminent.
Japan is determined to extend all possible co-operation to settle regional conflicts in all parts of the world and to the United Nations peace-making and Peace-keeping activities. Very broadly speaking, Japan's co-operation for peace is grounded in the following four principles. First, in addition to supporting fully the Secretary-General's peace-making initiatives, Japan focuses its diplomatic efforts on extending all possible co-operation for the settlement of regional conflicts.  Secondly, Japan is striving to extend as much financial support as possible to United Nations peace-keeping activities, and will strengthen its co-operation by providing personnel in areas where a Japanese role would be appropriate. Just as, in the past, it has extended voluntary contributions as circumstances demanded this August, made a contribution towards the establishment of a fund to strengthen peace-keeping activities so that new peace-keeping aerations may be initiated without delay once the settlement of a regional conflict is reached. I f call upon other member States to support this fund.
Thirdly, Japan is determined to strengthen its support for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other forms of relief extended to people made refugees by regional conflicts in various parts of the world.
Fourthly, Japan provides all possible co-operation after a conflict has been a solved so that the land and economy of the country ravaged by war may be restored a d the lives of the people stabilized and improved. Arms control and disarmament is an issue critically important to the preservation of lasting world peace and stability. Japan is making ever greater g forts in this regard, in recognition of the fact that world peace is essential to 2- ; own security.
Japan welcomes the progress being made in the strategic arms reduction talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, and in the negotiations on forces in Europe, and hopes that it will contribute to a further stabilization of East-West relations. In the United Nations, in the Conference on D -armament, and in other multilateral disarmament efforts, significant progress h been made towards a chemical weapons ban. In an effort to conclude such a Comprehensive ban promptly, the countries concerned continued to negotiate at the Paris Conference last January and, again, at the International (? eminent-Indus try Conference against Chemical Weapons held this month in
Canberra. I express my high appreciation of the initiative towards the global elimination of chemical weapons outlined yesterday by President Bush. Encouraging, too, are the serious efforts that are continuing in the nuclear disarmament field in preparation for next year's review of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Mi clear Weapons.
Appropriate verification measures are essential to the attainment of effective arms control and disarmament, and in recent years greater ingenuity has been called for in this area. Pooling all of its technical capabilities, Japan is taking the initiative in the establishment of an international test verification network for the nuclear test ban. Also, it has drawn upon its position as a country having a sophisticated chemicals industry to make constructive proposals for the establishment of means of verification of a ban on chemical weapons.
Consistent with those disarmament efforts, Japan acted as host to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament Issues this April in Kyoto. The Conference was highly successful in contributing to an enhanced awareness of the need for an international nuclear test verification network and in reaffirming the complementary nature of United States-Soviet disarmament efforts and the multilateral disarmament efforts being made in the United Nations and other forums. Japan is second to none in the co-operation it extends to international efforts for arms control and disarmament in the United Nations and in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.
To achieve the sustained prosperity of the international community, we must work for growth in developing countries. It is imperative that all countries co-operate by taking a global perspective. So far, Japan has systematically enhanced its overseas development assistance and contributed vigorously to supporting and strengthening the economic development and adjustment efforts of developing countries. At present, Japan is making a determined effort to meet its fourth mid-term target. At the same time, Japan decided this July to expand its programme of recycling no less than $US 30 billion over a three-year period starting in 1987, to become a programme of recycling at least $US 65 billion over a five-yea, period starting in 1987. Seeking to support the new strategy on the debt of developing countries, Japan is working to earmark a total of at least $US 10 billion of this enhanced capital recycling programs for untied capital support to countries eligible for this debt strategy.
Special consideration should be directed to the plight of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, given that they face increasingly harsh difficulties as a result, inter alia, of sluggish commodity markets, slow growth, trade deficits and snowballing debt. Japan has announced that, in addition to the total of approximately $us 500 million in non-project grant capital assistance that it is currently disbursing, it is prepared to provide a total of about 3US 600 million in the three-year period starting in 1990, to support the efforts of these countries to restructure their economies. At the same time, starting this fiscal year, Japan is taking additional measures and is implementing grant assistance for debt relief, on past yen credits extended to the least developed countries, of approximately $us 5.5 billion in principal.
I should like to emphasize the important role the United Nations and related organizations play in the development of developing countries, in addition to continuing its support for United Nations operational activities such as the United Nations Development Programme, Japan intends to take an active part in the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and the preparations for an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade, all of which are scheduled for next year.
Mankind is today at an epochal turning point. The invention of the steam engine in the late eighteenth century completely transformed the social and economic structures that had been developed through the course of human history. From the nineteenth century to the middle of the present century, the pace of technological advance accelerated with the development of synthetic chemicals and progress in nuclear engineering, petro-chemistry and materials and electronic engineering, and society rode an unbroken wave of development. Flushed with that success, we turned our gaze outward towards space, downward to develop the technology to explore the ocean floor and, finally, inward to biotechnology with its promise to unlock the secrets of life. At the same time, rapid advances in communications satellites have made possible the real-time exchange of information and image-reception everywhere, making the world a single informational global village.
These dramatic scientific and technological advances offer unlimited potential for the solution of the problems confronting mankind. If we are to realize that potential we must make constant progress in basic scientific fields. The promotion of joint international research through the exchange of scientists and the exchange and transfer of technology will be important in effectively mobilizing financial and human resources in those fields.  On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that if the dramatic expansion of economic activity which is an outgrowth of scientific advance were to proceed in a way that would destroy the balance in the planet's ecosystem the global damage weald be irrevocable,. In just these past 30 years - the blink of an eye in the vast continuum of history - during which mankind has ventured to the far reaches of space and has sought to explore the oceans- depths, there has been an ominous acceleration in the pace of environmental destruction. The health of the planet is gravely threatened by global warming, the destruction of the ozone layer, the depletion of tropical rain forests, acid rain and desertification. The global environmental problems that confront us today must be dealt with by the entire international community working together. Our generation has a solemn responsibility to preserve the natural beauty around us and rebuild a healthy global environment so as to secure the future of coming generations.
The protection of the natural environment so as to enable all people, regardless of where they live, to lead , comfortable and healthy life is a Prerequisite for the prosperity of the international community. The effects of such problems as environmental destruction, explosive population growth and natural disasters transcend national boundaries and, as problems common to all mankind, present a global challenge to the international community. This is an area where the united Nations, as the international community's most universal organization, must bring all its authority to bear.
Is it not incumbent upon the international commit, today to act quickly and in a concerted manner to take better care of our global environment so as to ensure the continued prosperity of our children and our children's children? Japan believes that should be done by adhering to the following four principles, first, preservation of the global environment while working to attain stable world economic growth; secondly, emphasis on the importance of scientific knowledge as fundamental to the protection of the global environment, thirdly, the imperative of a global response to problems* and, fourthly, due consideration of the situation of developing countries.
Japan has long focused its attention on environmental problems. In accordance with the principles I just outlined, and co-operating multilaterally and bilaterally, Japan intends to mobilize all its scientific and technical capabilities, its experience and its knowledge vigorously to address global environmental problems. As part of those efforts, Japan will continue to support the activities of such international organizations as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Tropical Timber Organization and will aim to increase the aggregate sum of its official development assistance for environmental efforts to approximately 300 billion yen over the next three years.
Further, earlier this month Japan, in co-operation with UNEP, was host in Tokyo to a conference on the global environment. Constructive scientific discussions were held, and recommendations were formulated on the question of what to do about such atmospheric changes as global warming and on the relationship between development and the environment in developing countries. Among the results were the suggestion, made for the first time, of a maximum permissible limit on carbon dioxide emissions and recommendations on measures that both developed and developing countries should take. I believe those recommendations will serve as important guidelines for discussions at this session of the General Assembly and for international efforts prior to the 1992 United Nations conference on the environment and development. Japan, for its part, intends to take part seriously in those endeavours.
A variety of measures must be taken to protect the global environment, and a number of organizations within the United Nations system are implementing meaningful programmes. I believe these international efforts should be further Promoted in an efficient and well co-ordinated manner. Accordingly, I should like to propose that the General Assembly conduct in-depth discussions on measures to enable the United Nations to strengthen policy coordination on global environmental problems throughout the United Nations system. Mitigating the impact of natural disasters is another important objective in the overall effort to preserve the environment for life on this planet. As a country which has taken initiatives in this area, Japan feels particularly gratified that the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction will commence next year. Japan intends to extend technical cooperation and to assist in strengthening activities which would enhance public awareness with respect to the reduction of natural disasters. I should like to take this opportunity to appeal for active participation by all countries in co-operating in this important area.
Along with the preservation of the natural environment, it is important that we create and maintain a social climate in which people everywhere can live without fear, in which their basic rights and freedoms are guaranteed, and in which they can live in health and dignity. Consequently, the international community cannot but be very concerned about the continuing abuses of human rights and the outflows of refugees in every part of the world. The drug problem and international terrorism are likewise very serious international problems. The resolution of global humanitarian problems, the creation of a society respectful of human rights, and the establishment of truly universal values are precisely the global challenges for which the United Nations should mobilize the cooperation of its Member States and international organizations so it can play a more effective role. In the conviction that international co-operation is essential for the solution of the drug and other problems, Japan intends to participate vigorously in United Nations activities in those areas.
There has recently been a succession of landings by boat people on the shores of Japan, and, while it very much hopes that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, other international agencies and the countries concerned can do something to resolve this problem, Japan will make available, to the best of its ability, financial co-operation, resettlement accommodations and other assistance consistent with its long-standing practices.
International co-operation in the medical field is likewise important if we are to create a society in which all people enjoy a healthy and rewarding life. Thanks to the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO), and with the co-operation of every country, smallpox, that scourge of mankind, has been eradicated. And now the world-wide spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clearly demonstrates once again that global co-operation is essential for the prevention and medical treatment of infectious diseases.
Japan has enriched the field of advanced medical technology, combining its knowledge of modern Western medicine with its experience with its own traditional medical science. It has also achieved a society whose members enjoy the greatest average longevity in the world. Japan intends to contribute its scientific know-how, information, technology and experience, both in the form of multilateral co-operation through WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations, and in the form of cooperative bilateral efforts in order to enhance co-operation in such areas as public hygiene, the prevention of epidemics, health education and dissemination of primary health care, as well as clinical medicine and research.
As we enter this age of dramatic change, it is only right that the focus and priorities of United Nations activities should likewise change. The goal of the administrative and fiscal reforms no, being pursued is to enable the United Nations to remake itself into a more effective Organization, one better able to respond to the changes in the international community, by moving away from issues that have lest their urgency and mobilizing its human and financial resources to meet the new global challenges. Thanks to the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and everyone else concerned, the three-year programme for administrative and fiscal reform will be brought to a conclusion at the end of this year. 
But this should not be the end of our longer-term efforts to make the United Nations more effective and flexible. Any organization that hopes to avoid stagnation and gain resilience must continually strive for self-renewal. I believe that all Member states should give these efforts to re-invigorate the United Nations their total support. Japan has worked hard to build a country of peace and freedom, in keeping with the national goal of creating an international society in which people everywhere can live in peace, free from fear and want. The United Nations, indispensable as the only truly universal organization we have, has shown the way by illuminating the ideals of such a society. Yet it must be noted that even the United Nations, despite the expansion of its activities and its many achievements in, for example, humanitarian relief and operational activities since its founding in 1945, has at times been forced to retreat from these lofty ideals, at times appearing disengaged or powerless in the face of a difficult international situation. Nevertheless, the true worth of any  organization or agency is determined by the will and attitudes of its members.
In that sense the United Nations is an accurate reflection of the international community. It is the will and attitudes of its Member States that determine how the United Nations is utilized, whether it moves closer to its ideals of international peace and prosperity or is forced to lower its sights and retreat.
Emerging from a course of introspection and reforms upon which it embarked on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary, the United Nations today seems to be experiencing a renaissance as we approach the next half-century. As long as Member States make a determined effort through the United Nations, and strive to meet such urgent global challenges as attaining peace and making progress in disarmament, sustaining prosperity, resolving environmental problems and establishing a society in which human dignity is respected, then world-wide trust in the United Nations and expectations concerning its future role can only increase.
The United Nations has a major role to play and we, its Member States, have grave responsibilities to fulfil in ensuring the international community's stability and prosperity in the 1990s. Ever since becoming a Member, Japan has 
attached great importance to the United Nations. Its trust in the Organization is unwavering, and its expectations of the role it has to play remain undiminished. As a responsible member of the global community and as a staunch supporter of the international order, Japan is determined to do its utmost within the United Nations to create a world of peace and prosperity and an international community that is more just and more responsive to human needs.
","As for the Asian region, some developments in line with the new thinking in the Soviet Union are discernible in, for example, the Sino-Soviet relationship,
the situation in Cambodia, and the Afghan problem, m the light of these developments, Japan hopes further to strengthen and expand the political dialogue being actively pursued with the Soviet Union and realize a genuine improvement in the bilateral relationship, including the resolution of the Northern Territories issue. Last year the Declaration on the prevention of disputes, which was jointly proposed by Japan and five other countries, was adopted by the General Assembly, while recognizing the roles to be played by Member States, the Security Council and the General Assembly, the Declaration calls on the Secretary-General to approach directly the countries concerned, when necessary, in an effort to prevent conflict and to consider sending fact-finding missions to regions where conflict is imminent. Special consideration should be directed to the plight of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, given that they face increasingly harsh difficulties as a result, inter alia, of sluggish commodity markets, slow growth, trade deficits and snowballing debt. I should like to emphasize the important role the United Nations and related organizations play in the development of developing countries, in addition to continuing its support for United Nations operational activities such as the United Nations Development Programme, Japan intends to take an active part in the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and the preparations for an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade, all of which are scheduled for next year. Japan intends to contribute its scientific know-how, information, technology and experience, both in the form of multilateral co-operation through WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations, and in the form of cooperative bilateral efforts in order to enhance co-operation in such areas as public hygiene, the prevention of epidemics, health education and dissemination of primary health care, as well as clinical medicine and research."

The election of Ambassador Garba of Nigeria to the presidency of the forty 'fourth session of the General Assembly is a recognition of his great diplomatic skills and a confirmation of the effective role that Nigeria plays on the African and the international scene. While extending to him our warmest congratulations, I wish also to express my appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, who conducted the deliberations of the last session with such wisdom. I also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his efforts and his activities designed to achieve just settlements to urgent international issues.
Undoubtedly, there are now positive trends in international relations.
Foremost among those is the steady improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, where confrontation and mistrust have given way to understanding, detente and co-operation. While welcoming the agreement reached between the two countries on halting the arms race end on disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, we believe that what has been achieved so far is only a small portion of what we aspire to achieve in this field. Further steps are still needed for the reduction of nuclear strategic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction which constitute a threat to life on our planet. Only then will our efforts be in the right direction to implement the will of the international community and the strategy agreed upon for general aid complete disarmament under effective international control.
Naturally, the positive developments on the international scene have had a positive impact also at the regional level in different parts of the world, enabling this international Organization to play its role in achieving political settlements of a number of questions that remain of concern to the international community. In this context, bringing an end to the destructive war between Iraq and Iran has been a major success for the peace efforts of the international community. We take this opportunity to appeal to both countries to break the deadlock that has stalled negotiations to end their dispute and achieve progress towards the desired settlement and the complete and comprehensive peace that will guarantee the interests of both peoples. We also hope that the two countries can reach an agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war in the immediate future.
In connection with Afghanistan, the Geneva Agreements represent a valid framework for a political settlement that guarantees the interests of the Afghan people. We call upon all concerned parties to remain committed to those agreements.
As regards the new developments in the Horn of Africa, we welcome the current efforts to halt the fighting and to move to the negotiating table with a view to reaching peaceful solutions to the problems of the region.
In Western Sahara, there are certain new developments of a positive nature. The same applies to the situation in Kampuchea, from which all the Vietnamese forces have recently withdrawn, thus paving the way for a peaceful settlement that would guarantee the security and stability of that region.
We appreciate and welcome the agreement arrived at among the leaders of the States of Central America. All parties concerned are called open to provide favourable conditions to guarantee the effective implementation of those agreements, in a creative manner, so that peace stability can prevail in that region.
We also hope that it will be possible to reach a just settlement to the Cyprus problem that will guarantee the unity of Cyprus, its territorial integrity and its non-aligned status. The same is true of the Korean question, whose solution requires the achievement of a settlement guaranteeing the unification of Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis. Today, we are following with interest the completion of the process of independence for Namibia in accordance with the United Nations plan. We look forward to the day when independent Namibia aid its people can stand side by side with the other members of the international community and participate in its work. But this positive development should not lead us to abandon our common efforts to eradicate the policy of apartheid, or our continued support for the struggle of the people of South Africa for freedom.
It is regrettable that the positive climate prevailing in international relations has had no impact on the situation in the Middle East, where the Palestinian question, which is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, still remains without a just and comprehensive settlement that would guarantee the national inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
The fact that cannot be ignored is that the Palestinian leadership  represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, has proved beyond any doubt its keen interest in achieving peace in the region well as its positive response to international efforts made to that end. The decisions of the Palestine National Council have been positively received on the Arab and international levels. They also were endorsed by the emergency Arab summit meeting held in Casablanca. They were crowned by the positive initiative that Chairman Yasser Arafat announced before the General Assembly in Geneva. It goes without saying that the increasing international recognition of the State of Palestine reaffirms the belief of the international community in the legitimacy of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its serious endeavours to reach a just and comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian question. 
This positive initiative has been accompanied by the steadfastness of the Palestinian people's intifadah in the occupied territories. From this rostrum we salute the continued courage of the Palestinian people engaged in an in equal confrontation with the Israeli occupation, it is important to state that Israel's true image has been clearly revealed to world public opinion. Does any doubt still persist about the fact that Israel does not want peace to prevail in the region? Does any doubt still persist about another fact that Israel's policy is based on expansion and colonial settlement? Has it not yet been proved beyond any doubt through clear, tangible, irrefutable evidence, that Israel violates human rights in the occupied territories? Has the world forgotten the crimes committed by Israel against the defenceless Palestinian people, burying them alive and breaking their bones?
The international community as a whole calls for terminating the Israeli occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories. It calls for seizing the opportunity to proceed with the preparations for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, in accordance with numerous successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. That is the right approach, agreed upon internationally  it would lead to a just political settlement in the Middle East that would guarantee the national inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their independent State.  
We take this opportunity to call m the United States to adopt a positive attitude towards the international efforts for peace, and to associate itself with the will of the international community, within the agreed-upon framework for a political settlement in the Middle East, in order to enable the Security Council to take the practical measures for the preparation for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East. We also call upon the United States to use its influence to bring pressure to bear on Israel in order to make it respond favourably to the international peace efforts. 
The success of Arab efforts, as represented by the Arab Tripartite Committee in making some important steps on the road to restoring security and stability to Lebanon is a development which we highly appreciate and of which we are proud. The halting of fighting between brothers and the gradual restoration of normal life to brotherly Lebanon are indeed important developments. We ate all the more pleased to witness the success or the Arab Tripartite Committee in convening the Lebanese House of Representatives in Taif, Saudi Arabia, and we hope that a political settlement guaranteeing the unity, security and stability of Lebanon will be reached.
At the same time, we once again demand the immediate and unconditional termination of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, in accordance with are relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
In the context of the Middle East, we reiterate our warning against ignoring Israeli nuclear armaments and the risk this poses to the region and its peoples, as well as the potential threat it entails to international peace and security. In this respect, we demand the taking of immediate measures to end this danger, a danger that runs counter to the desire of the peoples and States of the region to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the area. We also warn against the risk of Israeli missile-launching tests in the Mediterranean and the threat such tests pose to the peace and security of the States in that region, particularly since one of these missiles landed close to the territory of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.
Man  speakers have made particular reference to certain items on this session's agenda according to their own concerns and priorities. We should like to confirm our country's position on some of those issues. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including State terrorism. Me censure using this subject as a slogan to strike at national liberation movements and stifle their legitimate struggle for freedom and self-determination or to interfere in the internal affairs of other States. We welcome any joint international efforts to confront terrorism to be agreed upon in the international conference proposed for this purpose within the framework of the United Nations. We also support any joint international effort to combat drugs and illegal drug trafficking.
We believe that no one would oppose international efforts for the protection of the environment. However, we reiterate that our starting-point in this context must not only be confined to the protection of the environment from further pollution or degradation but must also take into consideration our belief in the need to develop and improve the environment to serve the socio-economic development of the developing countries.
Above all, our priorities remain based on the social and economic development of the developing countries and ways to promo to that development in order to improve the living standards of our peoples. Hence, we wonder how we can ever boast of the progress achieved both regionally and internationally in the political and security spheres if this is not accompanied by parallel progress in the economic field that is so closely linked to our lives. What kind of peace and security is it if the circle of poverty in the world is increasingly widening and if the gap between the developed aid the developing countries is deepening day by day? And how can we ever guarantee the political stability of the world if it is threatened daily by an exacerbated economic aid social situation?
The stagnation which has marked the process of growth and development in developing countries and the negative growth rates of their economies have readied tragic proportions. Still worse is the suffering of the foreign debt-ridden States, and that of the least developed countries to which we belong. 
Our situation is made even worse by the national disasters we face. Like many other least developed countries. Democratic Yemen was struck by torrential rains and floods that caused great loss of life and inflicted much damage end destruction on economic installations as well as on agricultural land and crops. While once again we express our thanks and appreciation to all States and organizations that provided us with timely emergency relief assistance, we look forward to more economic support to enables to rebuild aid reconstruct vital economic structures that were destroyed by the floods.
The worsening economic situation prevailing in the developing countries requires the adoption of urgent measures aimed at finding just solutions and bringing about essential changes in the structure of international economic relations, and to establish the new international economic order, an order that will contribute to balanced and steady growth, accelerate the process of development in the developing countries, aid deal with the problems of foreign debt, money, finance and trade, as well as other problems affecting the world economy.
In this respect we look forward with keen interest to the convening of the second conference on the least developed countries to be held in Paris be shall make every effort, along with other least developed countries, to come out of that Conference with a clear strategy that will assist our countries in promoting their economies and increasing their growth rates in a way that will guarantee a minimum decent standard of living for our peoples. We attach the same hope to the special session of the General Assembly, to be held in 1990, devoted to international co-operation for development. We deem it necessary to continue the world economic negotiations between the North and the South and to break the current stalemate. We are indeed aware of the requirements of this era in the light of recent developments in international relations. In our country we are undergoing, an important phase of comprehensive political and economic reforms which we regard as a necessary  urgent process dictated by subjective and objective circumstances and the developments experienced by our revolution. The process of political and economic reform is based on certain premises, mainly on pursuing a realistic policy, spreading democracy and openness, promoting the rule of law aid guaranteeing the political, economic, social and human rights of our citizens.
Side by side with this important internal process, our efforts continue on the national level to achieve Yemeni unity, which is the fate, destiny and the aim of our Yemeni people. We believe that the way to achieve this noble goal is peaceful dialogue and brotherly understanding on a set of common denominators between the two sectors of Yemen. It gives us pleasure that our relations with our brothers in the northern sector of the homeland are positive and developing. The implementation of the two important agreements concerning the movement of our citizens between the two sectors and joint oil investment is proceeding smoothly. He look forward to further measures that will pave the way for the restoration of the unity of Yemen, which can only be a factor contributing to further stability aid development in Yemen and in the region as a whole. 
In our relations with our Arab brothers there has been considerable progress. We are keen to strengthen and promote these relations on the basis of mutual respect for independence, national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, for our mutual benefit, in a manner that will serve the interests of our peoples and further our issues of destiny. In this respect, we are working to promote co-ordination with our Arab brothers within the framework of the regional and international organizations to which we belong, so as to achieve stability  id to avoid tension in the area.
The same applies to the remaining neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, and on the basis of the same principles, we are making intensive efforts to improve and develop our relations with the other countries of the world. In this regard, important contacts and visits were made this year. We hope that our pursuit of this objective will be met with an adequate response so that our relations with other countries may be promoted to the level to which we aspire. On the wider international front, we are seeking to expend out activities within the framework of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, with whose members we have common principles and goals.
As one of the Indian Ocean States, Democratic Yemen strongly supports international efforts aimed at making the Indian Ocean Ð° zone of peace. We look forward with interest to the convening of the international Conference on the Indian Ocean next year. In addition, we shall host an international seminar on the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea early next year. The seminar, which is being organized by our Government in co-operation with the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization, will be attended by prominent persons from all parts of the world. 
In the framework of the United Nations, we take pride in the fact that our efforts will be crowned, in this principal international forum, with the confidence expressed in us by the group of Asian States, which we shall represent in the Security Council during the term 1990-1991. We fully understand the dimensions of this responsibility and declare that we shall spare no effort in shouldering it. We shall be the mirror reflecting the Arab position, and the echo of the Asian voice  We shall reflect the principles governing the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as well as the will of the international community to maintain international peace and security, in co-operation and co-ordination with the other members of the Security Council.

The sessions of the General Assembly of our Organization offer Government officials such as ourselves the solemn opportunity both to give the views of our respective countries on the status of the world and to take a look at prospects for its future. I myself am particularly honoured to address the Assembly for the first time on behalf of my country, Gabon.
1 should like first of all to discharge the pleasant duty of conveying to President Joseph Garba, the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations, on behalf of His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, the President of Gabon, and on my own behalf, the warmest fraternal congratulations of the Gabonese people on his brilliant election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The confidence thus demonstrated shows the esteem he enjoys among us, and is a tribute to his outstanding qualities as a man well versed in international affairs and his commitment to the Special Committee against Apartheid, which he chairs. The President may rest assured that in this body the Gabonese delegation will be guided by its firm determination to make a sincere contribution to the success of our work.
It is my delegation's conviction that under the presidency of Joseph Garba the deliberations of the Assembly will proceed in the spirit of the principles and purposes of the Charter of our Organization for the achievement of a just and equitable world.
We should also like to congratulate the members of the Bureau, who are working with the President to ensure the success of our deliberations. We take pleasure in availing ourselves of this opportunity to thank Mr. Garba's predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, and his Bureau for the invaluable work they did during the forty-third session.
To the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, my country would like to pay a well-deserved tribute for the self-sacrifice, talent and complete dedication he has shown in carrying out his difficult tasks. By way of illustration I would mention his recent visit to southern Africa, as well as his participation in both the twenty-fifth summit of the Organization of African Unity and the ninth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement.
With the experience it has acquired from the various trials, tribulations and upheavals that have taken place since its creation, our Organization is more than ever aware of its place and its responsibilities with regard to the destiny of mankind. Each of us must become aware of the need for all Members to take part in world decisions in this body, for without a doubt the United Nations remains, the centre for the harmonizing of the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends.
The signing of the American-Soviet agreement of 8 December 1987 on the dismantling of intermediate-range nuclear missiles? the conclusions of the Belgrade summit last September, and the determination then restated by the non-aligned countries to work towards the building of a better world; the very recent American and Soviet proposals for the elimination of chemical weapons? the tireless activities of the United Nations in these spheres - all have given rise to a climate of detente and confidence truly propitious for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts.
The same applies to Afghanistan, and Gabon hopes that, following the Geneva agreements, as well as the withdrawal of foreign troops, an international and national consensus might emerge to enable the Afghan people to express its legitimate aspirations and devote its resources to the rebuilding of its country without external interference of any kind.
As regards Cambodia, we take pleasure in noting with interest the role played by the ASEAN countries at the Jakarta meetings, and the first peace initiative of France, which has led to the creation of three so-called monitoring, safeguard and refugee committees, as well as to the establishment of an ad hoc committee. The mission of inquiry of the Secretary-General in Cambodia, as well as the establishment of machinery for international monitoring, are not only a useful tool but also and above all a prerequisite for a return to peace in that country.
Concerning the Korean peninsula, my country has always worked for peaceful unification in a framework of sincere joint efforts that take into account the will of the Korean people as a whole, a necessary prerequisite for the genuine representation of that country in our Organization.
Taking advantage of the overall climate of detente, the parties to the Iran-Iraq conflict have agreed to negotiate in Geneva on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We can only welcome this, while exhorting the two parties to commit themselves to doing their utmost to help the Secretary-General in the full implementation of that resolution. That is how they can show their true willingness to achieve peace.
As regards the Middle East crisis, my country has always held the view that its settlement requires the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Arab occupied territories, de jure recognition of the PIO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and free exercise by the latter of its right to self-determination, and its right to have its own State with internationally recognized borders. Gabon, then, fully subscribes to the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the aegis of the United Nations, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.
I commend here the excellent relations Palestine has had with my country, which were manifested in the opening in 1986, in Libreville, of Palestinian diplomatic representation.
We cannot talk about the situation in the Middle East without dealing with the painful problem of Lebanon because above and beyond the ordeal suffered by its people for more than 15 years, it is Lebanon's survival, that should concern us today. Gabon, therefore welcomes the resumption of the work of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League on Lebanon, which should form part of overall broad-based diplomatic action, and supports its efforts to find a lasting solution to this real human tragedy.
As regards the situation in Central America, Gabon hails the conclusion of the Esquipulas II and Tela agreements, which pave the way for the return of peace to that region. It also welcomes the Security Council's firm support for these agreements, which should facilitate the achievement of the objectives set forth in the plan.
I could not conclude this part of my statement without touching on the conflicts that beset our dear continent of Africa.
As regards the Chad-Libya border dispute, the Heads of State and Government, at the twenty-fifth summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), renewed the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, which has been chaired by my country since 1977.
I take pleasure in emphasizing in this connection that the recent conclusion in Algiers of the framework agreement on the settlement of the Chad-Libya border dispute is the logical culmination of the various initiatives of the Ad Hoc Committee and its Chairman. At the twenty-fourth summit of the OAU His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo proposed that pride of place be given, as a necessary prerequisite for peace, to the establishment of a climate of confidence between the two countries and the dynamics of dialogue, bringing the two parties together, which would be very significant. The Angolan issue, also, was dealt with by Heads of State of the African sub region, including the President of Gabon, and they reaffirmed their support for the plan for peace and reconciliation in Angola formulated in the Gbadolite declarations.
In international terms, Gabon would like to express its satisfaction to those countries that have provided military observers and international officials, and to the United Nations for all its technical assistance for the verification mission in Angola. As regards Namibia, my country welcomes the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of that territory. Furthermore, we express full appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts within the framework of Security Council resolutions 629 (1989) and 632 (1989) and urge the South African authorities to co-operate with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in their implementation.
Finally, we are grateful to the Security Council for its vigilance, shown recently in resolution 640 (1989), whereby it requires that all parties concerned, especially South Africa, comply, among other things, with the provisions of resolution 435 (1978).

The process of Namibia's accession to international sovereignty - long overdue - is today irreversible. The desperate manoeuvres at intimidation of the civilian population and the attacks against the leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization - all plots hatched by a minority of proponents with a backward-looking, anachronistic vision of history - cannot stop or delay its implementation.
The situation in Namibia is not the only source of tension in southern Africa. Apartheid, which has become a crime against humanity, is also a considerable source of tension. That is why, now more than ever before, and taking into account current political developments - the results of the sustained action of forces for change within South Africa and of external pressure - Gabon demands that the state of emergency be ended and that all political prisoners, including in particular Nelson Mandela, be released. furthermore, we ask those who still
support that regime to face the facts and to help in the total eradication of that shameful system.
I could not conclude my statement on the political situation in Africa without referring to the burning question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Gabon reaffirms its solidarity with the fraternal people of Comoros and reiterates its determination to continue its efforts to have the Comorian island of Mayotte returned to its homeland. I come now to international economic issues, which various parties have met to discuss. Among other issues, I want to mention the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund, which met in Washington on 31 March 1989 and at which Gabon presided, and the last summit of the seven most industrialized countries held quite recently in Paris.
If we have seen a slight improvement in 1988 and 1989, as compared with previous years, we are bound to note that the developing countries have not really benefited from it. The trend of negative net transfers from our countries to the industrialized world and the international financial institutions, the deterioration in the terms of trade, the increase in international interest rates and a reduction in the gross domestic product of our various countries are the best illustration of this.
As regards the delicate problem of debt, which in 1988, according to the estimates of the World Bank, had reached the outrageous sum of 31,245 billion for all the developing countries taken together, including 3230 billion for African countries alone, it is well known that the current cost of servicing this, by absorbing a growing proportion of export and budgetary income, is undermining adjustment efforts and is a major obstacle to the development prospects of our countries. I . spite of the rescheduling agreed to by creditors, our countries have not yet been able to achieve an overall improvement in the financial balance.
The African countries in particular, with the assistance of international financial institutions, have even set up programmes of structural adjustment in order to cope with their serious indebtedness. The Gabonese Government, for its part, has, since 1986, established an adjustment programme with the objective, on one hand, of remedying the medium-term imbalances, both internal and external, and, on the other hand, of reducing the vulnerability of our countries to fluctuations in the price of oil.
We must admit that these efforts have not yielded all the desired results. Therefore, taking into account the reasons for these distortions, the African countries have advocated, within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), collective steps with a view to tailoring structural adjustment programmes to the specific characteristics of the countries concerned. This approach is in accordance with the general guidelines suggested in the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes for Socio-economic Recovery and Transformation (AAF-SAP) , submitted last July at the fiftieth session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, which adopted it, and by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa. Gabon requests that the General Assembly, in turn, adopt the AAF-SAP and hopes that the Development Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the Group of 24, will do likewise.
Furthermore, my country notes with interest the American initiative - the so-called Brady Plan - and the announcement, by President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand in Dakar, of the intention to write off the public debt of 35 African countries. Even though Gabon aid other medium-income countries have not benefited from this last measure, these are initiatives that we hope will lead to additional resources, and they are a real cause for satisfaction. In any case, they demonstrate the emergence of solidarity between North and South. Gabon, for its part, hopes that
provisions to reduce the volume of trade debt and alleviate the cost of servicing it will be adopted. In this spirit, my country urges the creditor community to be impartial by establishing greater equity in the treatment of debt.
I should like to take this opportunity to salute the Canadian Government for its recent initiative in writing off the debt of medium-income African countries. By and large, the economies of the developing countries will not show real growth so long as the prices of raw materials are not at a level that takes into account the movement in those of manufactured goods and the sluggishness of international markets.
The international detente which we all agree should be emphasized and the development efforts agreed on for my country are aimed at achieving a better life for mankind in a sound environment.
As regards the environment, the perils of the modern world - such as industrial pollution of the air, the warming trend in the planet, the greenhouse effect, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the dumping and storing of waste of all types, to name only a few - call for world-wide attention.
In the face of what might seem to be a brake on progress, my country has adopted measures that should alleviate the repercussions on its people. I am thinking particularly of the establishment, in the Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of Nature, of a national anti-pollution centre and the establishment of a policy on the recycling and treatment of waste produced by our country and programmes to improve and preserve living resources through the reforestation of specific areas. It is in this spirit that, in international terms, my country welcomes the recent decision of the World Bank to include the idea of protection of the environment in the development projects that it finances. We also support the convening, in 1992, of a United Nations conference on the environment and development, described as a development which will help to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs.
Over and above the fears caused by degradation or deterioration of the environment scourges such as the problem of drugs are no less serious in undermining our societies. Although confined, so far, to certain regions, the spectre of this calamity haunts the rest of the world. That situation led my country to convene, in June 1989 its first national seminar on the drug problem, and the recommendations to be adopted will include the setting up of an inter-ministerial committee to combat drugs, the development of a toxicology laboratory in Libreville for regional use, and the introduction of legislation on the use of, and trafficking in, narcotic drugs, adapted to the requirements of the penal code and the public-health code.
These recommendations, which are similar to those enunciated by the President of the United States, and to those contained in the Secretary-General's plan, will we hope, help to stamp out this scourge of our times. Among all the ills that afflict our world today, AIDS is the most mind-boggling. Its lightening-like progression, as well as the devastation it wreaks, are staggering.
Our countries, whose health infrastructures still have to be improved upon, are particularly concerned over this threat and we are following with the greatest of interest the efforts made by researchers the world over to find a cure. Gabon, thanks to its facilities for advanced medical research at the international centre in Franceville, recently organized a symposium on AIDS. We are firmly determined to continue, through this machinery, to make our contribution to the campaign against this terrible illness, and hope to see an intensification and diversification of exchanges with similar facilities in the rest of the world.
The developing countries, committed as we are, along with international financial institutions, to programmes of structural adjustment, cannot overlook the effects of those programmes on the poorest strata of our society, especially the risk of social upheaval, which is bound to threaten international peace and detente.
Thus, after the Bamako Initiative, the proposals made by the United Nations Children's Fund for 'adjustment with a human face' - the only way our countries can hope to begin developing - were welcomed by us.
While efforts made in recent years for international detente are worthy of praise, it seems nevertheless necessary to call the attention of our Assembly to the fact that its gradual establishment has not yet led to significant changes in international relations.
Our times demand that detente not be thought of as immobility, or as a breathing spell for the great Powers, lb the contrary, by its underlying dynamism detente should serve the cause of world peace.
Our common destiny requires that we work towards this together in order to achieve one of the major objectives of our Organization, to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war'.
More than ever it is time to act with determination in order to achieve this end. Our Organization has so many commitments to meet, that only this prospect will allow for the achievement of the ideal of peace, which is the basis of all of Gabon's policies.
Peace, justice and harmony in Africa and in the rest of the world: that is the message that my country wished, through me, from this lofty rostrum, to address to this Assembly.
","The same applies to Afghanistan, and Gabon hopes that, following the Geneva agreements, as well as the withdrawal of foreign troops, an international and national consensus might emerge to enable the Afghan people to express its legitimate aspirations and devote its resources to the rebuilding of its country without external interference of any kind. I take pleasure in emphasizing in this connection that the recent conclusion in Algiers of the framework agreement on the settlement of the Chad-Libya border dispute is the logical culmination of the various initiatives of the Ad Hoc Committee and its Chairman. At the twenty-fourth summit of the OAU His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo proposed that pride of place be given, as a necessary prerequisite for peace, to the establishment of a climate of confidence between the two countries and the dynamics of dialogue, bringing the two parties together, which would be very significant. The trend of negative net transfers from our countries to the industrialized world and the international financial institutions, the deterioration in the terms of trade, the increase in international interest rates and a reduction in the gross domestic product of our various countries are the best illustration of this. We also support the convening, in 1992, of a United Nations conference on the environment and development, described as a development which will help to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs."

Mr. President, I am immensely pleased to be able to participate in a United Nations session, whose stewardship rests in the able hands of such an illustrious son of Africa. The Bangladesh delegation shares the pride that our Nigerian colleagues must feel, as our two countries enjoy such close friendship. May I also felicitate the Bureau upon their election and wish them success in the discharge of their responsibilities. Rich tributes are due to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, for the leadership he provided us during the last session.
I must commence my statement with some words of well-deserved praise for our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His quiet but inspiring diplomacy, his patient endeavours, his courage and perseverance, have helped advance the cause of peace in our times. He has not only carved for himself a niche in our hearts, but has also reserved for himself a place in the pantheon of history.
There is much the United Nations system has achieved, though more remains to be done. None the less, in recent months, the credibility of our Organization has not only been enhanced but the confidence of the global community in its institutions has also taken firm root. Today there is widespread belief that the United Nations has the unique potential and capacity, not only to adjust and accommodate, but also to fashion a concerted response to the multidimensional contemporary problems through a co-operative approach and management.
Last year Bangladesh was devastated by the worst floods in living memory. This Assembly reacted quickly to offer timely succour to the stricken. To help raise resources for longer-term measures a special meeting on assistance to Bangladesh was convened here last year. Since then, vital remedial action has been initiated. A massive national effort was mobilized, under the direct supervision of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, to rehabilitate and reconstruct the affected areas, and to readjust and revitalize their economy. A comprehensive flood- protection programme was formulated. Unparalleled international response, together with the courage and resilience of the people, helped avert the famine and epidemic and the negative growth that were predicted.
We are determined to do all that is possible nationally. However, there is now implicit recognition that disaster control involves co-operation beyond our borders, and resources beyond our modest means. Thus, sustained efforts have been launched bilaterally, regionally and internationally to supplement our national efforts. Special emphasis has been given to the preparation of studies for a durable solution. An international conference on floods in Bangladesh, convened by the World Bank, is scheduled to be held in December this year in London. We hope for your co-operation with a view to its success.
Many of Bangladesh's serious economic problems, severe development constraints and other formidable challenges, exacerbated by environmental degradation, are problems we share with others in a comparable milieu. The decade of the 19 80s has thus been a decade of serious disappointment, bordering on despair, for a majority of the developing countries. The gap between the developed and developing nations during this most turbulent period has increased. Although richer nations were able to pull out of a serious economic recession to enjoy the longest period of economic expansion since the Second World War, the crisis in a vast majority of the developing countries has continued unabated.
Countries in Latin America and Africa have thus remained deeply entrenched in a critical situation. The world's poorest, the least developed countries, continue to be mired in a serious development crisis. Growth in these countries has continued to be either sluggish or even negative. The proportion of 'hard-core poor' in these countries has increased staggeringly. Underlying this precarious situation is the reality that all the important elements for sustained development of developing countries are stalling. Commodity prices, so important for these countries, still remain at an unacceptable low level. External indebtedness continues to take a heavy toll on their economies, and the flow of resources continues, paradoxically, to go from the poor of the developing South to the rich in the North.
The reality of interdependence makes these concerns the concern of every country. In Belgrade, earlier this month, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad had underscored, as an undeniable priority, the need for a global consensus on the approaches towards the solution of these problems. Only such a consensus can lead to a solution. This also requires the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive set of measures that address all aspects of the problems that stifle the development of the developing countries. Substantial opportunity exists during the coming months to spell out elements of such a consensus. I speak of the formulation of a development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade, the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation, and the second United Nations conference on least developed countries, scheduled for 1990 in Paris. In those important events we should start from the fundamental premise that no unilateral solution to our problems is possible. The end to the crisis calls for a global dialogue and readiness to act decisively on a wide front.
Bangladesh, to improve the global economic climate, would call for concerted and urgent action on the following points:
First, there must be a substantial increase in concessionary financial flows to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, and the flow of the world's surplus must be reversed to meet the need for investment in developing countries. Second, measures must be adopted and implemented to reduce and restructure the crushing debt burden. A growth-oriented debt strategy should be directed towards reduction in interest rates, lowering of interest payments, decisive and substantial reduction of debt obligation and outright cancellation of debt of the least developed countries. Third, ways and means must be found to improve the export-earning potential of developing countries through the expansion of markets, trade liberalization by means of fulfilment of the standstill and roll-back commitments undertaken in the Punta del Este Declaration, stabilization of export earnings, and linkage of debt repayment terms to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations. Fourth, the crucial link between trade, development, and debt must be recognized. Fifth, the developing countries must strengthen their efforts to step up the process of scientific and technological development and their consequent ability to adapt to and absorb new technologies. Sixth, we must concentrate on improving the condition of the least developed countries and on drawing them into the mainstream of the international development process. In that respect, the 1990 United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries should adopt a comprehensive plan of action. Seventh, food security must be ensured, including emergency measures to expand food production in the least developed countries, ensuring adequate food reserves, access to food, and the creation of a nutrition, employment and health network for the most vulnerable groups. Finally, human-resource development must be harnessed and mobilized, especially through concentration on an effective basic-needs framework. This should include emphasis on the disadvantaged segments; women, children and the handicapped.
While greater co-operative and urgent action are demanded on the economic front, we can draw comfort from progress made on a number of political issues. These are taking place today on the matrix of a far more relaxed global political backdrop, owing largely to the commendable initiatives and efforts of the super-Powers - the United States and the Soviet Union - their leaders, Governments and peoples. This has created a congenial climate in which the United Nations system can address some specific problems. Guns have fallen silent in the Gulf region, and the bloodletting entailed in the eight years of fierce fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has finally ended. Bangladesh is proud to be a part of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group which today is helping keep the peace. We hope that direct negotiations between the parties will succeed in achieving a comprehensive, just and honourable settlement as envisaged in Security Council resolution 598 (1987) .
In Afghanistan, the Soviet Union deserves to be praised for its commitment to the cause of peace, amply demonstrated by the withdrawal of its troops by 15 February this year. But the suffering of the Afghans has not ceased. Five million refugees, so generously hosted by Pakistan and Iran, have yet to return home. The people of Afghanistan has yet to exercise its inherent right to a system and Government of its choice. The United Nations co-ordinating role must be strengthened in the repatriation of the refugees, the reconstruction of the war-battered country, and the channelling of humanitarian assistance, and in the facilitating of a comprehensive, peaceful settlement in accordance with the Geneva Agreement.
In Cambodia, Viet Nam's offer to withdraw its troops by 30 September, the Jakarta Informal Meeting negotiations, the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and all the parties to the Paris Peace Conference have given rise to a hope for an imminent breakthrough. The recent set-back in Paris must not be allowed to reverse the process. Urgent new attempts need to be made to allow the people of Cambodia freely to determine its own future.
In Namibia, the dawn of freedom is about to break. Its independence has always been a priority item on the United Nations agenda. Bangladesh's total identity with and support for the struggle of the Namibian people have been unswerving. We have been an active participant in the Council for Namibia. As I speak, our soldiers and civilians are on the soil of Namibia as an integral part of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. The leader of our military observer groups died in Namibia in a tragic accident in the performance of his duties. His supreme sacrifice will be vindicated when the yoke of suppression is lifted forever from Namibia. If need be, the United Nations must provide the Secretary-General with the total resources he requires to bring his efforts to fruition.
In divided Cyprus, we welcome the initiation of talks between the two communities without pre-conditions with a view to reaching a negotiated settlement. We hope that the manifest differences will be narrowed. We hope that the contacts between the two Koreas will lead to a reconciliation and a peaceful solution in accordance with the aspirations of the people of that peninsula. In our own region, South Asia, the fourth summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Islamabad in December last year successfully fulfilled its essential mandate in enhancing and consolidating socio-economic co-operation in many new and meaningful directions.
Sadly, some problems remain intractable. In the Middle East, Israel's continued occupation of illegally acquired territories has created an explosive situation. The valiant intifadah of the Palestinian people today serves as a clarion call to mobilize world public opinion against a brutal suppression of freedom. Israel must give up all the Arab territories, including the Golan Heights, that it so wrongly holds. We reiterate our support for the early convening of an international peace conference, of which the Palestine Liberation Organization must be an equal and integral part. The problem of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East crisis and its resolution is a sine qua non for peace in the area.
The hateful system of apartheid continues to bleed South Africa. The pain of the black majority grows more excruciating as thousands, including Nelson Mandela, continue to languish in prison. If Pretoria wishes to attempt to practice what it has now begun to preach, these thousands must be set free and apartheid must be dismantled. The path to freedom may be long, but for the South Africans the journey has begun. Bangladesh endorses the need for sustained support to the front-line States. We endorse the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime.
Disarmament remains, as always, in the forefront of our agenda. The Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles has been a historic step forward. A vital follow-up should be the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons by at least 50 per cent and significant cut-backs in conventional forces. As for Bangladesh, a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, we are constitutionally committed to the goal of general and complete disarmament. We believe, while nuclear disarmament is a priority item, a restraint in conventional arms is both urgent and necessary. We must continue to work towards a comprehensive test ban treaty. The United Nations role in monitoring compliance and verification must be strengthened. Naval arms limitation must be resolutely pursued. A convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States should be concluded. Of vital importance is the need to strengthen security assurances, both positive and negative, to non-nuclear-weapon States. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones across the globe should be encouraged. We must avoid the urge to make weaponry more sophisticated and thus improve its precision and accuracy and increase its propensity for use.
There is a widespread acknowledgement today of the pressing and urgent need for a convention banning chemical weapons. Important progress in the Conference on Disarmament at its summer session must be pushed to an early conclusion. The Paris Conference and the just concluded meeting in Canberra will certainly supplement pressure to that end. The decision to expand the Conference on Disarmament should be given effect. On the question of the Indian Ocean, we firmly believe that the Ad Hoc Committee should speed up preparatory work so that the Conference can be held in Colombo next year.
After years of ignoring alarm signals, concern over environment has new altered deep into our consciousness. The litany of causes and consequences has now become the jargon of everyday mass media usage. Concerns are growing on the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, greenhouse effect, sea-level rise, acid rain, toxic waste, desertification and deforestation. Affixing blame is an inevitable fall-out. We must not, however, run the risk of being detracted from our goals to protect our planet. The point must not elude us that poverty and environmental degradation are inextricably linked. The proposed United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 should be able to draw up a blue-print for combined action, taking due note of the development aspects of the environmental problems. I wish to underscore the call of the Non-Aligned Summit based on the proposal of our President, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, in Belgrade, for an international convention on protection and conservation of global climate. We hope for follow-up action in this Assembly.
Today we are confronted with some social ills that have assumed gigantic proportions. Drugs have invaded our communities and homes, imperilling our societies, our national economies and even international peace and security. Terrorism and mindless violence strike at the very foundations of our society. We believe that only under the central management of the United Nations can we rally together for effective counteraction. This would mean an expanded role for the United Nations system, a role which has become both appropriate and relevant, and will, I am convinced, be performed with vigour and determination.
The Secretary-General has underscored the 'social mission' of the United Nations. All our efforts to achieve economic growth would be meaningless if social aspects of development were ignored. High rate of population growth, low literacy, lack of primary health care and safe drinking water, malnutrition, high infant mortality rate - all seriously affect the process of development and even have wider implications for the stability of international relations. Integrally linked with these issues is the need for improvements for vulnerable components of our societies - women, children, the aged and handicapped. In recent years, the United Nations has been the catalyst for international action in this area, and it should promote a global social strategy. In this context, we look forward to the adoption of the long-awaited United Nations convention on the rights of the child by this session of the Assembly. The proposed world summit on children is another commendable initiative that should receive the whole-hearted support of us all.
In the final analysis, all our efforts are directed towards improving intrinsic human worth. The contribution of the United Nations has been to draw up the rules that constitute human rights and give them authoritative definition. The task today is to translate them into reality. The dilemma is to keep pace with rising expectations along a broad and complex range of fronts. To many Member States like us, the right to development is inalienable and deserves topmost priority. It is unacceptable to us that, when over a billion people live on the bare margins of existence, any other right can take priority over the amelioration of their condition.
We must take full advantage of the potential of multilateral co-operation in order to assure a better future. The United Nations is the most universal focal point for such co-operation. To the founding fathers of this world body, the prevention of another global conflagration was the primary objective. Today, in a changed world situation, socio-economic under development poses an even greater threat to our societies. As the Secretary-General has said in his report this year, the progress we have achieved in the global political climate can prove precarious if the economic climate remains adverse for the majority of the world's population. Environmental degradation on a global scale is another related area of great concern to all of us. The focus of the United Nations in the coming decade should therefore appropriately be directed to these areas. We believe that any issue that affects humankind as a whole should receive priority attention by the Organization. That would not only make the United Nations more relevant and dynamic; through understanding and co-operation, this complex world would be a better place in which to live.
This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations. We are proud to be a part of this world forum. In reaffirming our total commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter, we are governed by the vision it conjures of a peaceful and secure world where people can pursue without hindrance or coercion the objective of a fulfilling and acceptable quality of life, consistent with human dignity in larger freedom. In his address at its fortieth anniversary session, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad very eloquently charted the role of the United Nations as being an organization in which 'the deepest aspirations of mankind can be fulfilled'.
","Today there is widespread belief that the United Nations has the unique potential and capacity, not only to adjust and accommodate, but also to fashion a concerted response to the multidimensional contemporary problems through a co-operative approach and management. Although richer nations were able to pull out of a serious economic recession to enjoy the longest period of economic expansion since the Second World War, the crisis in a vast majority of the developing countries has continued unabated. This also requires the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive set of measures that address all aspects of the problems that stifle the development of the developing countries. Bangladesh, to improve the global economic climate, would call for concerted and urgent action on the following points:
First, there must be a substantial increase in concessionary financial flows to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, and the flow of the world's surplus must be reversed to meet the need for investment in developing countries. Seventh, food security must be ensured, including emergency measures to expand food production in the least developed countries, ensuring adequate food reserves, access to food, and the creation of a nutrition, employment and health network for the most vulnerable groups."
44,1989,SWE,"ï»¿The recent successes of the United Nations towards the settlement of several regional conflicts have added new dimensions to the concept of collective responsibility and security. The general improvement in East-west relations paved the way for those positive developments. It is also clear that an important factor has been patient and quiet diplomacy under United Nations auspices. Yet we must be aware of the dangers of complacency. So long as war and conflict are still a reality in many parts of the world, the United Nations has an obligation to continue to press for peaceful solutions based on the principles of international law. Peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-building are the tools the United Nations uses in its task of serving peace: United Nations peace-keeping activities help conflicting parties avoid continued violence, united Nations peace-making efforts help conflicting parties reach lasting solutions. United Nations peace-building helps create conditions which may remove causes of war and conflict altogether.
The task of peace-building involves formidable challenges: we must take action to eradicate world poverty, we must tackle the debilitating debt problem, we must fight disease and rampant drug abuse, and we must rapidly reverse the trend of environmental destruction which fatally threatens our planet and the future of our children. Together with preventing nuclear war, that is the most pressing challenge. Catastrophe is closing in on us as we cross environmental thresholds which should never have been approached. Unless we now act collectively and decisively we shall all march into a poisoned wasteland. Europe, the classic focus of great-Power confrontation, has started to move towards political dialogue, arms reduction and peaceful co-operation. Today we dare to believe that the long period known as the cold war is now history and that a new period has begun, offering new opportunities for mankind.
The changes we are witnessing in the Soviet Union and in some other East European countries, particularly Poland and Hungary, are truly promising. This is what so many Europeans have been waiting for, for so many years. Following the elections in Poland a new coalition Government headed by Solidarity has taken office. This is a milestone in European postâWar history, These changes constitute a main element in the improvement of relations between the super-Powers and among European States. Also, the new Soviet attitude towards the United Nations has invigorated the world Organization.
The improved East-West climate has had important positive effects in removing much of the sharp edge of great-Power rivalry from regional conflicts. It is in this situation that the United Nations has proved as never before its value as an important for peace-making as well as for peace-keeping.
Peace-keeping and peace-making are closely interrelated. The number and value of United Nations peace-keeping activities have never been greater. The Nobel peace Prize for 1988 was awarded to the thousands of men and women who have valiantly served in United Nations peace-keeping operations since the 1950s.
In peace-making the United Nations has taken a decisive role in regions long torn by armed conflict, but also more and more in preventing conflicts from erupting into open warfare. The critical factor for the success of such efforts is a Security Council capable of reaching operative decisions. Also, when the Council gives directives to the Secretary-General they must be backed by continued political and material support.
a large and complex United Nations operation is currently under way in Namibia. Sweden fully supports the Security Council, the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General's Special Representative in their efforts to ensure the independence of Namibia through free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations. We greatly look forward to welcoming Namibia into the community of sovereign nations.
The system of apartheid is at the root of conflicts not only in south Africa but in the region as a whole. Apartheid is a threat to international peace and security, it is also an affront to human dignity. Apartheid must go, and it will go. Until then international pressure on South Africa must be increased. We shall continue to work for effective sanctions against South Africa. The special session of the General Assembly on apartheid must lead to further pressure on South Africa to enter into real negotiations. The comprehensive peace plan adopted by the Organization of African Unity should be supported by all of us. Now is the time for the South African Government to free Nelson Mandela and to recognize the true representatives of the majority of the people of South Africa.
The Middle East is one region where peace not only has to be made and kept, but has to be built up from the ground. The United Nations is involved in Peace-keeping through the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and in peace-making through the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council. Peace-building is being attempted by various United Nations agencies. Israel still defies the Palestinian people, its Arab neighbours, international law and world opinion by its continued occupation of Arab territories.
The intifadah has cleared away any remaining doubts about the will of the Palestinian people to shape their own future. The PLO wishes to negotiate with Israel. At last year's General Assembly, I appealed to the Israeli Government to take the hand extended by the PLO and to show a similar willingness to negotiate. Both the Palestinians and Israel must recognize each other's rights. Both sides must renounce terror. And both sides must be willing to talk to each other. Openness and dialogue is the enemy of mistrust and fear, as President Bush stated yesterday. Now is the time to start a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians. Through active and constructive efforts, in particular by Egypt, a crucial new step could now be taken on the road to a durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Negotiations through an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of all parties directly concerned, including the PLO, remain the best avenue ahead. The negotiations should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council and on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, full self-determination.
Sweden welcomes the cease-fire in Lebanon achieved through the efforts of the Arab League. All parties must now co-operate to reach a political solution. Withdrawal of foreign troops and an end to foreign interference is long overdue. The United Nations played a key peace-making role when the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan were negotiated through the good offices of the world Organization. The agreements raised hopes for a political settlement, hopes which have yet to materialize. It is deeply tragic that the agreements and the improved East-West climate have not meant the end of the war in Afghanistan. Attempts to reach a military solution, sustained by continued arms deliveries, will only result in  further suffering for the Afghan people. The Security Council now has to face up to its responsibilities and ensure a viable peace process. 
The Security Council has demonstrated its capacity for effective leadership in bringing the fighting between Iran and Iraq to an end. But its resolution 598 (1987) needs to be fully implemented in order to avoid a new flare-up of violence and to bring peace and stability to the area. Sweden strongly supports the Secretary-General and his personal representative in their efforts to achieve these results.
Sweden welcomes the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. The deep-seated internal conflict must not, however, be allowed to lead to even more bloodshed. The international community has a responsibility to ensure that the reign of terror does not return. The difficulties demonstrated at the Paris Conference must be overcome and no effort spared to reach a negotiated solution.
The gradually increasing role of the United Nations in Central America through its three innovative missions opens new possibilities for a successful peace process. I am confident that all States outside Central America, and in particular those with special ties to the region, will solidly support the regional peace process and the Secretary-General in his efforts.
All these activities, directly related to the maintenance of peace and security, are the collective responsibility of the Member States. This means that the assessments for peace-keeping, decided on by this Assembly, have to be paid by all Member States, in full and on time. The costs of keeping peace are indeed marginal to those of waging war. But making and keeping peace is not our only endeavour. Building peace goes beyond that. The roots of war and conflict are often to be found in unjust social and economic conditions. War and conflict always result in social and economic misery. War and conflict prevent the solution of social and economic problems. Social and economic conditions must be improved everywhere on a sound, sustainable basis.
A particularly pressing problem is the debt burden of the third world. Some progress has been made. But the third world debt still amounts to more than SUS 1,000 billion. This constitutes a destabilizing force not only in developing countries but also in the world economy.
Threats to the global environment are increasingly perceived to be no less serious than the threat of destruction by war. International co-operation to safeguard the environment and to promote sustainable developments in all countries must be central to the peace-building efforts of the United Nations.
Through the interaction of poverty and injustice with environmental stress, vast numbers of men, women and children have been forced to leave their degraded and destroyed home areas. Political instability, even international conflicts, could be the result as such migrations become more common and involve even greater numbers of environmental refugees. Concern for the environment must be integrated into our entire economic system in order to guarantee long-term survival and sustainable development. Therefore, the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development must lead to concrete action. With regard to the venue of the Conference, Sweden would find it most appropriate if this time it were held in a developing country. We welcome the consensus on Brazil's candidature reached at the summit meeting in Belgrade of the Non-Aligned Movement, it is vital that we now join together in laying the foundations for a truly successful Conference. Sweden intends to take an active part in the important preparatory process leading up to the Conference.
The struggle to safeguard our environment must be pursued at many different levels. Like other countries in northern Europe, Sweden is threatened by the pollution of the Baltic Sea. When Sweden assists Poland in its fight against  pollution, we do this also to secure our own environment. We would like to extend this co-operation to the entire Baltic Sea region. Even if the risk of nuclear war appears less imminent than for many decades. the vast arsenals of nuclear weapons by their very existence constitute a threat to life on our planet. The arms race increases the risk of war. The resources diverted from productive uses to military purposes are of staggering proportions. There is a growing realisation in the world that true peace and security cannot be based on deterrence and fear. The kind of security that depends on ever Increasing armaments must be replaced by a concept of common security that is basically political and rests on mutual confidence.
Promoting common security is a central element in the peace-building role of the united Nations. The negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament for a chemical weapons convention are complex, but I am convinced that they have now reached a stage where they can be successfully concluded if there is political .ill.
The super-Powers have a special responsibility with regard to disarmament in general and nuclear disarmament in particular. For example, the practice of the nuclear Powers neither to confirm nor deny the existence of nuclear weapons on board their warships is out of date and confidence-blocking. We hope, and expect, that their new and better understanding in the field of security will soon put an end to this practice.
Concern for human rights all over the world is very much a part of Peace-building. There is a wide discrepancy between the human rights standards subscribed to by Governments and the reality existing in many States. At the same time we are witnessing in many parts of the world the strength and vitality of popular faith in human rights and in democratic principles. This is true even when these rights and principles are violently suppressed, as they have sadly - not to use stronger words - have been in China and Burma this year. The United Nations provides a forum and machinery for holding Governments accountable to the international community for human rights violations. This platform must be used and extended.
The Commission on Human Rights has transmitted to the General Assembly two important draft instruments on human rights. The first is the convention on the rights of the child. It would constitute an important step towards improving the situation of children all over the world. The second is the optional protocol on the abolition of the death penalty. Sweden fully supports the adoption of these two instruments at this session of the General Assembly.
Peace-building through the United Nations involves a wide diversity of co-operative efforts. In one such area the challenges have recently been dramatically demonstrated in recent months and weeks. I am referring to the global problem of narcotic drugs, and in particular to the events in Colombia. These developments have demonstrated how closely the fight against narcotic drugs and terrorism is linked to peace and security. It is now high time for an international offensive against the scourge of narcotic drugs. An offensive can be made effective only through multilateral co-operation. Only the United Nations can provide suitable machinery for this urgent peace-building task. Sweden will propose at this session of the General Assembly the realization of a global programme of action against narcotic drugs.
To meet new demands the United Nations must of course have adequate resources. The financial crisis of the United Nations is perhaps less acute, but it is not over. Budget reform has had positive effects and must be pursued. It is not acceptable that certain Member States owe the Organization a total exceeding half a billion dollars. Financial obligations under the Charter must be fully honoured, and when new or increased demands are placed on the United Nations we must all be prepared to accept the costs. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and veteran United Nations diplomat Ralph Bunche once said, 'if we in the United Nations could be as successful at peace-making as we are at peace-keeping, then our problems would be greatly reduced'. Today we have reason to be more optimistic about the United Nations peace-making role than Ralph Bunche could be. 
The united Nations is the primary forum where together we can meet the challenges of the future, the challenges of peace-building. This makes tremendous demands on the world Organization, on its Member States and on our solidarity with each other. We all know that in a happy and harmonious family all members show solidarity with each other, in the same way justice and progress in a nation cannot be achieved without solidarity among the citizens. The same principle applies to the world. Peace-building demands solidarity among nations.
","Peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-building are the tools the United Nations uses in its task of serving peace: United Nations peace-keeping activities help conflicting parties avoid continued violence, united Nations peace-making efforts help conflicting parties reach lasting solutions. The task of peace-building involves formidable challenges: we must take action to eradicate world poverty, we must tackle the debilitating debt problem, we must fight disease and rampant drug abuse, and we must rapidly reverse the trend of environmental destruction which fatally threatens our planet and the future of our children. Through the interaction of poverty and injustice with environmental stress, vast numbers of men, women and children have been forced to leave their degraded and destroyed home areas. The kind of security that depends on ever Increasing armaments must be replaced by a concept of common security that is basically political and rests on mutual confidence. At the same time we are witnessing in many parts of the world the strength and vitality of popular faith in human rights and in democratic principles."
44,1989,TUR,"ï»¿
At the outset I extend my warm congratulations to the President on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This session is being held at a time when encouraging changes are taking place on the world scene. I am confident that under his guidance the session will contribute to the improvement of the international atmosphere by addressing the issues before it with courage, vision and realism.
I should also like to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, who carried out his duties with competence and wisdom.
Since it came into being 44 years ago the United Nations has embodied the hopes and aspirations of mankind for a peaceful and prosperous existence on this planet. Unfortunately, the years of the cold war and East-West tensions prevented the world body from properly addressing those universal aspirations.
We now appear to be entering a new phase in international relations, one that is characterized by a keener awareness on all sides that to achieve the objectives sought by the founders of the world body co-operation must replace confrontation, mutual confidence must replace historical suspicions and constructive dialogue must replace propaganda and invective. Those are the trends that have become
discernible on the international scene in recent years, and the resulting greater East-West co-operation has seen a blossoming of activities within the United Nations that are bound to make our world a better and more peaceful environment for all of us. The new international atmosphere has made it possible for the United Nations to tackle more purposefully the still-too-many sources of regional conflict. Important advances, even breakthroughs, have been achieved in that area.
The Organization is also tackling the very important economic-development issues of our day with new vigour and much greater realism. We are hopeful that the fourth United Nations development decade will reflect that new spirit and that creative and innovative solutions will be sought to alleviate the debt burden that weighs so heavily on so many Members of the Organization.
As the spirit of the new era asserts itself, we expect to see the Organization become more active in the important field of human rights. Human rights is one of those areas where the interests of all mankind converge, and it is natural that that universal concern should be reflected to a much greater extent in our debates.
We are confident that that trend will continue and that this session of the General Assembly will be an important milestone in our search for a better and safer world.
As the climate of East-West relations continues to improve, the momentum initiated by the United States and the Soviet Union towards the consolidation of that climate is universally welcomed. All countries, notwithstanding their size and policy orientation, have an indisputable stake in the furtherance and expansion of this propitious atmosphere. That is why we must all strive to make our contributions to the transformation of the political, economic, social and ecological environment. In this spirit Turkey will continue to make its contribution towards overcoming the Challenges facing mankind. This is a huge undertaking that can be tackled only in a gradual but progressively expanding manner. Guided by this philosophy, Turkey will continue to pursue actively a policy aimed at creating in its region relations based on mutual confidence that would help foster beneficial co-operation.
Times of change are times of opportunities. We are happy to note that these opportunities are being seized.
The successful conclusion of the follow-up to the Vienna Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) opened up the way for the negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe. Since the beginning of this new process of negotiations between the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven members of the Warsaw Pact, promising proposals have been put forward to establish a conventional balance at lower levels. This new and realistic approach to arms reduction negotiations, reflecting the constructive spirit that has begun to prevail in East-West relations in recent years, will have a positive effect on the future of multilateral arms control and disarmament efforts in general.
The implementation in good faith of the Helsinki Final Act and its concluding documents in all their aspects will decisively contribute to the attainment of an atmosphere of confidence and good will in Europe and thus to the smooth progress of the negotiations under way in Vienna.
The Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to take place in Geneva in August and September 1990, has already held its first and second sessions and completed an important part of its work in conformity with its mandate.
As a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Turkey holds the view that strict adherence to the Treaty is of vital significance. While the Treaty has so far performed its function, the need remains to strengthen further the non-proliferation regime. Similarly, increasing international co-operation in nuclear safety and the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be given firm and universal support.
We welcome the proposals made by President George Bush in his statement regarding the elimination of chemical weapons. We welcome also the positive Soviet response contained in Mr, Shevardnadze's statement. We consider this an auspicious step in the arms control process.
The convening of the Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in Paris in January 1989 and the unanimous adoption of a Final Declaration encompassing various aspects of this important problem constitute yet another major development. We hope that the Conference on Disarmament will move ahead faster to an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention that would globally ban the development; production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons under effective verification. Turkey does not have chemical weapons in stock nor does it aspire to possess any in the future.
After the entry into force and the ongoing implementation of the Inter mediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, it is with great interest that the hopes of the international community are pinned on the successful completion of the strategic arms reduction talks (START). A satisfactory START treaty would contribute significantly to the maintenance of the momentum of the arms control negotiations.
Turkey attaches importance to the success of the arms control and disarmament process as a whole, which it views as a comprehensive, integrated endeavour
encompassing nuclear as well as conventional aid chemical weapons, and confidence- and security-building measures.
We support all realistic initiatives in this field that hold the chance of being translated into concrete, balanced aid verifiable measures without diminishing the security of any country or group of countries.
Last year witnessed great achievements in the CSCE process. The crowing of efforts undertaken by the participating countries in producing a balanced document in Vienna constitutes yet another stepping-stone on this long and arduous path. By retaining the indispensable balance between all three baskets, the Vienna document has covered further ground, especially in the field of human rights, since security and confidence presuppose strict adherence to human rights and fundamental freedoms. In fact, without addressing the sanctity of the individual and his basic right to freedom, achieving security in the military sense will fail. We are heartened that today respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms has become a universal concern, a concern that transcends all boundaries. Today no country can evade its responsibilities in the field of human rights by hiding behind the shield of national sovereignty. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms has become the principal attribute of modern statehood.

In this connection I feel obliged to bring to this Assembly's attention a most serious issue that threatens to undermine the efforts to create an atmosphere of confidence, peace, stability and co-operation in Europe. It also affects the lives and well-being of 1.5 million people.
Bulgaria has been pursuing an inhuman assimilation and repression campaign against its Turkish minority since the end of 1984. Following the brutal and bloody repression oÂ£ the mass hunger strikes and peaceful demonstrations staged by ethnic Turks in May 1989, the Bulgarian authorities have resorted to the deportation of our kinsmen in large numbers. Bulgaria's policies have resulted in
a mass exodus to Turkey of more than 300,000 people, fleeing their homeland to escape oppression. This figure alone can give some idea of the intolerable dimensions of this colossal humanitarian problem. We believe that the sheer magnitude of this tragedy transcends the religious, ideological, political and cultural differences among nations. All nations should join in condemning the shameful policies that forced hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to emigrate to Turkey, leaving behind their lands, homes, possessions, social rights and, in some cases, even their sons of military age and other close relatives. We know that decant people everywhere share our indignation. No human being respectful of human rights and upholding the principles enshrined in the very foundations of the United Nations can be oblivious to this enormous human tragedy.
We are not seeking to undermine the sovereignty or the well being of Bulgaria. We do seek, however, a peaceful aid just solution to end the sufferings of our kinsmen whose rights and existence are safeguarded by various bilateral agreements and multilateral documents. We insist that Bulgaria honour its international obligations, including its commitments under the CSCE. In this regard, we have oily two objectives - aid they are peaceful aid humanitarian. First and foremost, we demand that the usurped human and minority rights of Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin be restored aid respected. Secondly, we wish to negotiate with Bulgaria with a view to concluding a comprehensive agreement on emigration to safeguard the rights aid family unity of those ethnic Turks who have already arrived in Turkey and to enable all those who my wish to emigrate to our country in the future to do so in an orderly manner aid without having to relinquish their social and property rights in Bulgaria.
To avoid any misunderstanding, let me stress here that our preference, of course, is not to see any more of our kinsmen uprooted from their homes. We would rather have them living in Bulgaria as loyal citizens of their country aid enjoying fully their human and minority rights. Let me reiterate, however, that Turkey is ready to receive, within the framework of a comprehensive emigration agreement, all the ethnic Turks in Bulgaria who may wish to leave that country.
Most regrettably, our repeated appeals to the Government of Bulgaria to enter into serious dialogue to bring about a satisfactory solution to this humanitarian problem have so far yielded no results owing to Bulgaria's intransigent attitude and its refusal to acknowledge the very existence of the problem. That is a clear indication that Bulgaria's real purpose is not to facilitate the emigration of ethnic Turks to -Turkey but to eliminate the problem by evicting these people from the country, to allow emigration only under its own specific terms aid to assimilate the remaining Turks in due course.
Turkey has therefore decided to revert to the existing visa regime between the two countries by putting an end to the exceptional practice, in use since the beginning of June 1989, of allowing Bulgarian citizens to enter Turkey without a visa. This unfortunate minority question is not simply a bilateral problem between Turkey and Bulgaria, but is an issue of principle between Bulgaria and the entire community of nations. That is why a large number of countries have voiced their objections to Bulgaria's unacceptable policies and urged it to heed reason. That is why international bodies, including the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, have adopted unambiguous resolutions to the same effect. That is why the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of the Islamic Conference will hold an extraordinary meeting here in New York tomorrow on the tragedy of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria.
I should like to use this occasion to call upon my colleagues assent led here today to redouble their efforts to persuade Bulgaria to alter its anachronistic Practices. The Government of Bulgaria must be assisted - and effectively - to realize that to abandon those policies would not be a sign of weakness but a virtue. And Bulgaria knows full well that should it display the courage and wisdom not to persist in its untenable stand, Turkey, mindful of the once mutually beneficial relations of good-neighbourliness and cooperation between the two countries, will not hesitate to take reciprocal steps conducive to the normalization of Turkish-Bulgarian relations.
 I listened attentively to the statement made this morning by the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria. Mr. Mladenov referred, as we do, to dialogue as the best means for the mutually desired normalization of Turkish-Bulgarian relations. He neglected, however, to acknowledge that the tragedy imposed on ethnic -Barks in Bulgaria was and remains the only reason for the present tension. He also forgot to note that the implementation of the Belgrade Protocol to which he referred was inconclusive owing to the refusal of the Bulgarian side to discuss this humanitarian issue. Therefore, I must say - and with regret - that his statement today contained no new elements, despite the optimistic note he attempted to strike. But, of course, if through that statement the Bulgarian side implies that it is ready and willing to enter into a dialogue with us with a view to putting an end to the plight of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria in all its aspects, we would, as I stressed earlier, not hesitate to reciprocate. But, clearly, we cannot build castles of hope on vague positions; we cannot invest hope in calls for dialogue in a vacuum. Turkey, therefore, will wait for Bulgaria to demonstrate through concrete and significant steps its will aid commitment to contribute to the solution of the problem it has created. We shall wait for the Bulgarian Government to declare unambiguously its readiness also to discuss this particular issue in the negotiations the entire community of nations has been calling for. Otherwise, the positive mood the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria tried to create in this Hall will wither away before long.
By virtue of Turkey's geographical location and its historical ties, the Middle East and the fate of the people of that region are of particular interest for us. We have been following with concern the increasing tensions in the area. Turkey has on several occasions expressed, from this rostrum, its firm stand on the question of Palestine, which constitutes the crux of the Middle East conflict.
After more than two decades of occupation, the West Bank and Gaza have erupted into open rebellion. The frustration of the Palestinians is not a matter that can be dealt with by the use of force. The death toll aid the level of violence are bound to increase so long as the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians are suppressed. Since December 1987 events have demonstrated that the Palestinians will not be intimidated by violence and that the intifadah will not peter out. We are appealing once again for the end of harsh repressive measures.
The Palestine Liberation Organization has taken important steps to break the present deadlock by adopting policies which have been recognized as realistic and constructive. Israel should reciprocate those moves by adopting more conciliatory policies. Israel should also consider with self-confidence and vision the ideas that have been put forward in the hope of contributing to the initiation of a promising phase in the peace process.
Turkey is convinced that there can be no satisfactory long-term solution to this serious problem that is not based on negotiations with the participation of all the interested parties, conducted in good faith within the framework of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East.
Another source of concern for my Government is the tragic situation in Lebanon. We welcome the sustained efforts of Saudi Arabia, Algeria aid Morocco aimed at achieving national reconciliation in that country, Turkey believes that in bringing the state of anarchy in that coin try to an aid a framework mist be found that will ensure Lebanon's unity, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, aid the removal of all foreign troops.
A subject that arouses anxiety in Turkey is the tragedy of the hostages in Lebanon. The early release and safe return home of all hostages is the common wish of the international community.
We welcome all peace initiatives relating to the Iran-Iraq conflict. Special tribute should be paid to the dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative on the complicated issues relating to the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We hope that these mediation efforts will create the necessary atmosphere of mutual trust favourable to the full and rapid implementation of that resolution. The present situation is unsatisfactory aid precarious, and it should not be allowed to continue.
As a country that maintains friendly relations with both parties, we reaffirm our readiness to contribute in any way we can to the progress of the peace process and the promotion of a climate of confidence.
The tragic situation in Afghanistan continues to be a source of particular concern aid distress for Turkey. The conclusion of the Geneva Agreements constituted an important step towards the political solution of the Afghanistan problem. Through those Agreements we have seen the withdrawal of foreign troops. Now, the need for a broad-based Government, fully representative of the Afghan people, stands out as an essential element for a lasting solution of this problem. At present, Pakistan continues to bear the brunt of the burden of providing shelter for the Afghan refugees who have been driven by war from their homes. Pakistan's generosity has rightly earned it the gratitude of the international community.
The signing, in New York last December, of the agreements among Angola, Cuba aid South Africa aimed at achieving peace in southern Africa aid the independence of Namibia within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has been
a source of deep satisfaction for Turkey. We are looking forward to the day when we welcome Namibia in our midst as an independent, democratic State. As one of the founding members of the United Nations Council for Namibia, Turkey is profoundly satisfied by these developments. It is imperative, however, that the remaining obstacles to the effective and full implementation or the United Nations plan for Namibia be completely removed.
In neighbouring South Africa, the apartheid system is a blatant violation of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In spite of the many resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council condemning that abominable system. South Africa has chosen stubbornly to ignore the universal revulsion, and has so far refused to make a radical change in its racial policies. The complete elimination of apartheid is the only acceptable solution, and will continue to be our common goal.
The positive developments concerning the situation in Cambodia in the last few months give us hope that an end to the suffering of that beleaguered nation might be in the offing. Turkey appreciates the diplomatic activities, especially those of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, aimed at achieving this objective, and pays tribute to the efforts of the States that participated in the international conference on Cambodia.
In eastern Asia, the division of the Korean peninsula continues to be a source of unease for the international community. We attach importance to and support the initiatives undertaken by the Republic of Korea aimed at a meaningful dialogue with its neighbour. The peaceful solution of the questions between the two sides through dialogue based on mutual accommodation will, I am confident, lead to their eventual representation as full Members of our Organization.
International co-operation against drugs is a must. The new Convention against illicit trafficking is a major step in the right direction. It will make new demands on the United Nations bodies involved, which are already spread thin. The allocation in the regular budget of greater resources to the International narcotics Control Board secretariat and to the Division of narcotic Drugs is indispensable, for more effective use of United Nations expertise on drugs, contributions to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control should be increased. Multilateral co-operation against illicit trafficking can offer the best challenge against the scourge. My country is a good example of the results that can be achieved in this area.
International terrorism continues to be a global problem and a major source of tension in international relations. Turkey has always condemned as criminal all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of their origins, causes or purposes. We believe that terrorism cannot be justified under any circumstances. In this context I would observe that attempts to differentiate between various forms of terrorism will only encourage the terrorists. Experience has amply demonstrated that tolerance and support of terrorism is a double-edged sword, and that those who have followed that path have always had reasons to regret their short-sighted policy.
Last year the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides embarked upon a new negotiating process. We welcomed that development. We had hoped that this latest set of negotiations would pave the way to a lasting settlement in Cyprus and lead to the establishment of a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation based on the political equality of the two peoples on the island.
It will be recalled that, prior to this latest phase in the talks, the Greek Cypriots had rejected the framework agreement of 29 March 1986 Which the Turkish Cypriote had accepted, m doing so, the Greek Cypriots added yet another notch to their long list of missed and wasted opportunities for conciliation in the island. This new round of negotiations represents, in a sense, a last chance for an honourable settlement, because Turkish Cypriot patience is beginning to reach its limits in the face of constant Greek Cypriot intransigence. Looking back, it is difficult to say that the Greek Cypriots even came close to making wise use of this latest opportunity. They failed to negotiate constructively, and from the outset they preferred the intervention of third parties so as to have them exert pressure on the Turkish Cypriots. Once the Greek Cypriots opted for such a fundamentally erroneous and counterproductive approach, they felt no need to respond, even halfway, to comprehensive Turkish Cypriot proposals that had been presented formally and in writing in the course of the negotiations.
The Greek Cypriot side has in the mean time engaged in new acts of violence in Cyprus and has committed transgressions against Turkish Cypriot territory. It has also pursued a programme of intensive rearmament. Purchases of weapons and military equipment that are under way have reached alarming proportions. All of these Greek Cypriot actions spoil the atmosphere and deepen the mistrust in the island.
The Turkish Cypriot people have been compelled to react to this situation through a resolution adopted in their parliament. Despite all the provocations, the resolution kept the door open to direct negotiations without any preconditions. It is yet to be seen whether the Greek Cypriots will return to the path of fair and honest talks. It is also yet to be seen whether they can take a step forward by pledging respect for the existence of the Turkish Cypriots as one of the two distinct and politically equal peoples of the island. We attach paramount importance to this point, because only then, without the burden of hostile practices, will the negotiating process have a reasonable chance of success.
Last week, the Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece made extensive comments on Cyprus in his statement to the General Assembly. I regret to say that the mentality and the attitude displayed in that statement cast a dark shadow over the efforts for a negotiated settlement in Cyprus. We have seen in his statement a very unfortunate approach designed to misrepresent the facts on Cyprus with a view to misleading the international community.
There is much to be said concerning the grave responsibility of Greece with regard to the emergence and the perpetuation of the Cyprus question. It is Greece and the Greek Cypriots who were fully responsible for the destruction of the bi-communal partnership republic in Cyprus in 1963 through the use of force. Greece and the Greek Cypriots have been responsible for keeping Cyprus in a constant state of crisis for 11 years and for keeping the Turkish Cypriots virtual hostages in their own lad prior to 1974. Greece and Greek Cypriots are responsible for the coup of 15 July 1974 in which they tried to deal a final blow to the independence of the island and to the Turkish Cypriots' existence there. Turkey can take credit for bringing this unacceptable state of affairs to an end and for providing security for the Turkish Cypriots.
I would have preferred not to be placed in the position of having to recall the dark role played by Greece at critical stages in the recent history of Cyprus. I am deeply disturbed to see that Greece is once again on a similarly harmful course at another critical juncture in Cyprus. With the utmost regret aid reluctance, I feel compelled to bring this situation to the attention of the Assembly on this occasion. We have also brought this to the attention of the Secretary-General.
Today the world economic prospects for growth and trade call for more optimism than before. A rapid rate of growth in the industrialized countries has been associated with the expansion of employment, the relative reduction of external imbalances, the meaningful progress in some structural reforms, aid the acceleration of both export and import volumes.
As far as developing countries are concerned, the economic environment has also improved considerably in some of them as a result of policy reforms and world trade expansion. However, many of those countries have not derived their fair share from revived economic growth and they continue to face major problems, including high inflation rates, heavy debt burdens, structural adjustment challenges and population pressures. A number of challenges are also faced by industrialized countries on the path of continuing stable expansion.
All those problems, risks and uncertainties call for improved international co-operation in an increasingly interdependent world. Only thus, we believe, can the challenges we face together be met successfully for the benefit of humankind as a whole. In concluding, I wish to renew our hope that this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and will contribute to the security and well-being of all nations.
","By retaining the indispensable balance between all three baskets, the Vienna document has covered further ground, especially in the field of human rights, since security and confidence presuppose strict adherence to human rights and fundamental freedoms. All nations should join in condemning the shameful policies that forced hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to emigrate to Turkey, leaving behind their lands, homes, possessions, social rights and, in some cases, even their sons of military age and other close relatives. Secondly, we wish to negotiate with Bulgaria with a view to concluding a comprehensive agreement on emigration to safeguard the rights aid family unity of those ethnic Turks who have already arrived in Turkey and to enable all those who my wish to emigrate to our country in the future to do so in an orderly manner aid without having to relinquish their social and property rights in Bulgaria. Most regrettably, our repeated appeals to the Government of Bulgaria to enter into serious dialogue to bring about a satisfactory solution to this humanitarian problem have so far yielded no results owing to Bulgaria's intransigent attitude and its refusal to acknowledge the very existence of the problem. We welcome the sustained efforts of Saudi Arabia, Algeria aid Morocco aimed at achieving national reconciliation in that country, Turkey believes that in bringing the state of anarchy in that coin try to an aid a framework mist be found that will ensure Lebanon's unity, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, aid the removal of all foreign troops."

First of all, on behalf of the Chad delegation, which I have the honour of heading, I should like to convey to Mr. Joseph Garba our most earnest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. As Chad has a common border and so many historical bonds with Nigeria - his great country â it can only express satisfaction that he is directing our work. His election  which does honour to all of Africa, is a tribute to his talents as a diplomat and an experienced statesman. He may be assured of the full co-operation of ray delegation in carrying out his difficult responsibilities.
I should like also to express to Mr, Dante Caputo, the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, the gratitude of ray delegation for his excellent work as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. The Chad delegation would like, once again, to pay a well-deserved tribute to the dynamic Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose dedication to the cause of peace and development deserves the admiration of all. In his report on the activities of the Organization, the Secretary-General notes that there is increased co-operation between the permanent members of the Security Council in the quest for solutions to international conflicts and, above all, that the two major blocs have undertaken a quest for lasting peace. This trend in international relations, which are now based more on trust, should be encouraged.
Indeed, the Second World War, the fiftieth anniversary of whose beginning we are marking this year, is an appropriate reminder of the painful circumstances that led to the founding of the United Nations. This reminder of history should, above all, compel us to work in solidarity to strengthen the San Francisco Charter. The solemn commitment to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, is still coming up against difficulties, even though the atmosphere today would seem to be mote than ever propitious for universal peace. The Government of the Republic of Chad, for its part, has always worked for peace in international relations and in its own relations with neighbouring countries.
In this connection, the process begun last year in the context of the Chad-Libya conflict, with the assistance of friendly countries, continued. That process represented a step forward in the improvement of relations between the two States. Thanks to the persevering activities of the President of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Moussa Traore, President of the Republic of Mali, of the President of the Republic of Gabon and Mr. Al-Hadj Omar Bongo, and of the President of the Ad HÐ¾Ñ Committee of the OAU on the Chad-Libya dispute, Mt. Chedli Bendjedid, President of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria, Chad and Libya signed, in Algiers on 31 August 1989, a framework agreement on the settlement of their dispute. Years of deadly confrontation between two countries fated by history and geography to live together in peace have given rise to substantial human and material loss. That situation, which forced Chad to devote its meagre resources to purposes of defence, considerably delayed our country's reconstruction and development.
Having always held that Chad and Libya have better things to do than make war, the Chadian Government promptly demonstrated its approval of the Algiers Agreement by proceeding, as early as 1 September 1989, to release a group of Libyan prisoners of war. We hope that this significant gesture, which reflects Chad's goodwill towards the brotherly Libyan people and its respect for the pledge it made, will open the way to the final settlement of a conflict pitting two brotherly States against each other in the Chadian region of Aozou.
By envisaging conciliation as an initial stage, the Agreement appeals to the two parties to show the political determination to establish lasting peace between them. Only if this machinery does not yield the desired result within a year will the International Court of Justice be seized of the territorial dispute.
Additional measures are provided for as part of the implementation of the Agreement, including the withdrawal of the forces of the two countries from positions they occupied as of 25 August 1989 in the disputed region  this withdrawal is to take place under the supervision of an African observer commission, and there is to be a ban on any new settlements, in whatever form, in the region.
Reiterating their decision concerning the cease-fire that took effect on 11 September 1987, Chad and Libya also undertook to end any hostility, especially all hostile media campaigns to refrain from direct or Indirect Interference, In any form, under any pretext and in any circumstances, in the internal and external affairs of their respective countriesâ to ban any political, material, financial or military support to any forces hostile to either of the two countries; and to proceed to the signing of a treaty of friendship, good-neighbourliness and economic and financial co-operation between the two countries,
A joint committee will be established to lay down the provisions for the implementation of the Agreement and to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to that effect. The Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity on the Chad-Libyan dispute is to follow up the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement.
Those are the salient points of the Agreement, which ushers in a new era in relations between Chad and Libya. But need I point out that the strength of any agreement lies in the political will of those who implement it? Thus, the full, practical implementation of the Algiers Agreement will be the measure of the scope and value of the commitments entered into. For its part, Chad has already communicated this important Agreement to the Secretariat of the United Nations, in accordance with article 7 of the Agreement.
From this rostrum, my delegation expresses the sincere gratitude of the Government and people of Chad to all the illustrious Heads of State who have made such a positive contribution to the ushering in of this new era - which we hope will be a felicitous One - in the relations between Chad and Libya. As we have always maintained, this Agreement bears witness to Chad's constant desire to live in peace with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, strictly respecting its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and basic rights. That is our creed, and our commitment to peace is unequivocal. 
As they resolutely face the future the Chadian people, at peace with themselves and united in their great movement - the National Onion for Independence and Revolution - aspire to a better standard of living. In this regard, the second Congress of the Union, held in N'Djamena in November 1988, adopted major decisions, which the Government is now implementing.
In political terms, the draft of a new Constitution, submitted by the Constitutional Committee several months ago, will be put to the Chadian people in 1990 for adoption. The aim of that referendum to be held in 1990 is thus approval of the new constitutional law, and thereby the consolidation of the process of normalization of national life and the establishment of political stability by providing the country with adequate and viable institutions taking into account the far-reaching aspirations of our people and the political, social and economic realities of our country.
In economic terms, although - as in fact the Secretary-General points out in his report on the programme of special economic assistance to Chad -
,A favourable pattern of rainfall in Chad in 1987/88 resulted in a striking recovery in agricultural output in 1988/89 from the depressed 1987 levels (A/44/418, para, Î²), the country remains subject to the vagaries of nature. In that connection, the floods in August last year once again defeated Chad's efforts to achieve food self-sufficiency. Efforts are still under way to that end. Henceforth the emphasis will be placed on the development of off-season irrigated crops in order to cope with the country's erratic rainfall patterns. The fact that 700,000 tons of grain were produced last year gives us reason to hope that the better use of new crop technologies will indeed help Chad to achieve food self-sufficiency.
Nevertheless, the country remains dominated by one crop t cotton. The price for this commodity is set by stock-market speculators and is completely beyond the control of the State. In spite of the efforts made sacrifices made, and a slight improvement in cotton prices, this sector still shows a deficit. In those circumstances, while it continues to put into effect measures to improve the whole process in this respect, the Chadian Government is forced to seek condensation elsewhere foe losses in revenue resulting from the elimination of export taxes on cotton fibre. Aware of the disastrous effects the instability in the prices of agricultural commodities could have, the Chadian Government is determined to make cattle-raising the true second staple of the country. In this regard, a large national livestock programme is now being implemented. Its objective is to maximize the capacity of the livestock sector in order to counterbalance the disadvantages of the cultivation of cotton as our sole crop. Development of cattle-raising not only will bring more income to the people of Chad but also will lead to an increase in trade between Chad and its neighbours and other countries of Central Africa. 
As can be seen, the economic and financial situation of Chad remains a difficult one, and is quite precarious despite the radical measures taken by the Government and the sacrifices made by the people of Chad. In its efforts to improve the living conditions of its people the Government is giving priority to self-sufficiency in food as well as to education and health, by closely involving the population in implementation programmes.
In these circumstances external financial assistance will for many years to come continue to play an essential role in the implementation of economic and social programmes in Chad. With that in mind, the Government of Chad intends to organize, in 1990, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme, two round-table conferences: one on education and the development of human resources, and the other on public health and the family - population questions. During those two meetings the Government of the Republic of Chad will submit to friendly countries and international bodies programmes to finance sectors vital to the development of our country.
Furthermore, pursuant to resolution 43/205, my Government intends in 1990 to submit to donors and creditors a four-year plan now being developed in co-operation with the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank. We sincerely hope that, like the Geneva conferences of 1982 and 1985 on international assistance to Chad, and the meetings and round-table conferences on the recovery of the Borkou-Ehnedi-Tibesti region held in previous years, the international community will give massive assistance in response to our appeal, which proposes financing for each sector as well as the priority development projects of the four-year plan. While relying on its own efforts for reconstruction and the beginning of true agricultural development, Chad is grateful to the friendly countries and international organizations which, since the restoration of State authority, have constantly supported us through diverse and appropriate forms of assistance.
With the continued return of refugees, assistance from the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees remains necessary to and their resettlement. Similarly many parts of the border region are still inaccessible because of the mines land during the occupation, which prevents the return of displaced persons to their area of origin. Here again we count on the international community to help us - on the one hand, to make the area habitable and, on the other, to provide the necessary minimum assistance to displaced persons.
Taking into account the overall economic and social situation of Chad, whose special characteristics should be borne in mind, my delegation will once again this year submit two draft resolutions: one to the Second Committee, for special economic assistance, and the other to the Third Committee, for emergency humanitarian assistance. We hope that those draft resolutions will be supported by all delegations at the current session.
The encouraging results seen in Chad through its efforts at reconstruction and economic recovery would not have been possible without the constant and substantial support of friendly countries. Chad extends its gratitude to them. It also thanks governmental and non-governmental organizations for the substantial support they have given in this immense effort at Rational reconstruction. The activities of the united Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as the co-ordinating agency for the operational activities of the United Nations, must be emphasized and welcomed.
While the major objective of the United Nations Is to ensure peace and security, we should recall that economic and social development Is essential to achievement of that objective, unfortunately we are obliged to observe that the current International economic system Is characterized by increased imbalances and inequalities, with grave consequences for the stability of the developing countries. As the Secretary-General emphasized at the 1989 second regular session of the Economic and Social Council when he said ,We ate deeply concerned to see the large number of countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia that are prisoners of poverty and to report that their efforts are failing because of an unfavourable international climate and a deterioration in their internal problems,.
That clear-sighted analysis should compel the international community to make efforts to find bolder solutions. In this regard the delegation of Chad commends the proposals of the French and American Presidents, Francois Mitterand and George Bush, to cancel pact of the loans their countries have given to Africa in the form of public assistance for development. Those welcome decisions, which recognize that to be viable any solution to the problem of the indebtedness of the African countries must involve a reduction in debt, deserve our support and should be followed by all the industrialized countries.
Furthermore, the growing marginalization of the African economies, which continues to be caused by a deterioration in the terms of trade, requires immediate international attention. In this connection the international community should play an active role in seeking the reform of raw materials markets. In particular steps should be taken to enhance the effectiveness of the common fund for commodities so that speculators might be forced to charge fairer prices more in keeping with the efforts made by producer countries. Indeed, structural reforms in the economies of third world countries cannot allow real development unless they are supported by appropriate export earnings.
For now the situation in the third world countries is tragic and characterized by zero growth, a reduced standard of living and a high rate of inflation. Ironically, in current economic relations, the net transfer of capital from the South to the North from 1982 to 1988 was approximately S300 billion, whereas the capital flow to the developing countries declined considerably. This negative trend should be corrected. The convening in 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly Ñ international economic co-operation, in particular on renewed growth in the economies and the development of developing countries, will provide an opportunity for the taking of appropriate measures. Chad fully supports the fourth international development strategy, which should be broadly based on past experience to foster sustained economic growth for the developing countries.
,today the environment is gaining increased attention from the international community because of a better understanding of its broad implications. The convening of an international conference on the environment and development in 1992 will be a major step forward in the process under way to ensure better protection.
Certain kinds of environmental problems are being experienced daily by the peoples of the Sahel. Indeed, drought and desertification continue to be of major concern to the Governments members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CIIiSS). Indeed, the shrinkage of ground cover, the decrease in surface water, the reduction in fishing resources, the drop in water tables and the drying up of wells have sorely tried the economies of those countries. The situation has been aggravated by the debt burden and the fall in prices of agricultural raw materials, making the result of these efforts uncertain. On the occasion of CILSS Day, 12 September 1989, His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre, current Chairman of the Committee, stated. The challenge of the Sahel continues to confront us, but our first victory is the one we must win over ourselves.,
The joint strategies adopted by the States members of CILSS will no doubt enable us batter to meet that challenge, but the results obtained thus far remain meagre when compared to the scope of the problem. Thus the States members of CILSS ate once again appealing to the international community to lend its support within the framework of a plan of action to contain desertification.
Experience in recent years has shown that, when united. States can cope effectively with major challenges, whether they be natural disasters or such evils as drugs, ANDS and terrorism. W.'-h regard to terrorism, one of the most recent incidents has been the airline disaster of 19 September 1989, which cost the lives of 171 innocent persons, including 40 Chadians, among them the Minister of Planning and Co-operation His Excellency Mahamat Soumaila. My delegation vigorously condemns the wantonness, cruelty and inhumanity of terrorism. Chad not only condemns the abhorrent act but will combat terrorism from whatever quarter it comes and whatever form it may take. All States must therefore actively participate in wiping out these plagues threatening all of the international community by making full use of the irreplaceable instrumentation of the United Nations.
Today we note with satisfaction the praiseworthy efforts being made to initiate a dynamic of peace and put an end to the hotbeds of tension and war by which many areas of the globe are sorely tried.
In that connection the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia is clearly a decisive step towards the realisation of the goal the Organization has set itself. However, acts of intimidation and South Africa's deliberate attempts to sabotage that territory's peaceful accession to international sovereignty are direct threats to peace and stability in that long-troubled region. Chad therefore calls upon the Security Council to exert all its influence to ensure respect for resolutions 435 (1978), 632 (1989) and 640 (1989).
Subtle oppression and violence continue to prevail in South Africa, where apartheid still reigns as the supreme form of colonialism. In that connection His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre, President of the Republic of Chad, recently stated 	.
The entire world condemns that system, which is the total negation of the rights of peoples and of human rights, but it continues to exist and to hold sway. Indeed, everyone condemns apartheid, but not everyone fights for its disappearance, especially those with the withdraw to succeed.,
In order to improve the current international political climate, the Government of South Africa should not just make timid advances to the majority, but instead, finally put an end to its outmoded practice and inaugurate a true democracy based on the principle of one man, one votes in an equal and multiracial society.
In Angola, where a positive process has begun, Chad encourages dialogue leading to a final reconciliation among Angolans.
With regard to Western Sahara, Chad welcomes the initiatives under way and firmly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
The hope created by the signature of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan has not yet been realized. Chad appeals to the political will of the Afghan leaders to spate their people further suffering. Similarly, the world's attention has been focused on the Paris Conference, which offered a historic opportunity to put an end to the long conflict and the sufferings of the Kampuchean people. In spite of the meagre results obtained, owing to the complexity of the situation, there are grounds for hope that the sense of responsibility and interest of the Kampuchean people will prevail during future meetings and that the withdrawal of foreign troops will be accomplished.
The situation in the Middle East, at the core of which is , the tragic Palestinian problem, demands our attention. Twenty-two months after the beginning of the intifadah the Palestinian people have shown their goodwill by agreeing to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Chad, which has always supported the struggle of the Palestinian people for the exercise of their inalienable rights and which recognized the Palestinian State upon its proclamation at Algiers, supports the idea of the convening of an international conference bringing together all the parties concerned, together with the permanent members of the Security Council, as the best means of achieving a comprehensive solution to the problem. 
With regard to Lebanon Chad deplores the violence in that part of the world. We appeal urgently to all parties to exercise restraint and we call upon foreign forces to cease their interference. The independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon should be respected, in keeping with Security Council resolution 639 (1989).
By its tireless efforts the international community has contributed to putting an end to the bloody, murderous conflict between Iran and Iraq. Not all the pending issues have yet been settled and there is still cause for concern. For this reason, Chad urges both countries to engage resolutely in the search for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace through compliance with and full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and supports the role of the Secretary-General to that end.
Similarly, Chad encourages any initiative that would obviate any further delay in the processes under way on the Korean peninsula, in Cyprus and in Central America.  
This brief overview of the international political situation, which has been marked by conflicts and tensions, should encourage us to make better use of the existing machinery in order to establish peace the world over. The fundamental given fact of our time is peaceful coexistence, which, if violated, inevitably jeopardizes international peace and security. These are still, unfortunately, based on doubtful realities such as the balance of terror and the principle of might makes right. Nevertheless, it is comforting to note the increasing awareness, on the part of nations the world over, of the imperative need to change this state of affairs.
In this regard, Chad commends the progress achieved by the super-Powers towards disarmament, which reflects a determination and a sense of responsibility that take into account the concerns of mankind. These basic concerns are, first and foremost, international peace and security, which depend on general and complete disarmament, respect for the principles of international law governing relations among States, and equitable international economic relations whereby all countries, producers and consumers of commodities, will act in such a way that they feel that they are complementary because ,one of the most precious human rights is that of receiving just remuneration for one's work.
The best possible living conditions for all peoples the world over - that is in fact the goal which all of mankind should pursue in good faith and in all honesty. I would conclude here with a quotation from the President and Head of State of the Government of Chad, His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre:
Peace and security, we cannot repeat it enough, have a direct effect on the lives of peoples 
My delegation believes that the States Members of the United Nations should act with this in view in order to achieve the basic objectives of a more just world, one in which nations would live on good terms with each other and where peoples, freed from the shackles of squalor and poverty, would exist together in perfect harmony, with understanding, with love for each other, in a word, in universal peace.
","In his report on the activities of the Organization, the Secretary-General notes that there is increased co-operation between the permanent members of the Security Council in the quest for solutions to international conflicts and, above all, that the two major blocs have undertaken a quest for lasting peace. We hope that this significant gesture, which reflects Chad's goodwill towards the brotherly Libyan people and its respect for the pledge it made, will open the way to the final settlement of a conflict pitting two brotherly States against each other in the Chadian region of Aozou. Taking into account the overall economic and social situation of Chad, whose special characteristics should be borne in mind, my delegation will once again this year submit two draft resolutions: one to the Second Committee, for special economic assistance, and the other to the Third Committee, for emergency humanitarian assistance. Chad, which has always supported the struggle of the Palestinian people for the exercise of their inalienable rights and which recognized the Palestinian State upon its proclamation at Algiers, supports the idea of the convening of an international conference bringing together all the parties concerned, together with the permanent members of the Security Council, as the best means of achieving a comprehensive solution to the problem. I would conclude here with a quotation from the President and Head of State of the Government of Chad, His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre:
Peace and security, we cannot repeat it enough, have a direct effect on the lives of peoples 
My delegation believes that the States Members of the United Nations should act with this in view in order to achieve the basic objectives of a more just world, one in which nations would live on good terms with each other and where peoples, freed from the shackles of squalor and poverty, would exist together in perfect harmony, with understanding, with love for each other, in a word, in universal peace."
44,1989,SYR,"ï»¿Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, particularly, as your country, Nigeria, and mine, Syria, enjoy long-standing relations of friendship, and both are members of the Non-Aligned Countries, in which our two countries are united in the common struggle against colonialism and all forms of racism.
I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the success achieved by your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, in guiding the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish his country, Argentina, progress and prosperity in the future.
It is natural for feelings of optimism to prevail in most of the statements delivered so far in this historic forum as a reflection of the improvement in the international climate, and of the move the world has taken, following years of confrontation, tension aid cold war, to a new phase of detente, dialogue and co-operation.
There is no doubt that this change in the climate of international relations would not have taken place without the significant Soviet-United States dialogue and the agreements and initiatives that dialogue has led to in the field of disarmament, particularly with regard to nuclear aid chemical weapons. These are indeed important steps on a long road, and the peoples of the world hope that this will not be a dead-end road. The gravest danger is essentially the actual presence of weapons of mass destruction, not merely their numbers. The maintenance of any arsenals of these destructive weapons, however limited, will always be a terrifying nightmare for humanity as a whole.
The peoples of the world further expect that this process will not be selective and limited only to one type of weapons of mass destruction, because no one can claim that there are clean weapons of mass destruction aid dirty weapons of mass destruction. All nuclear and chemical weapons are undoubtedly both destructive and dirty. Indeed, those weapons had been used by man against man in the past, causing incalculable suffering. What then would be the consequences of the use of such weapons of mass destruction in the future, with their more sophisticated developments?
Proceeding from our firm conviction that all States of the world should participate in the process of eliminating and prohibiting all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, the Syrian Arab Republic calls for the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or biological, in the Middle East region. We believe that the United Nations provides the appropriate framework for the achievement of such an objective.
Although some years have elapsed since the beginning of the improvement in the atmosphere of international relations, a development which has had a positive effect on regional disputes throughout the world, the Arab-Israeli conflict is continuing to take a different course. It is a conflict developing in an atmosphere of tension and confrontation. The reason is clear and does not require lengthy explanation. The rulers of Israel, with their Zionist doctrine, which is unmatched in fanaticism and fundamentalism, continue to live in another age, although they possess the most advanced means, the latest equipment, particularly in the field of armaments.
Those rulers continue to rely on myths and illusions to justify the realization of their final objective of establishing the greater Israel from the
Nile to the Euphrates. This is an objective which they do not, and, indeed, cannot conceal. We all recall how furious the Israeli rulers were with their American friends when they advised them to renounce their dream of a Greater Israel.
When they fail to convince their closest allies of their false claims, the rulers of Israel resort - as Moshe Arens did in his statement to the General Assembly last week - to documents and promises that go back to colonial times, to records kept in the archives of the League of Nations to justify their continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. At the same time they flagrantly ignore the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the United Nations which call upon Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and call for the recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Arab Palestinian people.
The problem facing the peace process in the Middle East is not merely the dilemma of the dreams of Israel, it is a problem of Israeli practices also. The rulers of Israel keep on reminding the world every day of the Nazi crimes against the Jews, although those crimes came to an end when the Second World War was over, 45 years ago. Yet, at the same time, they continue to perpetrate crimes against the Arabs, crimes which have gone on to this very day, and to which we do not see an end in the near future.
The rulers of Israel are attempting to maintain the so-called purity of the Jewish State aid yet at the same time they persist in continuing their occupation, of Arab lands. This has placed them in a state of continuous confrontation in their attempt to clear the land of its people, and has led them to carry out practices even more heinous than the racist practices of apartheid South Africa. It is a contradiction in terms for the Israelis to protest against the General
\assembly resolution which equated Zionism with racism while the rulers of Israel themselves confirm the validity and credibility of this resolution by their repressive measures against the Arab population in the occupied territories.
The Israelis do not want peace because they want both peace and the land, his they cannot achieve. Any initiative within this framework of Israeli concepts cannot succeed. The heroic Palestinian intifadah, the brave resistance in southern Lebanon, the steadfastness of our people in the occupied Syrian Golan, were all, first and foremost, a revolt against these very concepts. 
Peace cannot be achieved without a full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and without the safeguarding of the inalienable national rights of the Arab Palestinian people, including its right to self-determination and to establish its own State in Palestine, in accordance with United Nations resolutions.
The Syrian Arab Republic believes that the appropriate framework in which to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East is an international conference, convened under United Nations auspices, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.
In the period between September 1988 and September this year Lebanon witnessed the worst chapter in the history of its civil war. Today as the artillery has fallen silent, as the Lebanese are emerging from their shelters, as the evacuees are returning home, as dialogue has started between the Lebanese members of Parliament, and as genuine stands can be distinguished from false ones, it may not seem as pressing as it once was to talk about Lebanon in detail.
However, events during that period in the brotherly country of Lebanon - the killing, destruction and homelessness, accompanied by a most misleading mass media campaign - are not simple matters that can be ignored or forgotten. That is particularly so since the plot was not directed only at Lebanon and the unity of its people and territory? it was also aimed at putting pressure on Syria and all that Syria represents, but Syria stood staunch and steadfast in the face of the greedy Israeli designs. The plot was also aimed at drawing a thick veil over the Palestinian intifadah and the aspirations for liberation and independence that it represents.
Thus the plot was not as small as its instrument in East Beirut, nor was it such as was deliberately portrayed to many people all over the world. Rather, we can say without any hesitation that what that distorted picture was intended to establish was only part of a larger scenario for the plot, whose major perpetrators, both regionally and internationally, tried not to appear openly on the stage where the events were played out.
Certain countries devoted themselves to guiding those events. Many capitals were mobilized to escalate them; huge amounts of weapons and ammunition were shipped to keep the fires blazing; secret contacts were made to follow up the events; warships and fleets were moved and manoeuvred; prayer meetings were held; and the Security Council was convened more than once to contain the events.
Those who designed the events tried to turn the facts upside down, in an attempt to achieve their goals. In that they were abetted by organized campaigns of misinformation on the international level. Hence, from their distorted perspective, the chief of a minority military Government in East Beirut was made to be seen as if he had become the President of the whole of Lebanon. Thus they totally ignored the Lebanese Parliament and the Prime Minister of the national Government in West Beirut, which represents the overwhelming majority of the Lebanese people, Muslims and Christians alike.
Then they invoked that false claim in order to portray the problem as if it were a problem between Syria and Lebanon, and not, as it really is, between a minority of Lebanese, who had maintained a monopoly over power under the constitution laid down by the French Mandate authorities in 1926, and the majority of Lebanese, who are demanding political and constitutional reforms in order to guarantee the equality of all Lebanese citizens.
On the basis of those fallacies the perpetrators of the events then made another desperate attempt to claim that the Syrian presence in Lebanon was illegal. By so doing, they aimed to attain three goals at the same time: first,
to cover up the illegality of the minority military Government-, secondly, to avoid meeting the just demands of the Lebanese majority for reforms and equality, and, thirdly, to justify the continuation of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon.
At any rate, the recent statement by the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State was a positive turning point in the dangerous course of events that Lebanon has witnessed since September last year. That statement called for a cease-fire, the lifting of the blockades and the formation of a Lebanese security committee to monitor the cease-fire and to inspect ships in order to prevent shipments of arms and supplies to any party. That is exactly what Syria has been calling on all the Lebanese parties to accept ever since the outbreak of the bloody events in Lebanon, because we believe that those elements constitute the only right way to begin dialogue between the Lebanese parties and to bring about a political solution to the Lebanese crisis.
Syria promptly endorsed the Committee's statement. It also stressed its support for the Committee's efforts to implement the resolution on Lebanon adopted by the Arab summit at Casablanca and affirmed its commitment to help the Lebanese government eventually formed at the outcome of national reconciliation to extend its authority over the whole of the Lebanese territory. In so doing it was motivated by the distinct Syrian-Lebanese relationship, which draws its strength from the roots of kinship, history and common strategic interests. Syria welcomes the beginning of implementation of the United lotions plan for Namibia's independence. We hope that the plan will be fully implemented and that elections will take place next month, as scheduled, without intimidation, threats or interference, so that the people of Namibia will be enabled to achieve independence and sovereignty over the whole of its territory, and to become masters
of their destiny under the leadership of the South West Africa People's organization.
However, we must not forget the disgraceful racist regime, which the international community has condemned and whose practices it has deemed a crime against humanity. There should be an intensification of international efforts to isolate the Pretoria regime and to support the black majority, so that it nay be enabled to eradicate the racist regime and realize the national aspirations of the people of South Africa, for freedom and equality.
With regard to the situation in Afghanistan we believe that there is a need to adhere faithfully and accurately to the terms of the Geneva Agreements without any interference or intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, to preserve of its territorial integrity and non-aligned status, and to establish a government of national reconciliation which would represent all segments of the Afghan people.
Syria, which enjoys historic relations of friendship with Cyprus, expresses its hope that the ongoing contacts between the Greek and Turkish communities will lead to a comprehensive settlement of the question of Cyprus based on relevant United Nations resolutions. In this respect, Syria supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General aimed at finding a solution to this problem.
We wish once again to renew our support for the efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea peacefully to reunite the Korean peninsula through negotiations and for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
International economic relations continue to be based on unjust and unbalanced foundations and therefore these relations will need to be reshaped and restructured in order to create a new economic order that would help to achieve balanced social and economic growth in the world. The special session of the General Assembly to be convened in April 1990 and devoted to international economic co-operation takes on particular importance as regards the solutions to basic problems that stand in the way of growth in developing countries, foremost among which are problems of external debt, financial and monetary problems, international trade, the prices of raw materials in developing countries, problems of a scientific and technological order and problems of nutrition, agriculture and environment.
In this respect it is worth mentioning that the political improvement in the international climate and in international relations does not necessarily constitute a parallel factor in improving international economic relations, particularly vis-Ã -vis the developing countries.
The policy of self-reliance and the encouragement of South-South co-operation are two basic prerequisites for the improvement of the economies of developing countries and encouraging industrial countries to start a serious dialogue on an equal footing between North and South because it is in the vital interests of all the peoples of the world.
Following the improvement in the international climate the peoples of the world look to this international forum as a place in which to find effective solutions to the complicated problems from which they suffer, whether those problems result from aggression and oppression or from poverty and environmental pollution. These aspirations are not easy to achieve although they remain legitimate and attainable provided good intentions and political will prevail among us all.
","President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, particularly, as your country, Nigeria, and mine, Syria, enjoy long-standing relations of friendship, and both are members of the Non-Aligned Countries, in which our two countries are united in the common struggle against colonialism and all forms of racism.

44,1989,CMR,"ï»¿
Mr. President, your country, Nigeria, shares a large number of common interests and affinities with Cameroon, which need no emphasizing now. Your presence in the President's seat at this late hour is clear evidence of the links between and the shared concerns of our two countries and peoples. Your personal interest in the problems of our continent, Africa, is shown by your dynamic action as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid.
On behalf of Cameroon, I should like to congratulate you most warmly on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your qualities and experience guarantee the success of the work of this session. I should like to take this opportunity to assure you of the constant co-operation of the Cameroon delegation.
I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, who, throughout his term of office, so skilfully discharged his responsibilities.
I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. We should like again to state our confidence in him and our support for his tireless and effective efforts on behalf of peace and international co-operation.
Our time is one of interdependence and solidarity, which are so indispensable between nations, regions and peoples. The common destiny of mankind in the face of the many dangers threatening all countries, large or small, rich or poor, has become an inescapable reality of our time. Also inescapable are the fundamental aspirations of all nations and peoples concerning their own welfare. Thanks to the tremendous progress of science and technology, particularly communications, our planet has become a global village, as will the whole human community. We must therefore learn without delay the lessons of this common destiny of mankind. The reduction of tension throughout the world in the search for solutions to the various local conflicts in various regions are all factors which can create an international environment that is stable and secure and that favours economic and social development. That is why bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament, security and development, must be stepped up, as must be efforts to extinguish the various existing hot-beds of tension. In this regard, we continue to encourage the new climate of dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States. We hope to see this climate, which has already produced appreciable results, become even more marked in the interests of those two great nations and the world at large. We welcome the undertaking of the two super-Powers to continue to report to the international community, and particularly to the Conference on Disarmament, on the progress and results of their bilateral negotiations.
We note with satisfaction the willingness of all States to intensify their negotiations on the crucial questions of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. In this regard, the holding, in Paris this January, of the International Conference on the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons and recent progress in the Conference on Disarmament on work on an international convention on this important question are encouraging elements in the process of disarmament, which Cameroon fully supports. This optimism is confirmed by the proposals made recently from this rostrum by the President of the United States and by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union.
As representatives are aware, over the last few years my country has submitted a number of proposals on strengthening the role of the United Nations in the disarmament field, on rationalization of the work of the First Committee, and on consolidation of regional peace and security in Africa. We are encouraged by the Assembly's attentive reception of these proposals. We hope that they will contribute to concrete, action-oriented decisions.
In this context, we want to stress the decisive and fundamental role played by United Nations peace-keeping forces in the process of the settlement of various conflicts throughout the world, which earned them the Nobel Peace Prize last year. Indeed, the implementation and management of peace-keeping operations are among the central activities of this Organization. It is important, therefore, for Member States to provide the Secretary-General with the necessary administrative machinery for the centralization and following up of all questions relating to military forces and observer groups deployed by the Organization.
That is why my country proposes the creation, within the Secretariat, of an integrated administrative structure for the co-ordination and effective carrying out of the various missions and operations decided upon by the Security Council for the maintenance of peace. This is the appropriate place to express our satisfaction at the consensus that has emerged as to the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations and international negotiating machinery. The establishment of international dialogue, which is an essential element in the universal search for peace, has made it possible to take dynamic and concrete initiatives to facilitate the settlement of many regional problems.
In southern Africa, the process of Namibian independence, which was launched on 1 April 1989 by the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), is now under way. It is the duty of the United Nations to work tirelessly for the success of this process. We must make it impossible for South Africa - which has accustomed us to trickery, bad faith and all kinds of subterfuges - to interfere with the functioning or distort the results of this process. At this crucial stage in the history of the Territory, Cameroon, which is a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, calls upon the international community to render all necessary assistance to the South West Africa People's Organization, which is the legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Above all, we should give thought to the provision of high-quality assistance to the young Namibian nation to enable it to bring about its independence and development in the best possible conditions. Cameroon wishes to announce its readiness to strengthen even further its aid to the Namibian people - to establish, consolidate and develop with that country, when it becomes independent, reciprocal and mutually advantageous co-operation of all kinds.
The new peace dynamic launched recently in Angola and in Mozambique, thanks to the efforts of Africa, should be strengthened in order to permit those two countries to preserve their sovereignty and to devote themselves wholly to the economic and social development they need so urgently.
In South Africa, the odious system of apartheid persists. The most elementary freedom of movement is denied to the majority black population simply because of their colour. The state of emergency is being stepped up. Nelson Mandela and many other leaders of the anti-apartheid movement are still in prison. Beyond the ostensibly conciliatory attitude that the racist regime authorities have been adopting for some time now, there are no grounds for assuming that Pretoria is ready to abandon its policy of apartheid and its acts of aggression against the front-line States.
We should not lose sight of the fact that this situation, which is explosive in the short term, could get out of control and become catastrophic for the world, in view of the nuclear capacity that has been acquired by the racist South African regime, as well as its arrogance and its thirst for power and blind domination. The international community should not hesitate to use the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to prevail upon South Africa to co-operate with the United Nations - not to reform the system of apartheid but to eradicate it. We appeal urgently to all those whose complicity of all kinds has hitherto enabled South Africa to defy the international community with impunity to participate actively in dismantling apartheid and bringing about a new era of peace and security in that part of the world.
As to the other hot-beds of tension, we must commit ourselves to pragmatic and realistic solutions in accordance with the spirit and principles of our Charter.
On Western Sahara, we should spare no effort to make it possible for the initiatives that are under way to yield positive results under the aegis of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
On the conflict between Chad and Libya, we are happy about the observance of the cease-fire, which has now been in force for more than a year, and the willingness of the two parties to continue their dialogue under the auspices of the ad hoc committee of the OAU, of which Cameroon is a member, with a view to normalizing their relations. The recent agreement between Algiers and the two countries is undoubtedly the decisive stage in the peaceful settlement of this dispute. It is our great hope that the terms of this agreement will be put into effect as soon as possible so that a new era of peace and co-operation may be established between these two sister nations of our continent.
In the horn of Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia have normalized their relations. Other mediation efforts to achieve peace are under way in the sub region.
With regard to the Middle East, we welcome the signs of positive developments and hope that they will soon bring about a restoration of peace in the region. We must gird ourselves to search, together, for peace there. Cameroon, which has excellent relations with both Israel and the Arab States, believes that this peace requires recognition of the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their own homeland, and also the equally fundamental right of the State of Israel to live in peace within internationally recognized frontiers. The time has come for the international community to take the necessary steps to convene the International Conference on this subject.
As to other parts of the world where hot-beds of tension persist, whether in Central America or in Asia, the principles of international law enshrined in our Charter - non-interference in the internal affairs of States; peaceful settlement of disputes; non-use of force in international relations - should be accepted by all as the basis for politically negotiated solutions. In this context, we support the Tela Agreements with a view to the normalization of relations between the countries of Central America. We also hope for continuation of peace negotiations on Cambodia within the framework and in the spirit of the recent international conference in Paris.
The world continues to face a grave economic crisis. The relative resumption of growth in the rich countries has not been accompanied by the hoped-for beneficial trickle-down effect in the countries of the third world. Those countries, which are living in the most wretched conditions ever known in this century, as well as conflicts of various kinds, constitute a serious threat to the peace, stability and security of all mankind and warrant our keenest attention. In this regard, the economic and financial situation of Africa has aroused the greatest possible concern.
The situation is exacerbated by such factors as the following: the deep structural imbalances that mark the world economy ; trade restrictions and protectionist pressures; deteriorating terms of exchange following the brutal plunge in commodity prices and erratic exchange-rate fluctuations; the intolerable growth of the debt burden; the negative flow of capital; and the lack of political will for the establishment of a just and equitable new international economic order.
International economic co-operation as it is understood today is unlikely to promote the true development of our young nations. That certainly constitutes a serious threat to the very foundations of international peace and security. It is therefore urgent to review the machinery of international economic exchange in order to maintain commodity prices at a level that would guarantee fair remuneration to the producers. In that context, we await with considerable interest the first actions by the Common Fund for commodities, which has now become operational.
We welcome the international community's search for appropriate solutions to the debt problem. Measures taken by the two recent summits of the Seven, held at Toronto and at Paris, and by some developed countries are positive actions that deserves to be encouraged.
We should also encourage and strengthen the possibility of intervention by international development institutions, which should be given fresh impetus. Such action can be effective only in a broader framework of a resumed North-South dialogue and global negotiations making it possible to identify in the relations among the parties various aspects of the world economy with a view to promoting growth and development.
In that connection, Cameroon supports the convening next year of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation. If such a session is to succeed, we must first of all learn the lessons of the present decade and ensure that the new development strategy takes advantage of opportunities before it. We must therefore stress the importance of a change in attitude by the principal world economic partners. On both sides, we must avoid ideological squabbling and focus pragmatically on the substantive questions that underlie our poverty and underdevelopment.
We also support holding an international conference on African debt, which would enable the parties concerned to find realistic solutions that would break the vicious cycle of indebtedness. We want objective and equitable solutions to that debt that could safeguard the development process in our countries and secure the welfare of our peoples. We need true international solidarity. As the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Mr. Paul Biya, has said,
'There can be true solidarity only with the strictest respect for the dignity and freedom of others'.
For that reason, we call on all our partners to participate constructively in that international conference, giving expression to the solidarity that must unite all countries and nations. I stress that such a conference could gain impetus in the framework of the United Nations, which has already formulated a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.
Of course, our continent must be able to count first and foremost on itself. It is therefore determined to give fresh impetus to agricultural development, to make more rational use of its human resources, to improve the management of the economy through restructuring, and to strengthen co-operation within regional and sub-regional organizations. 
Africa now expects the international community to show the extra political will by supporting its own efforts through the adoption of concrete measures both bilaterally and in the framework of international economic, financial and monetary institutions. It is our difficult but lofty duty to preserve mankind and create a world of peace and prosperity. In that context, questions of the environment and human rights are of paramount importance. We welcome the 1992 convening of a United Nations conference on environment and development. The recent dangerous damage to the ozone layer, natural disasters, drought, desertification, the dumping of toxic waste in Africa and other parts of the world and many other ecological disasters point to the urgency of convening such a conference. We must work to reconcile the protection of the environment with the imperatives of growth for the developing countries. At stake is the very survival of mankind.
It has become the custom to speak much of human rights questions while stressing their civil and political aspects. Cameroon feels that human rights should be understood in their most complete and comprehensive sense, including economic, social and cultural rights and, above all, the right to development. We feel too that greater importance should be attached to the protection of the child, whose rights to health, nutrition and education do not always get the priority attention they deserve. Cameroon warmly supports initiatives by the United Nations Children's Fund with respect to the declaration of a decade for the African child, the organization of a world summit on the child, and the formulation of a convention on the rights of the child. We hope the international community will give those initiatives the support they deserve.
We are here because we have faith in the ability of multilateralism to find global solutions to the problems of our day. We reaffirm that peace, disarmament and development are goals that can be reached.
Harsh economic conditions and the evils they spawn - poverty, misery, political instability and lack of security - are inextricably bound together. Recognition of those bonds gives all political leaders a new imperative reason to consider and work to improve everyone's access to well-being. Political wisdom dictates the search for a more stable, just and equitable new international order. It calls on us to work for a global, common search for viable solutions to the many problems arising from the extreme poverty in which three quarters of mankind lives, world stability must be our first concern in the search for the well-being of nations and the advent of a better world.
Such a world means the reversal of harmful trends that have long marked international relations. Above all, it means that all States must renew their faith and their commitment to the ideals, purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, which must truly guide the main trends of relations among States. In that context, the Organization must be able to play a larger, more active role in promoting international peace, security and co-operation. Its principal organs - the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the Office of the Secretary-General - should be strengthened and revitalized in order to increase their effectiveness and promote more democratic international relations.
We must give full support to the Secretary-General in that endeavour. We must not follow standard practice in asking too much of the Organization without giving it in return what it needs to play an effective role in regulating our higher common interests, of which peace, international security and co-operation are the decisive elements. We can do this only if, as States and regions, we display firm determination to promote policies leading to an international climate fostering trust among States, peace, the elimination of conflicts, disarmament and the promotion of justice and equity. Within this process the major Powers, most of which are founding Members of this Organization and which have special responsibilities under the Charter, should set an example. It is up to them particularly to play a major role in accordance with the spirit of the Charter of San Francisco.
At this time of profound change we welcome the dynamic action taken by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which, as always, has made a major contribution to the positive development of international relations. At its recent ninth summit Conference, in Belgrade, our Movement once again presented to the world its ideas, priorities and vision, which, in the final analysis, sum up the aspirations of the whole of mankind to a safer, more just and equitable world.
The realism, wisdom and relevance of the consensus reflected in the final Declaration adopted at that summit Conference is eloquent testimony to the movement of this group in the right direction, and we should welcome that. This is a sign of the modernization, maturity and growing credibility of the non-aligned countries.
 All the questions of the hour that are crucial for the future of mankind now have a world-wide dimension. That is why my country, Cameroon, remains convinced that the United Nations remains the best place for activating the various negotiations designed to make significant progress towards a new order. In the final analysis the United Nations constitutes an irreplaceable centre for harmonizing the positions of nations in order to preserve future generations from the scourge of war and to leave them a better and better world.
","The new peace dynamic launched recently in Angola and in Mozambique, thanks to the efforts of Africa, should be strengthened in order to permit those two countries to preserve their sovereignty and to devote themselves wholly to the economic and social development they need so urgently. On the conflict between Chad and Libya, we are happy about the observance of the cease-fire, which has now been in force for more than a year, and the willingness of the two parties to continue their dialogue under the auspices of the ad hoc committee of the OAU, of which Cameroon is a member, with a view to normalizing their relations. Cameroon, which has excellent relations with both Israel and the Arab States, believes that this peace requires recognition of the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their own homeland, and also the equally fundamental right of the State of Israel to live in peace within internationally recognized frontiers. As to other parts of the world where hot-beds of tension persist, whether in Central America or in Asia, the principles of international law enshrined in our Charter - non-interference in the internal affairs of States; peaceful settlement of disputes; non-use of force in international relations - should be accepted by all as the basis for politically negotiated solutions. It calls on us to work for a global, common search for viable solutions to the many problems arising from the extreme poverty in which three quarters of mankind lives, world stability must be our first concern in the search for the well-being of nations and the advent of a better world."
44,1989,JAM,"ï»¿
Just over one year ago my country, Jamaica, was devastated by one of the worst hurricanes in our history. At that time we received generous and spontaneous assistance from the international community, from a large number of individual countries, large and small, and from thousands of individuals within those countries. This assistance supplemented the heroic efforts of our own people and enabled us to repair the physical damage and resume a reasonable approximation to normal activity in a shorter time than originally seemed possible. But, even so, the structural and underlying economic damage still presents us with formidable challenges. This experience gives us a special feeling of sympathy aid solidarity with the peoples of the Eastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico and South Carolina that have recently suffered similar devastation from hurricane Hugo. We extend to them our deep and heartfelt sympathy. We have ourselves given whatever immediate help we could, particularly to our Caribbean Community partners - Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Antigua. We stand ready to do whatever else we can. We strongly endorse the appeals to the international community to assist those countries as generously now as we ourselves were assisted in our time of need.
On a happier note, Sir, we extend to you our warmest and most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. You are one of Africa's most experienced and skilled diplomats, and we therefore believe that your election augurs well for the success of our deliberations in this important session. The historical links and close fraternal relations that have existed between your country aid ours gives us a special aid particular pleasure in welcoming your leadership in these deliberations. Tb your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, of Argentina, we join previous speakers in expressing sincere appreciation for the constructive and able manner in which he presided over the affairs of the forty-third session.
It is particularly significant and must give you, Sir, a special sense of gratification that your presidency of the assembly coincides with the moment when a long-awaited and long-overdue political development is taking place in southern Africa. The fact that we can look forward to the completion of Namibia's progress towards independence not only is a source of satisfaction to all those who have struggled so tirelessly and persistently against South Africa's obstinate and illegal hold over that Territory, but is a tribute to the work of the United Nations in mobilizing the world community around this issue.
But we must not celebrate too soon. We have to remain vigilant to ensure that even at this late stage South Africa does not succeed in subverting the electoral and constitutional arrangements for Namibia's independence. We are deeply concerned at reports of widespread harassment, intimidation and killings of supporters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). We must continue to insist that South Africa scrupulously comply with the full implementation of resolution 435 (1978) in its original and definitive form so that the people of Namibia can participate freely and without intimidation or violence in the electoral process, under the control and supervision of the United Nations. We in Jamaica have joined with others in sending personnel to Namibia for the purpose of ensuring these objectives, and we are a part of a Commonwealth team that is now in Namibia investigating and monitoring the ongoing process. We trust that the Security Council will lend its full weight to ensure that South Africa proceeds to disband all its paramilitary and commando units, particularly Koevoet, that still threaten the implementation of orderly progress towards independence.
This brings us once again to a consideration of South Africa itself and that odious blot on human civilization known as the practice and doctrine of apartheid.
We must never forget, either here car anywhere else in the civilized world, that apartheid is not merely another eccentric or aberrant political system. It is both in theory and in practice a crime against humanity. Apartheid cannot be reformed? it can only be destroyed. The international community cannot, therefore, relations commitment to the eradication of apartheid, but must persist in its demand for the lifting of the state of emergency, the release of all political prisoners and detainees, including Nelson Mandela, an end to the harassment of anti-apartheid activists and, most important of all, the free and unrestricted participation of all political groups aid parties in the political life of South Africa. We look forward to the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly, in December, which will focus on apartheid and at which we must ensure that additional concrete steps are taken to increase the pressure on the South African regime to abandon apartheid in all its forms and dimensions.
Jamaica was the first State to apply trade sanctions to South Africa. Since then many others have followed suit, end we remain consistent in our determination to continue to press for the ever-widening adoption of this strategy. Moreover, we believe that the extension of this strategy into the area of embargo en all forms of financial flaws is the surest way of achieving a non-violent solution to the South African situation. The fact remains, however, that not enough is being done in this regard by the major industrial countries and the major transnational corporations that have still continued to do business with South Africa. This makes it possible for the regime to continue to exist, even in the face of universal moral condemnation. The soothing words aid cosmetic gestures now coming out of Pretoria should not be mistaken for a genuine commitment by that regime to eradicate apartheid. They are primarily designed to prevent or dilute precisely the kind of effective economic pressure which the major countries and major
transnational corporations can exert upon Pretoria. Nevertheless, the fact that these words are being used and these gestures are being made does indicate that such sanctions as are in place are having soma effect. They also point to the fact that there is a significant and growing body of opinion within the white community in South Africa that recognizes both the basic immorality aid the ultimate non-viability of the system. If we are serious about ending apartheid, then this is the moment when we should seek every possible means to intensify the pressures on the regime.
I now turn to look at the present situation in the region of which my country is a part - Latin America and the Caribbean. There is no doubt that at the political level considerable progress has been made towards the reduction of tensions aid the enlargement of political freedom and the democratic process. In Central America particularly, the Agreements, concluded last August by the five Central American Presidents at Tela, Honduras, have given dramatic impetus to the regional peace process, to the strengthening of the movement towards democratic pluralism aid to the establishment of political stability in that region. We note with satisfaction the arrangements which have now been finalized for the establishment of an international support and verification commission, involving the deployment of United Nations military observers, and the important step taken by the Government of Nicaragua in inviting the united Nations and other bodies to send teams of observers to monitor its own electoral process. We strongly commend the Secretary-General, who, through the skilful use of his good offices mission, has unremittingly persisted in efforts to obtain a negotiated solution to the Central American conflict.
He should also take note of the fact that Haiti., after many setbacks, appears to be heading towards a restoration of democracy, but it is still too early to be sure that this process will move smoothly to its completion. A ministerial delegation from the Caribbean Community, in which Jamaica participated, visited Haiti recently end held talks with a wide cross-section of the Haitian population in an effort to encourage this process. The announcement of a date in the next year for the holding of elections is encouraging, aid the members of the Caribbean Community have pledged to give every assistance to the Government and people of Haiti so long as we see steady progress continuing towards this objective.
On the other hand, it is distressing to observe that in Panama a regressive movement away from democratic aid constitutional government was set in motion with the aborting of the elections in May of this year and with the installation of an unrepresentative puppet regime, which took office on 1 September. This melancholy picture has, however, been brightened by certain factors', first, by the strong support expressed by all Latin American coin tries, through the Organization of American States (OAS), for the Panamanian people in their quest for the restoration of proper democratic and constitutional government and the rule of law? secondly, by the efforts of the OAS itself; and, thirdly, by the willingness of the united States to refrain from unilateral action, and to work within the multilateral inter-American system. While these efforts have not, so far, brought the desired result, we in Jamaica believe very strongly that this is the right way to proceed and that if the efforts are persisted in, firmly and consistently, an appropriate and acceptable solution will be arrived at. In the final analysis, it is the Panamanian people who have to decide their own destiny. But the international community must give strong and appropriate support to those which seek a speedy return to constitutional government.
There are, unfortunately, other areas of the world in which long-existing and seemingly intractable disputes continue not only to bring misery and insecurity to the peoples of the countries affected but also, in may instances, to create areas of tension and potential super-Power confrontation, which could threaten world peace ad security. I refer particularly, of course, to the Middle East, Afghanistan and Kampuchea. This Organization must continue its efforts in all these areas, however may disappointments ad frustrations may be experienced.
There is, however, one general area in respect of which we can only express the most profound satisfaction, ad which holds out the greatest promise for the future of mankind. I refer to the notable improvement in the relations between the super-Powers, the continued progress in disarmament ad arms control, ad the developing convergence of attitudes of the countries of the Eastern and Western blocs. It would, of course, be premature to say that the bipolar world which emerged at the end of the Second World War, and which has been the dominant feature of the past 45 years of world history, is now a thing of the past. Nevertheless, there is good reason to believe that it is becoming so. For the first time, we can dare to believe that the threat of humanity's being destroyed in a nuclear confrontation between East and West will be lifted permanently, and that an era of co-operation, rather than confrontation, between the major ideological ad political systems of the world is becoming a real possibility and not just a Utopia dream.
But, even as we recognize and applaud these favourable developments in the political field, we must also recognize that for the majority of mankind the current world economic situation presents a far less favourable picture. Even as the spectre of the mushroom cloud recedes from our immediate vision, there are other spectres, less instantly dramatic but perhaps just as deadly in the lag run,
that demand the attention of the world community. It is to these other natters that X now turn.
In general economic terms, the decade of the 1980s has been a bleak and, in many cases, disastrous one for most countries of the developing world. The industrialized countries of Europe, North America and Japan have experienced steady growth, rapid technological advance and increasing affluence. By and large, however, they have tended to keep their increasing wealth to themselves - official development aid to, and capital investment in, the developing countries have declined in real terms. Indeed, debt-servicing payments, the fall in commodity prices and tine drying-up of commercial lending to the debtor countries have resulted in a massive transfer of real resources from the developing to the developed industrialized countries.
It is true that a handful of developing countries - primarily in East Asia - have experienced spectacular growth and are on the threshold of graduating into developed industrial economies with huge financial surpluses and improved living standards, But for the vast majority of developing countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and West Asia the picture has been radically different. Here the picture has been, by and large, one of negative growth, declining per capita income and - what is even worse from the long-term point of view - a decline in standards and levels of education, nutrition, health care and housing. These are, of course, the essentials of human-resource development, without which no sustainable economic growth is possible. A vicious downward spiral has been created whereby, in many countries, the social fabric and political stability are increasingly threatened by a rising tide of misery.
Central to this melancholy picture is the debt crisis - both a symptom and a cause of increasing impoverishment in much of the developing world. Oceans of analysis and of prescriptions have been produced on the subject of the debt crisis,
but there has been barely a trickle of effective action to arrive at any definitive amelioration of the problem.
The debtor countries, for their part, have sought - indeed, have been obliged - to follow the path of structural adjustment. In so doing, they have increased their export volume markedly - by some 56 per cent over the decade - and have reduced their import volume by 13 per cent. But, in spite of this tremendous effort and achievement, their debt burden has not been reduced. Indeed, it has increased and is continuing to increase. Over the last three years, the external debt of developing countries has moved from 31,152 billion to 31,320 billion. For the 17 most indebted countries, the net transfer of resources to creditor countries totalled in the year 1988 alone approximately 331 billion. Moreover, the immediate effect of these structural adjustment programmes is often to exacerbate income imbalances within a national economy. This results in the highly explosive situation whereby the production of a stagnant or shrinking economy is being divided in an increasingly unequal fashion.
It is clear that the debtor countries cannot get out of their predicament by their own efforts alone. It is clear also that the lending institutions - both the commercial banks and the multilateral lending agencies - are limited, in the contribution that they can make to a solution, by the imperatives of their own operational requirements and, in many instances, by their own basic rules and regulations.
A much more significant contribution is required from the Governments of surplus creditor countries than they have so far been prepared to make. It is disappointing to note that yet another meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund has come and gone without any indication, from these countries, of a willingness to make the kind of response that the situation requires.
The fact is that, while the creditor countries cannot be said to be comfortable with the present situation, because they recognize its long-term dangers to world trade and international stability, they are, however, not so uncomfortable as to be prepared to make the effort and incur the political risks that would be involved in their taking the kind of financial action that is required.
In our view the time has come for the united Nations to take the lead in organizing a constructive dialogue leading to effective action among all the parties involved, the debtor nations, the lending institutions and the creditor countries. A special session of the General Assembly to be convened in 1990 for the purpose of focusing on international economic co-operation could provide the opportunity for such a dialogue. We believe that out of such a dialogue an agreement should emerge to establish an international debt organization funded by contributions from the creditor nations for the purpose of acquiring significant portions of outstanding sovereign debt from the commercial banks at market-determined discounts and passing on the benefit of these discounts to the debtor countries.
In addition, the multilateral lending institutions should be permitted to refinance and restructure their loans so as to eliminate net transfers to them from heavily indebted countries. The debtor countries, as a condition of obtaining this relief, should be required to implement sound economic programmes that would enable them to service their reduced debt obligations and accumulate a sufficient surplus to resume the process of economic growth, social development and a more equitable sharing of the products of their economic systems. By this kind of collaborative effort, with all three parties making an appropriate contribution, there will emerge a real possibility of achieving a permanent solution to the debt crisis, thus creating expanded world trade and a healthier global environment for productive investment from which all people will benefit.
If, as I have said, there is a lack of balance in the degree of seriousness with which creditor and debtor countries view the debt crisis, there are two other problems about which there can be no doubts that all countries of the world, big and small, developed and undeveloped, must share an equally urgent concern. The first of these is the safeguarding of our environment. The dangers posed to the future of the human race, and indeed to all life on this planet, by the continued pollution and degradation of the total natural environment is at last beginning to get the focus and intensity of attention that it has always deserved. While sound national environmental policies are central to any effort in this regard, there is no doubt that concerted action by the international community is also urgently required.
The numerous environmental problems that are global in nature, which many countries are not equipped to tackle on their own, demand and require a multilateral response. Water and air pollution, soil erosion, waste disposal - to name just a few - all require an increasingly high level of international initiative. Such plans for international action, however, must recognize that in so far as poor developing countries are concerned, there is a causal relationship between environmental degradation, poverty, low educational levels and sheer lack of access to environmentally sound energy and other resources.
The proposed 1992 conference on environment and development represents a step in the right direction towards international co-operation. We must be alert to seize the opportunity to look at all aspects of the problem and to recognize that the alleviation of the economic problems in the poorer countries of the world is an essential pre-condition for the maintenance of sound environmental practices.
This is particularly evident in relation to matters such as deforestation. It is unrealistic 'co believe that people who have no access to any other source of energy to warm themselves or to cook their food will refrain from cutting down trees for firewood out of deference to the possible ecological effects of their actions in some seemingly distant future.
Finally, I turn to the problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking. Mrs. Margaret Anstee, Director-General of the united Nations Office in Vienna responsible for the united Nations work on this issue, said recently about the narcotic threat: 'It is a threat striking at the foundation of civilization and places peace and security in their most fundamental sense increasingly in jeopardy'.
Just a few days ago, President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia passionately and movingly described from this rostrum the mortal danger in which his country stands as a result of this increasingly dangerous scourge. There is no doubt that the drug problem has today assumed proportions that are far beyond the capacity of individual States to control. The production, illicit trafficking and distribution of narcotics have resulted in the growth of some of the most terrible criminal organizations the world has ever seen. This is not a problem that affects one or two countries. Nor is it limited to specific areas of the world. Like bizarre caricatures of transnational corporations, the drug cartels are seeking to globalise the financing, production and distribution of their products.
If they succeed, Governments, judicial systems and other national institutions in one country after another will become hostage to them in a horrible game of death and destruction. Nor can responsibility be assigned only to those countries in which illegal narcotics are currently being primarily produced. There is, if anything, an even greater responsibility on those nations which provide the bulk of the consumer market and there is apparently an insatiable and escalating demand.
We acknowledge the valuable work that has long been done by the United Nations in identifying the dangers of this traffic and in exploring ways for encouraging international co-operation in combating it. We express our appreciation to those Governments and individuals that have given such valuable service to the United Nations Commission on narcotic Drugs and provided leadership and guidance for the vital work being carried out by various United Nations bodies. We also acknowledge the useful legal framework to strengthen the capacity of Governments to deal with the illicit production, trafficking and use of narcotic drugs that has been provided by various United Nations conventions. The most recent, of course, was the United Nations Convention concluded in Vienna, in December 1988, which has already been signed by a large number of countries, including my own. But the harsh fact is that, notwithstanding these efforts, this problem has steadily grown to the monstrous and frightening proportions we see today.
In 1986 our Secretary-General made the following statement on drug control in an address to the General Assembly: 'Further forms of co-operative international efforts my well be needed. I wonder, for example, if member States have yet adequately considered the possibility of a strengthened global involvement capability which might reduce the need for Governments to rely on other types of control.'
My Government believes that it is incumbent on the Organization to accept the Secretary-General's challenge. Pursuant to this, our Prima Minister has sought and obtained the support of a number of countries in our Caribbean region, as well as others outside the region, and he will continue to canvass support for a specific proposal we shall be presenting to the General assembly at the appropriate time within the next few weeks. The proposal is for the implementation of a strategy within the united Nations system designed and structured to assist all member countries in their efforts to inhibit the use, interdict the supply and prevent the traffic within and across national boundaries of all illegal narcotic and psychotropic drugs. It is proposed that this strategy would have the following elements : first, a central intelligence-gathering operation which would collate and co-ordinate information on drug trafficking world wide, with particular emphasis on tracing financial flows from this activity; secondly, a training facility for anti-narcotic agents in both investigative and interdiction activities; thirdly, a capability to assist countries that require it in public education designed to control the demand for illicit drugs; fourthly, provision of technical assistance for the creation and maintenance of effective rehabilitation programmes for individuals who have become addicted to narcotic drugs; fifthly, assistance in the planning and administration of income substitution programmes, so as to provide alternative forms of economic activity for persons now engaged in the primary production of narcotic substances, who are often driven to this activity for lack of any other means of livelihood; sixthly, a multilateral and multisectoral unit, operating under United Nations control, consisting of specially trained paramilitary personnel who could be made available to assist countries which request such help to strengthen their own security forces in the war against the well-armed and well-funded forces that protect this illegal traffic.
We believe that in the absence of such an international capability, to which individual countries can look for assistance, two dangerous possibilities exist. A number of countries will find their institutions so corrupted aid their security forces so overwhelmed that an orderly democratic society, governed by the rule of law will become impossible. The other danger is that countries so threatened may feel compelled to invite, or powerless to resist, a degree of involvement in their internal affairs by some other countries to which they are obliged to turn for assistance that will be inconsistent with their sovereignty. These are not imaginary dangers. They are very real and present threats being faced by many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We need hardly emphasize, of course, that the establishment of such a multilateral and multisectoral unit would be based on full respect for each country's sovereignty and would be an instrument available to countries that request it - and only when they request it - and would operate entirely within the limits set by the countries themselves. We hope that this proposal will receive the support of all the members of the United Nations. We are ready and anxious to consult fully with all Member States so as to ensure that the proposed unit - and all the other elements of the strategy that I have outlined - meets such requirements as Members may see necessary, is supported by the necessary financial resources, and comes into existence as rapidly as possible. We therefore ask all Member States to work with us and our co-sponsoring Caribbean Community (CARICCM) partners to achieve a consensus that will provide an effective international answer to this grave and present danger to the international community.
In closing, Jamaica reaffirms its strong commitment to the multilateral process which is enshrined in tine Charter of the United Nations. We continue to pledge our support to this Organization, an Organization which we feel represents the best hope for the future of mankind.
","The international community cannot, therefore, relations commitment to the eradication of apartheid, but must persist in its demand for the lifting of the state of emergency, the release of all political prisoners and detainees, including Nelson Mandela, an end to the harassment of anti-apartheid activists and, most important of all, the free and unrestricted participation of all political groups aid parties in the political life of South Africa. The fact is that, while the creditor countries cannot be said to be comfortable with the present situation, because they recognize its long-term dangers to world trade and international stability, they are, however, not so uncomfortable as to be prepared to make the effort and incur the political risks that would be involved in their taking the kind of financial action that is required. By this kind of collaborative effort, with all three parties making an appropriate contribution, there will emerge a real possibility of achieving a permanent solution to the debt crisis, thus creating expanded world trade and a healthier global environment for productive investment from which all people will benefit. If, as I have said, there is a lack of balance in the degree of seriousness with which creditor and debtor countries view the debt crisis, there are two other problems about which there can be no doubts that all countries of the world, big and small, developed and undeveloped, must share an equally urgent concern.

44,1989,LUX,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government of Luxembourg I wish to convey to our President our warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly. Along with his wealth of diplomatic experience, particularly as Foreign Minister of one of the most important countries in Africa, he has sound qualities enabling him to direct our work wisely and effectively.
On Tuesday Mr. Roland Dumas, Foreign Minister of France, expressed the views of the 12 States Members of the European Community about the main subjects on the current international scene. Since his statement reflected our common concerns, I shall confine myself to giving just a few additional details.
Over the past 12 months we have noted a continued general improvement in international relations. A favourable climate is developing between the Soviet Union and the United States, between East and West and between North and South. Big steps forward have been made in the solution of a number of regional conflicts, making a reality of the favourable prospects noted last year. More and more the military option and military pressure are giving way to negotiation and co-operation, on the basis of the principles of the Charter, as a means of solving international problems.
It is, first, in Europe that we see these favourable developments, accompanied by profound changes. The European Community is pursuing with determination its process of unification. The creation of a single market adds an important dimension to that movement. The Community is open, and will remain open, to all the countries of the world, and, true to its purpose, it is bringing about new opportunities for growth and co-operation for all.
In the light of that process, we welcome the emergence of open and truly democratic societies in Central and Eastern Europe. The first free elections in Poland, which have just taken place, as well as the programme of the new Government resulting from those elections, offers prospects - undoubtedly difficult to make a reality, but extremely encouraging - of the building of a Poland that is master of its own fate and faithful to the identity and the most cherished aspirations of its people.
Similar developments are occurring in Hungary, on the basis of conditions that are peculiar to that country. There, too. the way is now open for a multi-party system.
In the Soviet Union the process of democratisation is making headway. In particular, it has been cemented by the creation of new institutions - the People's Congress and the Supreme Soviet - following elections in which a plurality of candidates was assured.
We hope that the course thus embarked upon will be followed by the other countries of Eastern Europe, so that the end of the twentieth century will be marked by the triumph of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Significant economic restructuring is accompanying those political changes. With them, there will be a progressive elimination of bureaucratic, centralized planning, which will give way to a market economy, one with social responsibility, but based on autonomy of decision-making for those involved in economic life. The vitality of more productive economies will be such as to make it possible to overcome the grave economic problems faced by the countries concerned.
The political and economic reforms will inevitably lead to new forms of co-operation between the European countries. The old psychological and physical barriers have been torn down. Ideas, information and people are circulating freely. The European peoples are rediscovering each other and growing closer. Sound institutions, such as the Council of Europe and even the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, are the foundations on which the desire of Europeans to live together freely and in complete trust can grow.
In that connection, my Government attaches great importance to President Gorbachev's recent assurances that every country is free to choose its own path and that therefore no country can arrogate to itself the right to resort to force to impose its will on others. As that assurance is accompanied by the fact that the Soviet Union is being turned into a State where the rule of law is paramount, it takes on a particular significance.
The very encouraging prospects now seen in the negotiations on conventional weapons in Europe, which have been opened in Vienna, are a persuasive example of the new climate of convergence between the two parts of Europe. By lowering the levels of various categories of weapons, by pledging themselves to increased transparency and predictability in military questions and by defining new confidence-building measures based on strictly defensive strategies, the 23 countries concerned - indeed, the 35 associated with the negotiations - are putting an end to 45 years of suspicion and hostility.
We welcome the resumption of negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons. As regards the negotiations on chemical weapons, President Bush's recent invitation, which the Soviet side has already accepted in principle, will make possible a real advance in this very complex area. We should take advantage of the momentum thus created and speedily conclude a balanced and verifiable agreement.
In Afghanistan, an important part of the Geneva Accords has been implemented with the withdrawal of Soviet troops, in accordance with the timetable laid down, thus putting an end to a foreign occupation which had lasted for more than 10 years. However, the situation continues to he very worrying, because of the deadly struggles still going on between different Afghan factions.
In Cambodia we await the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops by the end of this month. Here, as elsewhere, it seems to me desirable and even inevitable that our Organization should play a paramount role in the search for a peaceful solution and in its implementation.
It is regrettable that the Korean people is still not occupying a seat here as a Member, in violation of our Organization's principle of universality.
There are some encouraging signs with regard to the African continent.
A historic process is culminating in Namibia, thanks to the efforts of the United Nations. We welcome the fact that after the signing of the two agreements last December the implementation of the process laid down in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has finally got under way. I have no doubt that that operation is beneficial for our Organization; it should give us inspiration for the future.
The gradual withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola also gives grounds for satisfaction. It is to be hoped that national reconciliation will now follow. A similar reconciliation effort in Mozambique also deserves our support. The same is true of the negotiations that the Government of Sudan is to undertake with the opposition in the south, as well as the negotiations that the Government of Ethiopia is conducting, on President Carter's initiative, with the representatives of the Eritrean people.
The painful problem of apartheid in South Africa still remains. The elections held at the beginning of this month showed that even among the white population large sections are in favour of change. It is up to the new leaders to carry out their mandate for reform, by immediately freeing Nelson Mandela and the other leaders of the anti-apartheid movements, by ending the state of emergency and by legalizing the opposition parties and movements - in short, by putting an end to the regime of brutal repression, which still exists, and which caused so much violence in the recent elections.
In Central America, the prospects of agreement have never been so good. After the conclusion of the Esquipulas II and Costa del Sol agreements and the recent meeting at Tela on the 7 August, the peace-making mechanism can now start up.
The promise of free elections in Nicaragua, next February, is also an extremely important element in this regard. In El Salvador, the dialogue between the opposing parties also seems to be under way.
Thus all the countries in this region have given effect to their intent to move towards democratic pluralism, respect for human rights, the promotion of social justice and resolution of the serious social economic problems that have been aggravated by 10 years of a pitiless warfare.
In contrast with Africa and Central America, in the Middle East we are witnessing a situation that is constantly deteriorating. The road towards a negotiated solution continues to be blocked. The uprising in the occupied territories is spreading. Day after day there is an increase in the confrontation together with an increase in the number of the dead and wounded and in the suffering of the general population. In the light of the decisions taken by the Security Council, the occupying forces continue to resort to repressive measures which are, inter alia, at variance with the Geneva Convention.
This is particularly regrettable since important changes have taken place in the last year; the decision taken by the Palestinian National Council recognizing the existence of Israel, to give up terrorism and to conduct negotiations on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. The decision of the United States to recognize the existence of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to initiate a dialogue with its representatives is, likewise, an important step in the right direction.
Organizing elections in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, may prove a useful step, provided that it is seen to be part and parcel of an overall process and to the extent that the elections are held under acceptable international safeguards for both parties. The Palestinians have the same rights to existence and to selfâdetermination as those which were demanded and won after so much suffering and tragic sacrifice by Israel.
We cannot be resigned to tragedy which is tightening the stranglehold on Lebanon day by day. The sufferings caused to the Lebanese population are of concern to us all. The coming about of the cease-fire and the resumption of dialogue between the various Lebanese communities, which are all equal in rights and obligations, as well as the withdrawal of all foreign forces, are two prerequisites to cessation of the civil war.
Between Iran and Iraq, the cease-fire has undoubtedly been respected. Nevertheless, it is disappointing to note that the negotiations being conducted by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative with the two parties have not yet yielded the slightest result. Nevertheless, there can be no valid alternative to seeking for a global solution, based on resolution 598 (1987) of the Security Council.
On the question of Cyprus, the SecretaryâGeneral has initiated a new series of intra-community negotiations and submitted to both parties proposals that are intended to be part of a settlement plan. My Government unreservedly supports the action of the Secretary-General and his representative with a view to the continuance and intensification of the negotiations.
The same is true of the conciliation which is being pursued by our Secretary-General with regard to the questions of Western Sahara and East Timor, in order to arrive at a solution based on respect for the aspirations of the peoples of those regions. The intensified search for agreements in various regional problems has led to a systematic resort to, and multiplication of, peace-keeping operations.
Congratulations are due to those United Nations officers who are able to assist in defining, deploying and conducting these operations with admirable skill and effectiveness. These operations are of inestimable service to the cause of peace. They guarantee to the United Nations an unprecedented authority and prestige. Nevertheless, they should not let us overlook the fact that they are only a temporary solution, intended to facilitate the implementation of a final settlement of those conflicts. Their smooth functioning also requires that each State faithfully fulfil its financial obligations, past or present. Regardless of its financial situation, my Government will study practical ways and means of contributing directly to the peace-keeping forces.
You may well imagine the feeling aroused by the craven execution of Lieutenant-Colonel Higgins in Lebanon, who was kidnapped in the course of his duties. This criminal act illustrates the dangers to which members of these international forces are vulnerable when exercising their mission.
The Government of Luxembourg, which is the outcome of recent elections, continues to attach extreme importance to respect for human rights.
More than 40 years ago, our General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At a time when we are celebrating the bicentennial of the French Revolution, it is extremely regrettable to note that more than 60 States, including some of the larger ones, have still not ratified the International Covenants on Human Rights. Furthermore, in many States where the provisions of these instruments are already in force, there is no adequate legal protection or any sufficiently effective sanction machinery to ensure that they are respected.
For the Government of Luxembourg, the educational efforts needed to inform and to awaken the conscience of people and to promote a spirit of tolerance and justice, should be pursued and reinforced. The same is true of the disinterested action of non-governmental organizations that unreservedly commit themselves to promoting the cause of human rights, even going so far as to risk the lives of their members.
In the light of the considerable emotion which in recent years we have been accustomed to feel about certain countries that have little respect for human rights, I should like to add my voice to that of the international community, and call upon the leaders of those countries to put an end to repressive acts and to allow a return to a policy of openness and reform in keeping with the course of history.
Over and above the conflicts and the attacks on individuals, problems connected with the protection of the environment have become subjects of priority concern for universal public opinion: the statements which we have been listening to throughout this week provide clear evidence of this awareness. More and more human beings are affected by the damage caused to ecological balances. The destruction of forests is accelerating, the desert is spreading. The erosion of the soil is threatening agricultural production and the existence of millions of human beings. The pollution of the seas and oceans, and the proliferation of toxic wastes is daily leading to new tragedies. The slow destruction of the ozone layer exposes us to ultraviolet radiation with incalculable consequences.
We are therefore firmly embarked on a course which is designed to prevent further deterioration of the environment. Initiatives successfully taken in recent months, particularly by Margaret Thatcher, Ruud Lubbers and Michel Rocard, as well as the Arche summit which met in Paris last July, have provided us with guidelines which should lead to urgent action. It is up to the international community at present, and therefore to our Organization, to define these priorities Pending the holding of an international conference on the environment, which has been planned for 1992. My Government agrees entirely that there is a need to draw up a model convention to define the problem and to lay down the guidelines for international action through concrete measures.  The destruction of tropical forests by burning, which, in its turn, produces carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, should be halted. The rights of indigenous peoples, particularly along the Amazon, who want to preserve their natural environment should be respected.
A universal policy of protection and maintenance of forests should be launched. We shall succeed in this only if the courageous campaigns conducted by a number of movements working for the protection of the environment create a collective awareness of the situation.
It seems to me that this is a very favourable moment to lay the foundation for lasting growth based on a synthesis between the ecological dimension and man's economic activities, it is primarily up to the industrialized countries, which are mainly responsible for the problem, to meet this challenge, of concern to all mankind. The Organization should create structures that are sufficiently sound, flexible and effective to enable action to be taken when it is required.
Simultaneously, increased attention should be paid to the rapid growth of the world population, which is increasing at the rate of 1 billion every 10 years. This growth rate should be a cause of concern to us in the light of development possibilities and of the constraints that it will place upon the environment. In fact, the economic and social situation in a large number of developing countries remains disquieting. For millions of their inhabitants the 1980s have been a lost decade. This is particularly true of the countries of Latin America and of sub-Saharan Africa, where there has been stagnation and decline. Poverty, hunger
and deprivation are killing 40,000 children every day. That is a shameful situation, which no one can shrug off.
The simple struggle for survival has led large numbers of people in these countries to over-exploit nature. The pressure from debt-servicing, which accounts for, on average, 30 per cent of their exports, has speeded up the excessive exploitation of their natural resources. In other words, short-term economic demands have prompted many Governments not to give ecological problems high priority. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that violence is increasing - indeed, taking on alarming dimensions. In the light of the situation to which they have been doomed, a number of young people are becoming drug addicts, prostitutes and delinquents and are indulging in new forms of criminality. The food riots that have taken place in some developing countries indicate clearly that young people are the victims of the upheavals that poverty has forced upon them. The number of refugees fleeing the warfare, persecution and terrorism, as well as unemployment and underdevelopment, increased from 5 million in 1978 to 14 million currently.
The scope of these problems means that we must redouble our efforts. In particular, the 1990 special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation will provide us with an opportunity to redefine the principles and guidelines for building a world that is fairer and more human. It seems that in order to remedy this situation, and to ensure lasting growth, a substantial reduction in debt and in the cost of debt-servicing would be an important initial step. Following the agreements concluded with Mexico and the Philippines, the Brady Plan could be applied on a broader scale, taking into account the specific features of each situation. In the case of world trade, if the Uruguay Round is successful - as we unreservedly hope that it will be - it is likely that it will create favourable conditions for an increase in exports from the developing countries.
Another evil, which is equally global and equally a threat, is the illicit trafficking in drugs. I urge a resolute strengthening of international co-operation, starting with the swift ratification, by all countries, of the Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and psychotropic Substances, which I have just signed on behalf of Luxembourg. It should be clear that Luxembourg, which is already participating in the working group that emerged from the summit meeting at the Arche de la Defence, will spare no effort in this field. I take this opportunity to welcome the very courageous and determined action that has been taken by the President of Colombia, Mr. Virgilio Barco - action that the Government of Luxembourg supports unreservedly.
Before concluding, I should like to pay a just tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His activity at the head of the Organization, his tireless efforts at mediation and conciliation have revealed his great talent as an organizer and a negotiator. His patient and far-sighted commitment to peace has made a substantial contribution to strengthening the role and importance of the United Nations in international affairs in recent years.
My country has just celebrated the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence. I should like to thank the Secretary-General for having graced with his attendance the public events that took place last April in the presence of seven prime ministers and leaders of the main international organizations to which Luxembourg belongs. This celebration enabled us to relive the progress of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg through the vicissitudes of history. While noting that, in 1989, the future development of our country is surrounded by more favourable conditions than in the past, we must recognize that the life of small States in particular depends more and more on international organizations. Dealing precisely with the role of small States, the Secretary-General said on 18 April in Luxembourg;
'They do not need to think about the danger or cost of endless wars to realize the absurdity of all armed aggression. Being more aware of their vulnerability, small States, or at least those of them that behave rationally, are naturally peaceful and respectful of the law. They also feel more keenly than others the need for international co-operation, which is the purpose of our Organization. Like war, isolation for them would spell suicide. Living by international trade, they are aware of the dangers of protectionism, as well as the soundness of the liberalization of trade and the usefulness of being integrated in broad economic spaces where conflicts are no longer conceivable and where everyone can profit from overall prosperity. Also, they can gauge the importance of regional political co-operation and the international co-operation which it engenders. Luxembourg, therefore plays an even greater role in the United Nations because it is an active member of the European Community, Firm supporters of the Organization, small countries play a particularly useful part in it since they have experience in conciliation and because their interests generally coincide with the general interest.' After that lengthy quotation, I have nothing to add.
For what the Secretary-General has done at the head of the Organization, and for his presence in our country and the words he spoke there, I want simply, from the bottom of my heart, to express our complete gratitude.
","By lowering the levels of various categories of weapons, by pledging themselves to increased transparency and predictability in military questions and by defining new confidence-building measures based on strictly defensive strategies, the 23 countries concerned - indeed, the 35 associated with the negotiations - are putting an end to 45 years of suspicion and hostility. It is up to the new leaders to carry out their mandate for reform, by immediately freeing Nelson Mandela and the other leaders of the anti-apartheid movements, by ending the state of emergency and by legalizing the opposition parties and movements - in short, by putting an end to the regime of brutal repression, which still exists, and which caused so much violence in the recent elections. The coming about of the cease-fire and the resumption of dialogue between the various Lebanese communities, which are all equal in rights and obligations, as well as the withdrawal of all foreign forces, are two prerequisites to cessation of the civil war. In the light of the considerable emotion which in recent years we have been accustomed to feel about certain countries that have little respect for human rights, I should like to add my voice to that of the international community, and call upon the leaders of those countries to put an end to repressive acts and to allow a return to a policy of openness and reform in keeping with the course of history. It seems to me that this is a very favourable moment to lay the foundation for lasting growth based on a synthesis between the ecological dimension and man's economic activities, it is primarily up to the industrialized countries, which are mainly responsible for the problem, to meet this challenge, of concern to all mankind."
44,1989,ITA,"ï»¿Sir, I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am particularly happy to do so because you represent a friendly country and have both the will and the ability to continue the highly valued work of your predecessor at an important juncture in international affairs.
I should also have wished to see here, beside me, someone whom so many of you will remember as a friend and firm supporter of the work of the United Nations, Ambassador Migliuolo, who passed away the other day. I think of him with deep sorrow and affection, recalling his dedicated commitment, both personal and professional. The countries of the European Community have broadly similar views on the main foreign policy issues. As these views have already been expressed by France, there is no need for me to reiterate Italy's position. Instead, I should like to voice my concern that our countries should fully appreciate the international Ganges currently taking place and draw the proper conclusions. Indeed, in the next few years we shall be required increasingly to choose between two policies or approaches. One I would call 'integration' and the other 'disintegration'. Choice of the former course would mean a policy of co-operation, co-ordination and the progressive transfer of national sovereignty, while the latter choice would tend to aggravate conflicts and tensions, inhibit dialogue and weaken the impact of the major international organizations. Our future depends on our ability, through integration, to reconstruct the one world glimpsed as no more than a brief illusion in the immediate post-war period.
Prom this very rostrum President Gorbachev announced last December that the Soviet State had abandoned its philosophy of distinctiveness, dating from its inception, in favour of the idea of interdependence, which is a prerequisite for any form of integration.
The Western countries belonging to the European Community and the Atlantic Alliance responded promptly to this long-awaited change of course. The results are now apparent to all. Countries from opposite - although no longer actively antagonistic - blocs are meeting in Vienna to reduce the size of their conventional arsenals. The Atlantic Alliance is sending out new signals calling for the gradual substitution of political confrontation for military confrontation. The industrial democracies are making a concerted effort to assist the Eastern countries in their difficult transition to pluralism and a market economy.
In North-South relations, too, the climate of sterile debates, ideological recriminations and illusions of self-sufficiency is slowly dissipating. We are pleased to see that the principle of integration has prevailed in the Final Document of the Non-Aligned Conference held at Belgrade. With the increasing renunciation of the use of force in international relations, the search for areas of complementarities and convergence is intensifying. We are emerging from a period of appallingly destructive and tragically pointless wars. Wars can no longer be won, as we have seen in the conflict between Iran and Iraq, which even now has not yet ended in a true and lasting peace. For one generation, at least, the memory of this senseless slaughter will be a further incentive for compromise. On the other hand, the increasing uselessness of military strength for purposes of prestige and domination has helped to start a promising trend towards growing cooperation among peoples. This will determine the success of the important negotiations on disarmament ranging from talks between the major Powers on the reduction of nuclear weapons to multilateral discussions on the total elimination of chemical weapons and on drastic cuts in offensive capabilities also in the field of conventional weapons. The substantial progress made in the latest US-USSR talks shows the validity of the goals which are also being pursued by Italy in Vienna and Geneva, where we expect conclusive results in the course of the next few months. The significant proposals announced to the Assembly by President Bush will help in this direction.
Integration is achieved through the exercise of freedom, democracy and pluralism - in essence, the rights first codified at the international level by the United Nations. Freedom, complementarity and solidarity must be the guiding principles of a new coexistence. Since the meeting in Vienna of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, it is harder to evade the obligation to respect fundamental freedoms by invoking national sovereignty, for verification measures are being perfected just as much in this area as in weapons control. Respect for human rights, among other considerations, makes the continued existence of such punishments as the death penalty unacceptable in our view. Italy is actively involved in efforts to facilitate the approval of the Second Optional Protocol on the abolition of the death penalty. Similarly, we feel it would be most appropriate to agree to a moratorium on the execution of death sentences already passed or of those pronounced during the next three years. Italy would also like to see the adoption of the international convention on the rights of the child.

The logic of integration is negated when countries import technology while ignoring the fact that economic progress and democracy are two sides of the same coin. And then there are cases where, on the pretext of alleged racial differences, unnatural segregation measures are imposed, and human beings are denied full recognition of their dignity, even though some changes in the right direction can be discerned, for example, in South Africa. In the Arab-Israeli conflict, each of the contending parties may be tempted to resolve the issue by disregarding the other side and its rights, so that the growing toll of bloodshed and violence could set back any hopes of peace for years and generations, whereas it is only through dialogue that Manichaean opposing views can be set aside. The latest proposals of President Mubarak have our full support, as they open up prospects for the future which, as they are not of unlimited duration, must be promptly utilized. We are dismayed at the danger of disintegration facing Lebanon, where the tangled web of animosities and extraneous involvements has thus far prevented the achievement of the necessary conditions for the restoration of order and justice. Unfortunately, in the Horn of Africa, Cyprus, Central America, Afghanistan and Cambodia, a general peace settlement remains an unattained objective, although to differing degrees.
Integration, in short, is lacking wherever there is a temptation to engage in protectionism and an unawareness of the fact that economic growth phenomena are inevitably interlinked, and that our general well-being will be substantially influenced, in years to come, by the way in which they interact. Integration must be sought gradually and pragmatically wherever and whenever it can be accomplished by suitable means. This is also the reason why Italy welcomes, promotes and supports regional groupings - the existing ones to which it belongs, and those still at the embryonic stage, yet full of promise, which we see emerging on all sides, including the other side of the Mediterranean Sea. The new trend towards forming regional associations, on a direct and immediate basis, without jeopardizing the equilibrium of States belonging to different international groups, should be welcomed. On our continent the formation of national States has partly submerged regional realities, but these will have to utilize Europe, and not just the Europe of the Community, as a space in which to regain their identity and ethnic and cultural diversity, without encouraging desegregation.
Public opinion in the Western countries perceives those ills that cross national boundaries - such as organized crime, drug trafficking, the spread of major infectious diseases and the destruction of the environment - as a threat to survival. Responsibility for co-ordinating action to combat evils that could affect the entire world lies primarily with the international organizations. The survival of our planet therefore calls for the strengthening of our multilateral institutions, for they help us to rid ourselves of ambitions and fears, to reorient our perception of danger and to decide on the reallocation of resources, which is especially important when we consider the amounts wasted on the arms race. As Lester Brown said, -To persist in investing in military security while ignoring social, economic and environmental needs is tantamount to destroying a. house in order to build a surrounding wall.'
The deterioration of the environment is a problem that transcends ideologies and differences in political systems. It is not just a specific consequence of an obsession with profits, but is also found where public opinion exerts insufficient influence and where technological backwardness damages nature in ways that have yet to be fully explored. The five warmest years of the century all occurred in this decade, and the Earth could not withstand the pressure that would result from extending traditional development to the two thirds of mankind that have not yet experienced it. All too often the impulse to destroy arises for the guest for immediate gains, possibly to meet schemed dates for the repayment of debts. The wealthier countries must sometimes choose between recovering a credit and giving up a vital dose of oxygen.
What can be done in a world that is changing so rapidly before our very eyes? Western Europe must continue its progress towards a new supranational identity. Many things depend, both within and outside our continent, on the success or failure of this revolutionary project. The success of this integration and of its extension to the Eastern countries in Europe will be crucial to the restoration of Europe's centrality after a long partial eclipse. The European Community is the result of a generous impulse to project well-being beyond national boundaries. It would not be true to its origins if it retreated into its shell to become a fortress of privilege, and if growth in its internal cohesion were accompanied by a distancing between the Twelve and the surging world. The European community, must make an effort, in the years to come, to identify new forms of cooperation including institutional co-operation, with countries that are too similar not to wish to join or, if dissimilar, too dependent not to want at least to be associated. It can avail itself of the means prided by article 238 of the Treaty of Rome, which seems to me to be particularly helpful for the extension of the co-operation effort to two regions. Central Europe and the southern shores of the Mediterranean.  Central Europe is the ideal place for the formation of political, economic and cultural ties in such a way as to smooth the path of continental integration and avoid any sudden changes too traumatic for a world in need of gradualism after the divisions of the past.
During this month of September, with its bitter anniversaries for Europe, it is significant that in Poland and Hungary, an omnipresent totalitarian power structure, in existence until just recently, should progressively make way for alternative methods of government based on Parliaments and the popular vote. The industrial democracies must give concrete proof of their readiness to contribute to the economic costs of this transition, even though there are other, even needier, cases elsewhere in the world deserving of their support. For its part, my country wishes to promote in Middle Europe a special co-operation effort between Italy, Yugoslavia, Austria and Hungary.
Nor can the European Community turn a blind  eye to its southern borders, where a gathering wave of malaise is threatening its less well endowed neighbours. By the end of this century the population on the southern shores of the Mediterranean sea win have increased by 60 million. If the Mediterranean is not to become an area of permanent instability. Europe and the African countries win have jointly to tackle the problems of trade, investment and immigration, with a view also to promoting sufficient development to root labour forces in their country of origin. We shall a11 have collectively to consider Europe's capacity to absorb poor and vulnerable foreign population, groups, to ensure that they do not end up facing a new marginalisation in our countries. Italy is already studying this question at the national level. It would be tragic to succumb to inertia in the face of the drug scourge. A long, hard war lies ahead, and the outcome is uncertain, we are fighting a faceless adversary, without uniform or frontiers, feeding a silent subterranean river of death.
We must study the circuits of international finance and reconstruct the routes used to recycle the proceeds from drugs, which now exceed earnings from the sale of weapons, and we must create an international legal arena in which the judiciary and the police can operate as they would in a single country. These objectives are laid down in the United Nations Convention of December 1988. which must enter into force without delay and be implemented in full.
In the meantime, we must help countries like Colombia, which, in order to uproot structures that threaten their sovereignty, have courageously decided to break the pattern of silence and complicity. Italy therefore undertakes to support the plan for a war on drugs, put forward recently by Prime Minister Manley of Jamaica. The plan provides not only for a series of measures in such areas as information, development and rehabilitation but for the creation, under United Nations auspices, of a multinational strike force to take action against drug trafficking organizations. It will also be necessary, of course, to remove the roots of the evil by providing farmers, particularly in Latin America, with the means of planting alternative crops. This applies particularly to Bolivia, Peru and Colombia. Italy is redirecting its own development co-operation, to which it is devoting increasing resources, in the light of the new forces threatening international public order. However, we feel that the resources of the United Nations in this field should be strengthened as well.
If human beings are not to be overwhelmed by the destructive forces of nature, we must be mindful of Bacon's maxim 'Nature is not governed except by obeying her', it is hard to follow this injunction after decades and even centuries of disobedience. But it would be unforgivable if environmental concerns were allowed to widen the gulf separating South and North. The Western countries, which have enjoyed the greatest production success in history, are calling for environmental measures without overlooking their own serious flaws. Nor are they unaware of the fears of the poorer countries concerning the impact of environmental measures on the pace of their own development, on their still elementary infrastructural levels and on the growth of consumption, if not their very survival.
Here, too, the logic of integration must be made to prevail by the joint elaboration of a code of conduct, possibly through an international authority responsible for drawing up and implementing a new law of the environment, an initiative already planned by the European community. Nowadays it is more necessary than ever to envisage the legal definition of a new kind of crime - crime against the natural environment. Italy is organizing an international forum on the international legal aspects of the environment to be held in Siena next spring. This. we hope, will help to make the world conference on the environment and development, to he held In 1992. a success and not an occasion for new disagreements. On the question of the environment. Italy particularly wishes to foster co-operation between the Mediterranean countries, under the relevant existing plan of action, and it is also planning with Yugoslavia a commons strategy for the Adriatic. No development is possible without eliminating, or at least reducing, indebtedness - an evil which overshadows so many economies and which in Latin America threatens to reactivate the recurring cycle of fragile democracies followed by harsh military dictatorships.
The Brady plan represents a political turning-point, but we must go further and reverse the unnatural flow of resources still -pouring into the richer nations from the poor countries. This flow amounted to 343 billion last year alone. Recent progress from mere debt management to debt reduction was made possible by various case-by case solutions. The conclusion of negotiations between certain countries and creditor banks confirms the merits of this strategy when reinforced by contributions from the financial institutions, whose resources must be increased to equip them for their new role.
Italy intends to show the consistency of its policy by taking a further step to help the poorest nations. It will immediately waive repayment of development loans amounting to some 32 billion and will in future conduct its co-operation with those com tries exclusively by means of grants. The problem of indebtedness must be dealt with in the framework of more active participation by the developing cowries in trade, especially as we are preparing, in the Uruguay Bound, to redesign structures for the exchange not only of goods, but also of investments, services and technology, to ensure that the poorest countries play a meaningful role in the International economy. with regard to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, we feel that institutional strengthening is necessary to give the organization a political dimension and enable all to participate in a multilateral trade system, following modalities that take account of different situations and levels of development. 
On the more general problem of development, I feel that the time is ripe for an exercise in reflection at the highest level, in the light of the many new developments of this decade. Further consideration should be given to a new North-South meeting, adequately structured and prepared, to initiate the political dialogue eagerly awaited by the emerging countries, on a realistic and constructive basis.  The new world is not just around the corner, but if we want to start building it today we must make the United Nations the chief instrument of global integration. The Organization enables us to develop a diplomacy for the prevention and settlement of political disputes as well as a common strategy for development. It must be reinforced both as an irreplaceable channel for mediation and as a valuable means of safeguarding agreements reached. With their ever-increasing commitments, the peace-keeping forces must be strengthened, not only by securing wider participation, but also by improving the machinery for the recruitment and employment of troops.
Particularly out of place in a world moving towards gradual integration are, in our opinion, such resolutions - adopted in a different climate - as the one equating Zionism with racism, we believe that that resolution should be rescinded. In United Nations bodies the influence of the southern hemisphere is sometimes felt, while in the financial institutions the counsels of the affluent world prevail, not without excessive resentment in the one case and excessive selfishness in the other. United Nations bodies would be better balanced if the Soviet Union were able to participate in international economic institutions. Also with this in view, the Western industrialized nations are contributing to reforms in that country to facilitate such participation. We also feel that an intensive dialogue in the framework of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development would help the Eastern countries towards a better understanding of the need for their progressive involvement in multilateral co-ordination.
An improved balance in the structures designed with such foresight just after the Second World War will enable the United Nations to perform its role as the prime mover in international integration. Perhaps the time has also come to reappraise the relevance of existing decision-making mechanisms, including voting procedures, to new conditions and responsibilities. The problems confronting us are too complex for us to believe any longer in miraculous solutions and instant formulas. Only a partial, persevering and gradual effort inspired by the principles I have only briefly outlined can ensure that our countries, in full awareness of the tasks awaiting them, have both the courage needed at this point in history to shoulder them fully and the ability to accomplish them.
","This will determine the success of the important negotiations on disarmament ranging from talks between the major Powers on the reduction of nuclear weapons to multilateral discussions on the total elimination of chemical weapons and on drastic cuts in offensive capabilities also in the field of conventional weapons. In the Arab-Israeli conflict, each of the contending parties may be tempted to resolve the issue by disregarding the other side and its rights, so that the growing toll of bloodshed and violence could set back any hopes of peace for years and generations, whereas it is only through dialogue that Manichaean opposing views can be set aside. Public opinion in the Western countries perceives those ills that cross national boundaries - such as organized crime, drug trafficking, the spread of major infectious diseases and the destruction of the environment - as a threat to survival. The survival of our planet therefore calls for the strengthening of our multilateral institutions, for they help us to rid ourselves of ambitions and fears, to reorient our perception of danger and to decide on the reallocation of resources, which is especially important when we consider the amounts wasted on the arms race. The problem of indebtedness must be dealt with in the framework of more active participation by the developing cowries in trade, especially as we are preparing, in the Uruguay Bound, to redesign structures for the exchange not only of goods, but also of investments, services and technology, to ensure that the poorest countries play a meaningful role in the International economy."

Mr. President, today I have the honour of addressing the General Assembly for the first time and I wish to extend greetings to you both personally and on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola and best wishes for your success during this forty-fourth session of the Assembly. We are certain that your abilities aid diplomatic experience will contribute significantly to its success.
We should like also to express our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, who conducted the previous session with brilliance and foresight, contributing, as we all know, to its success.
To the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, we extend our most sincere congratulations, especially on his exemplary performance in the process leading to the search for peace and prosperity for all mankind despite all the political, economic and other problems that the Organization faces.
Only a few days have elapsed since the ninth summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which was held in a spirit of modernization. That conference took place at a time when positive changes were occurring in international relations. This is a situation that pleases us because we can now say that the period of the cold war is over. The super-Powers seem to have established between themselves a relationship directed towards ending confrontation and leading to a gradual reduction and dismantling of their respective arsenals, including nuclear arms. 
These negotiations between the major world Powers on the limitation of arms and on disarmament should be encouraged and supported by every current of opinion in our countries and around the world, as the right to choose between war and world peace should not be restricted to one country or to a small group of countries.
Peace is the patrimony of all mankind, which must fight in a United bloc in order to preserve it. Peace is the indispensable and necessary condition for development and for the building of happiness aid well-being for all people. Peace, stability and security are inseparable, and since we live an interdependent world: Id the active commitment of all coin tries is necessary for the resolution of world problems.
The results reached at the Reykjavik talks opened important prospects for peace for peoples all over the world and emphasized an already strong tendency towards the relaxation of tension in international relations and for the use of dialogue and negotiation as a means to resolve differences, end conflicts and eliminate those points of tension that exist in many parts of the globe.
This new tendency has encouraged the peoples of Africa to engage in a courageous struggle for the liquidation of the last remnants of colonialism and racism. Aware of this reality, the South African regime, supported by some Western Powers, has engaged in armed aggression and acts of sabotage, combining direct action with the participation of mercenaries and puppet groups against the countries in the region, with the dual objective of thwarting the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa, under the respective guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWATO) and the African National Congress (ANC), their sole and legitimate representatives, and of destabilizing sovereign southern African countries in order to promote subversion and create conditions for the imposition of neo-colonial Governments submissive to the wishes of the Western Powers.
The Peopled Republic of Angola, as a country fighting to win the battle against underdevelopment at all costs in order to improve the social conditions and standards of living of its people  could not isolate itself from the political context of its region. Out contribution to the solution of the problems that affect the southern region of our continent has been provided within the context of the front-line countries  to which our country has given significant support in the political and diplomatic actions undertaken to find a just solution to the problem of the decolonisation of Namibia and the elimination of the vicious apartheid system. Because of this attitude  Angola has been the victim of constant armed aggression. 
This climate of extreme armed violence generated by the South African aggressors has resulted in remarkable deeds by the Angolans - such as the victorious battles of Cuito Canavale, Tchipa, Calueque and Ruacana -Â· which will remain as glorious pages in the history of our resistance against the invader. In this hard struggle the Angolan people was able to count on the active commitment of Cuba and on the support of the international community, for which we are most grateful.
The Government of the People's Republic of Angola has given proof of good faith and understanding in the search for the means to solve its internal conflict. In a constructive spirit, and as a clear demonstration of its peaceful policy, the Angolan Government on 22 June this year, in the presence of 18 African Heads of State at a meeting held at Gbadolite, in the Republic of Zaire, agreed upon a cessation of military hostilities, to become effective on 24 June 1989. That followed intensive consultations with various African countries regarding a series of principles that were included in the peace plan for Angola.
The President of the Republic of Zaire informed us that he had established contacts with Savimbi and UNITA and that they had accepted the principles for the settlement of the internal problem in Angola. Those principles areÂ·, first, cessation of external interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola. Secondly, cessation of hostilities in all parts of the national territory, including the area around the Benguela railway, which will be considered a peace zone, and therefore used only for peaceful protest thirdly, observation of the provisions of constitutional law aid other fundamental legislation; fourthly. Integration of UNITA militants into the structure of the State', and into other institutions, according to their capabilities; and, fifthly, acceptance of a temporary, voluntary removal of Jonas Savimbi from the Angolan political scene. 
Unfortunately, since the Gbadolite summit events have not proceeded at the same pace or developed positively, since the UNITA rebels have not stopped their terrorist acts or their hostile statements and propaganda against the legitimate Government of Angola. Moreover, their traditional allies have not ceased their interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola. It must be remembered that we are involved in a peace process, which is not promoted by the supply of arms and increased financial aid to Jonas Savintbi.
The fact that certain groups of Angolans serve as instruments for the realization of the Pretoria regime's aims in the war of aggression against Angola shows that the war against our country has an external origin. Therefore, we regret that despite all the commitments freely made by Angola - not only in the comprehensive negotiations platform of 17 November 1984, but also in the Geneva Protocol of 5 August 1988 and in the bilateral agreement between Angola and Cuba of 22 December 1988 on the withdrawal of the Cuban military contingent from the People's Republic of Angola - the UNITA rebels, in spite of the cease-fire agreed upon in Gbadolite, have carried out various attacks and ambushes. Up to the end of August there had been 2 85 attacks against the civilian population and the armed forces, 199 ambushes, 127 anti-personnel and mine explosions, the destruction of 58 personnel carriers by mine explosions, 67 abductions, 56 cases of looting, 1,226 deaths, 2,071 wounded, 705 disappeared, one Brazilian citizen wounded, one Filipino citizen assassinated, 135 houses destroyed, 263 cats destroyed and 1,107 head of cattle stolen.
That is the clearest evidence of the dangerous conduct of UNITA, which has thus proved to continue to be a destabilizing element, not only internally, in Angola, but also in the region as a whole.  Furthermore, the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has supported all those initiatives that would contribute, de facto, to the elimination of disagreement and war, in the interest of defending the inalienable rights of peoples to independence, sovereignty and the free choice of their political system.
Racist South Africa, playing the role of gendarme in our region, is economically destabilizing the front-line countries, and especially the People's Republics of Angola and Mozambique. The actions of the bandits paid by South Africa are aimed at ensuring the realization of those objectives, and have nothing to do with the interests of the Angolan people. For that reason, their preferred targets are the social and economic infrastructure and the villages of peaceful citizens, where the greatest barbarities are committed. 
Beating in mind the fundamental role played by the United Nations, the Government of Angola has been informing the Secretary-General, Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and the Member countries about the evolution of the situation in southern Africa in general and in particular in my own country. The Secretary-General's visits to Angola have made it possible for the highest representative of this international institution personally to witness the extent of foreign aggression and the reasons for out resort to the right of self-defence.
We have had the opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General our position regarding the origin of the conflict that has devastated our sub region and those responsible for it. My Government, within its already proven policy of flexibility and respect for the principles that govern relations between States, has presented serious proposals for the re-establishment of peace in southern Africa.
Ws believe that once the apartheid system in South Africa has been dismantled out region will enter a period of peace, necessary for the development aid progress of its peoples, which will be conducive to regional and international co-operation. Particularly with the independence of Namibia, which we all hope will be achieved within the schedule initially established.
The Angolan Government will not fail to make every effort in the search for a political solution to the problem of apartheid, through talks between the Government in Pretoria, the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other valid political forces in South Africa.
In fact, today the situation in Namibia presents a different scenario. With the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) an irreversible process was set in motion, beginning in April this year. We hope that it will bring an end to the last stronghold of colonialism on the African continent, despite the acts of intimidation against the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) militants and sympathizers by the Koevoet forces integrated into the South West Africa Police, which continue to carry out their activities, especially in northern Namibia. The Koevoet continues to employ tactics of counter-insurgency as well as destabilization in the south of Angola, in collaboration with the demobilized elements of the former territorial troops - the South West Africa Territory Force - especially battalions 54, 101, 201 and 202, which are stationed along the Angola-Namibia border aid which maintain close ties with UNITA, in a clear violation of the tripartite agreement.
The People's Republic of Angola reiterates its total commitment to complying with the New York agreements, as long as there is a corresponding compliance by the other patties aid the efforts made for Namibia's transition from colonialism to independence are made under conditions of stability and justice, lb this end, in accordance with the New York agreements regarding peace in south-west Africa; we should like to refer on the one hand to the more than 22,600 internationalists from Cuba who have already returned to their country and on the other hand to the SWAPO elements which ate new, as was agreed, north of parallel 16 and under the control of the United Nations representative in Angola. 
The efforts of the Secretary-General in search of a just negotiated solution to the conflict concerning Western Sahara have merited the encouragement of the Angolan Government. We hope the contacts between His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco and the POÅISARIO Front will continue opening the way for the implementation of the United Nations and Organization of African Unity resolutions on this matter.
A matter of equal importance to the people and the Government of Angola is that of the Maubere people, which has struggled for 14 years against the foreign occupation of its territory. We reaffirm once again our appreciation of the position taken by the Portuguese Government as administering Power of that Territory, and we urge the Secretary-General to make every effort in the search for a just and lasting solution based on the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Territory and relevant United Nations resolutions.
We must commend the efforts of the Korean people towards the peaceful reunification of their country, without foreign intervention based on dialogue and consultations between North and South, in compliance with the principles established in the Joint North-South Declaration of 4 July 1972.
We salute the positive developments towards resolution of the situation in Kampuchea, reflected in the actions of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in withdrawing its forces stationed in Kampuchea.
Following the April 1988 Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan, we called upon the signatories to fulfil their commitments with a view to establishing a climate of peace, security and stability in South-East Asia.
We encourage the Central American States to continue on the path they have chosen to find negotiated political solutions. We are convinced that the peace agreements recently concluded in Honduras will greatly contribute to the implementation of the Esquipulas II agreements. We reiterate our active solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people which under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization is waging a tenacious struggle for the liberation of its territory and for the establishment of an independent State comprising the entire territory of Palestine  including Jerusalem.
We support the efforts of the tripartite committee created by the League of Arab States to seek a negotiated political solution to the fratricidal conflict in Lebanon.
We are sure that sufficient change will take place to permit peace to be restored in all regions of the planet where war situations persist and to ensure that respect for the rights of peoples and States to freedom and independence will lead to a common path of economic and social development.
In speaking of the role played by the United Nations, one cannot overlook the highly positive contribution of the non-aligned countries and their Movement, which has greatly influenced action in favour of halting the arms race, reducing nuclear and conventional arsenals aid gradually easing pockets of regional tension.
We find ourselves at the end of yet another decade unfortunately characterized by deep stagnation with respect to the economic development of our countries. In some countries the economic situation is even worse than that of 20 years ago. Since the Common Fund for commodities, under the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, came into effect last June, a few successes have been achieved in the field of international trade. While these are not significant enough to efface the spectre of the weak results obtained, they encourage us in our long, hard-fought struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order.
It is for that reason that we want to reaffirm our total commitment to the holding next April of a special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation, and in particular on revitalizing economic growth and development, which will undoubtedly constitute an important step towards the adoption of a new international development strategy which we all hope will produce better results than previous ones.
As we again examine the current economic situation in our countries we ate compelled to express our great concern with respect to the worsening of the problems faced by the international financial system and the consequences for our countries' already weak economies. Huge loans, along with high interest rates and the unprecedented fall in commodity prices, have aggravated the problem of the foreign debt of developing countries, a problem which has placed those countries in such an absurd situation that they are today repaying more to the developed countries and international financial institutions that they receive in loans. In my view that situation cannot continue because it threatens the social, economic and even political feasibility of our existence as States. We therefore consider it timely and urgent that an international conference be held on financial and monetary questions for the solution of this crucial problem.
When we gathered recently in Belgrade at the latest summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, we recognized that increased South-South co-operation is vital as one way to ease the present economic crisis - not as an alternative to co-operation with the North, which is also a priority, but as a means of finding other solutions to this problem, a problem that faces us all and threatens the existence of all.
It is also paramount now to devote special attention to the African continent, where the critical economic situation of its States has reached unprecedented levels. Hunger, malnutrition, epidemic diseases and natural disasters have made any attempt at economic development impossible, to the point where 26 of the 36 least developed countries in the world are on the African continent. 
We deplore the weak commitment of the international community, which has made it impossible for the United Nations Programme of action for African Economic Recovery and Development to succeed despite the efforts made by African countries, in some case with enormous social sacrifices. Added to those factors is the enormous foreign debt the continent faces today, a debt that has already exceeded the astronomic sum of 3230 billion, forcing most African countries into a level of debt servicing that is incompatible with their development needs.
The increasing deterioration of the environment, the depletion of the ozone layer and, especially, the flow towards developing countries of toxic wastes 'exported' by developed countries have in recent years been the focus of attention by the international community. The People's Republic of Angola unconditionally condemns all such negative activities, which are incompatible with the already critical economic development of those countries. We stress the importance, indeed the urgency, of holding a second conference on environment and development, since we believe it would provide an ideal opportunity to deal jointly with these questions.
The People's Republic of Angola, located in the southern part of the African continent, unfortunately cannot escape the critical economic situation facing that continent. The People's Republic of Angola has recently joined the International Monetary Fund as a full member of that important international financial institution. We should like to take this opportunity to excess our deepest appreciation to all the countries which, though their contributions, made it possible for us to join. We do not deny the importance of joining the International Monetary Fund, particularly as this relates to the successful implementation of our economic and financial recovery programme, which we in the People's Republic of Angola have been implementing for several years. The economic recovery programme of our com try places priority on restructuring the foreign debt valued at 94,966 million, and on the rescheduling of the terms of repayment in order to re-establish the financial flow of exports and to make possible a global volume of trade compatible with the domestic levels of consumption and projected investments.
The programme concentrates equally on attracting foreign investment, which will be principally directed toward the export rather than the import sector, with a view to restoring production and increasing wages and the availability of consumer goods. The People's Republic of Angola is a country with enormous economic potential, and we trust that we can make further advances in those areas and in continued pursuit of better living conditions for our people.
In conclusion, we should like to take this opportunity to launch an appeal to the international community for at increase in its support and material aid to the programmes the People's Republic of Angola is implementing to counter the effects of the war that can still be felt in our country and losses that now exceed 912 billion. The emergency situation in the People's Republic of Angola has been rendered more acute by a drought in its southern region and floods in the north.
In that context, a conference on the emergency situation was held in Angola on 22 September, the positive results of which will be a symbolic contribution towards minimizing the difficulties affecting the sectors of public health and agriculture, which most urgently require supplementary assistance.
Allow me, Mr. President, to reiterate our best wishes for success in the proceedings of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly, end to assure you of the Angolan delegation's co-operation in any way that may be necessary. 
","Peace, stability and security are inseparable, and since we live an interdependent world: Id the active commitment of all coin tries is necessary for the resolution of world problems. Aware of this reality, the South African regime, supported by some Western Powers, has engaged in armed aggression and acts of sabotage, combining direct action with the participation of mercenaries and puppet groups against the countries in the region, with the dual objective of thwarting the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa, under the respective guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWATO) and the African National Congress (ANC), their sole and legitimate representatives, and of destabilizing sovereign southern African countries in order to promote subversion and create conditions for the imposition of neo-colonial Governments submissive to the wishes of the Western Powers.

44,1989,CRI,"ï»¿
I salute you, Sir, on behalf of the Costa Rican people and wish you all success as President of the General Assembly. I salute also a tireless friend in the efforts for peace in Central America and the world, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
As President of Costa Rica I came here for the first time in 1986. I said then that Central America was on the brink of war. I have returned today for the last time during my term of office to tell the Assembly that we are on the verge of peace. Yesterday I came to ask for your help and today I come to thank you. Then, we had to stop a war*, now we must build peace. How quickly the world has changed in these few years. Brother has stopped killing brother in many places on this Earth. I ask myself: Where are the winners of those wars? Where are the vanquished? Let us not be afraid to say it; the only winners were those who had the courage to a peace accord? the only winners were those who had the courage to change history. Wherever violence continues, everyone is the loser.
The line between war and peace is a difficult and treacherous path. It also bears witness to resentments that persist for many years. At times the decisions of the few, immersed in ideological dogmatism of religious fanaticism, are enough to tip the scale towards destruction and death. On other occasions, men in faraway places encourage armed conflicts, disregarding the pain of those who are dying. It takes very little to turn peace one day into violence the next. It is also true that individuals and peoples can make a difference in favour of peace. The strength of forgiveness and dialogue can silence the guns and put everyone to work towards finding real solutions. Our destiny is not carved in stone and it is our responsibility to fashion a different future.
There are many who are unsure whether to commit themselves to the path of dialogue and reconciliation for fear of being called naive. It is easier to say that wars will always exist and wash one's hands of it, as did the great traitors in the history of humankind who could have prevented murder but chose to remain silent, who could have stopped war but encouraged it, who could have fought poverty but chose to ignore it. I am not afraid to say that the war which threatened to spread in so many directions has turned into an opportunity to build peace. My people are proud of having contributed to that change. We will not be prisoners of our past, not even for the sake of caution, when perpetuating that past violates the rights of men and women, limits their freedom, allows poverty and leads to war. The solutions to the problems that have been besetting us for so many years require imagination and courage. Let there be change. Let everything change so that hope can bring peoples together on one unified path.
Even though hunger is increasing in the world and inequalities between rich and poor countries are widening, the scale between war and peace has tipped towards peace. The direction of history in the struggle between dictatorship and the people has tipped in favour of freedom and democracy. Violence has not lessened pain, but severely increased it. It has not resolved problems, but has created other, bigger ones. The risks involved in forging a different future are less than
the pain and evil that will result if we persist in following the past blindly, to begin by ending war is the right way, but if we cannot build peace immediately we will have lost everything before we wake up to reality.
The Central American Peace Plan continues to move forward. The presidential summit meetings in El Salvador and Honduras have strengthened our commitment to fight to end the violence and improve democracy. The armed struggle in Nicaragua has stopped and thousands upon thousands of young people in that country owe their lives to that courageous agreement. An electoral process has begun, and in February 1990 the people of Nicaragua will elect a new president and parliament. With the help of many and with international supervision, elections in our sister country will be fair and equal guarantees will be given to all alike. We must continue to foster the reconciliation of the people of Nicaragua  the return of those who are in exile; the silencing of the guns that are still being fired; the end to violence demanded by reason, mercy and the peace plan.
The next presidential summit will be held in December in Nicaragua. That will be an opportunity for us all to verify the progress made towards the free and democratic elections that the entire world hopes to see. Nothing at that meeting could contribute to peace more greatly than an agreement to reduce the Sandinista armed forces substantially. This demilitarisation is an indispensable prerequisite if we want to achieve peace in our region. Because I have these hopes and will work for them, I was not afraid to come here in the past and say that Sandino had been murdered anew, for his struggle for freedom had been betrayed. I say today that I believe there is hope for the people of Nicaragua to become reconciled in democracy and freedom so that Sandino will rise again for all of them and so that together they can continue to pursue the revolution for freedom in freedom.
This month in Costa Rica, representatives of the Government of El Salvador will meet with leaders of the guerrilla forces of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. The purpose of the meeting is to negotiate an end to the hostilities. With God's help they will be able to reach an agreement similar to that obtained by the people of Nicaragua in Sapoa for the sake of peace. All the brutality in El Salvador has not led to any solution. Let anyone in this room rise and say without hesitation, in the presence of the nations of the world, what problems were solved by encouraging and supporting violence in our tortured Central America. I ask all those who can help to contribute to putting an end to the senseless killing and destruction in El Salvador. We demand an end to a decade of pain that has yielded no gains and provided no future.
Once more, as we come closer to the cease-fire negotiations, the conflicts and acts of war which torment that sister country have increased. Those who think that by demonstrating greater destructive power they will gain an advantage in the dialogue are badly mistaken, fin increase in violence reveals desperation and confirms weakness. There is no longer any sympathy in the world for heroic acts that turn into cowardice, for honour where blood is spilled.
Honduras rightly asks that the Nicaraguan Contras established in its territory immediately put down their weapons and return home. In Guatemala a few lunatics have escalated their acts of violence. They too will find no sympathy in a world that will not again confuse courage with terrorism nor fanaticism with the struggle for freedom. The doors of democracy have been opened for Guatemala, and we can all contribute to widening them. To abandon this path is to miss the call of history for democracy in that beloved sister nation. In the past few years the balance in Central America has tipped in favour of freedom, democracy and peace. Much remains to be done. We are very far from achieving the political coexistence we seek for every country and for the region, but we are moving in the right direction.
Everyone from His Holiness Pope John Paul II to the United Nations agrees that development and peace are inseparable. In the lands surrounding my country they are proceeding on dangerously separate paths. All the countries of the region, apart from Costa Rica, have become poorer. It is urgent to reverse that trend.
We are not unaware that many wish to help us. Nor can we fail to mention that only very slowly and in very few instances have good intentions materialized into facts. We shall maintain confidence in the United Nations special plan of economic assistance for Central America adopted by the Assembly, in the San Jose accords, which reflect the co-operation of the European Economic Community, in the Sanford Commission, which promotes development programmes that rise above political differences, and in the Caribbean Basin initiative, which jives preferential treatment to our exports. We shall never give up hope, because without development our peace will not last. In a few years we have to reverse more than 100 years of injustice and oppression.
The anguish of war, the hopes we share for a true peace and our dreams of sustainable development do not remove us from the challenges facing all mankind. We have not distanced ourselves from the political, technological and economic changes of our times. We are not unaware of the fact that imminent ecological disasters have become as serious a threat as war and are a harbinger of death, suffering and hunger. We are neither an economic nor a military Power. Nor are we merely part of a problem. We are part of a solution; we are defenders of ideas; we aspire to be a moral force. This year we shall celebrate 100 years of democracy in Costa Rica, and we have already celebrated more than 40 years as a people without weapons. We see a world weary of violence, tired of poverty. We see a world desperately seeking change. In the division between those who take refuge in the past and those who assume the risks of constructing a different future, my people is on the road of the future.
In this scenario, in which ideological walls are tumbling down and what was the iron curtain is opening up, and in which the wire fences that imprisoned nations are being cut, we can look without fear at the promise of freedom. Confrontation has not helped us solve our most basic differences. On the contrary, it contributed to spreading selfishness, to permitting dogmatic and fanatical men to govern in respectability. We mistook arrogance for courage. We made heroes of those who merely spoke against the powerful and promised to see justice done with arms. We forgot to work towards solutions, to make a commitment with respect to the suffering of our peoples, to accept the primary responsibility for taking up the challenges facing us. No one can be unaware that we have an opportunity to make a different world, to surmount through co-operation an agenda common to all, nations rich and poor, nations old and young.
The struggle for human rights must now and forever be without boundaries - without boundaries, the task of promoting peace in order to banish violence in the solution of our problems; without boundaries, the condemnation of terrorist acts; without boundaries, the determination to strengthen and buttress democracies, for never in history have democratic Governments made war upon one another; without boundaries, the obligation to take account of environmental concerns in our development plans; without boundaries, the commitment to free our children from the drugs that are killing and destroying them; without boundaries, our efforts to ensure that no nuclear weapon will ever be launched again, so that gradually, by replacing feat with understanding, we can destroy those weapons; without
boundaries, the commitment to control and reduce conventional weapons, and the disarmament that has become possible in this new era must guarantee resources for development and not only for the conquest of space; without boundaries, our hope for markets free from protectionism, for fair prices for commodities and for equitable opportunities for the growth of all peoples. Let us make this closing decade of the twentieth century one of peace and bread for all the world.
Much remains to be done before we finish tearing down the walls that reflect: the dogmatism and hatred of the past. Much remains to be done before we can commit ourselves to a common agenda. Beyond those two concerns, the greatest risk is that we will raise even higher walls separating the rich nations from the poor, separating the North from the South, 'today, when a farmer who works in the lands and villages south of the Rio Grande crosses the border or the sea to enter a developed country, he gains 100 years of development for himself and 200 years for his children. In the past, millions came from Europe to the Americas in search of an opportunity to win the race against hunger, to open up horizons of freedom. Today we must ensure opportunities for balanced development for all nations and see to it that the walls that are torn down do not consolidate new alliances based on economic selfishness. If that happens, not only will the world's poor be the losers, but the rich too will find the ozone layer full of holes and their souls full of drugs. We must view the common agenda as a joint responsibility and share burdens and benefits without fear.
Certain countries and many people in various parts of the world refuse to co-operate in strengthening a new world. Matters remain that have not been settled, which causes an uncertainty that turns even the brave into cowards. It is of vital importance for us in Central America that the strict separation between East and West grow less rigid. If war is to end, it is crucial to abandon spheres of hegemony and make a commitment to work for freedom and democracy. For those who used to think that the only road to justice was the road of weaponry, the time has come to come down from the mountain and join the democratic process. I wrote the following the leader of the Soviet Unions
'I urge you once again, Mr. Gorbachev, to lay down arms in Central America. The young Russians who are dying today in Afghanistan have been punishment enough for a mistaken policy. They troops will return to the Soviet Union along the honourable path of courageously correcting one's mistakes. Correct also your policy towards Central America. let us also hold talks on eliminating conventional weapons, which today are killing our children and the children of the third world.'
The answer, although slow in coming compared with the speed with which our young people were dying daily in Central America, was positive. The Soviet Government agreed to work for peaceful understanding and to suspend all military aid.
It saddens me to report that shipments of weapons to the region continue. In Cuba, the leaders seem to have decided to remain in the Sierra Maestra and turn their back on the new world that is being born. I reiterate here my impassioned plea to all nations of the world to halt military assistance to the Central American region. As Cuba withdrew its soldiers from Angola, it must withdraw its support for armed opposition in the lands of Central America.
The problems that hinder our struggle for peace have been compounded by the threats and evil deeds of drug traffickers and by fears arising from the setbacks suffered by democracy in Panama. In Costa Rica, we approved, with the unanimous vote of our legislative assembly one of the strictest laws ever enacted to fight drug trafficking aid all commerce related to it. We are fighting and we will fight on, without faltering, for that objective, because our homeland will never provide refuge or respite for these criminals. It must be part of our commitment to peace and to a common world agenda, that Central America become drug-free. Our countries must not be tainted by drug production and trafficking.
We have given our total support to President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia, to whom, in a letter written on behalf of the people of Costa Rica I have said:
'When one is faced with such a difficult and crucial challenge, one cannot compromise. There can be no agreement with those who threaten everyone and everything with savage violence and disrespect our most sacred values. International solidarity is a categorical imperative. We cannot become accomplices, with a minute of silence or a minute of fear. You must triumph - for the greatness of your people and the dignity of the Americas.' I repeat here that in the noble struggle of President Barco Vargas, each and every one of us is a foot soldier.
I shall never tire of repeating that the alliance for freedom and democracy in the Americas, for which I called on the day I took office as President of Costa Rica, is our only hope for a lasting peace and strengthening of the foundations of economic development. There are still authoritarian Governments in Latin America, however, and that threatens our coexistence.
In Panama, our neighbour and sister nation, the path of oppression has also become the road of impoverishment. The sooner the Panamanians themselves can solve their problems through free elections, the lesser will be the tragedy that people endures. In Panama, principles of the supranational courses of the new world agenda have been violated - principles that protect human rights and support democracy, that combat corruption and circumscribe freedoms.
The mandate of my people is to support the moral force of which the people of Costa Rica are proud in international affairs also. We therefore denounce violence and work for peace. We denounce dictatorship and work for democracy. We denounce corruption and work for honesty. At the beginning of my presidency, I broke diplomatic relations with the Government of South Africa because we cannot sustain a dialogue with those who are capable of segregating their brothers because of the colour of their skin. We have withdrawn our Ambassador to Panama for as long as the path of liberty and democracy for all Panamanians is not respected.
International politics must not fall prey to cynicism. To state publicly the intention to pursue a certain course of action and then privately to push in the opposite direction is often the destructive practice of strong and respected Governments as well as of small nations. This behaviour undermines the trust we wish to build and we must fight it, forcing international political forums to be accountable to the people.
The will of the majority is beginning to prevail. Dialogue has regained its strength as a way to find solutions to the most difficult conflicts that confront us. The best proof of this is the United Nations, which in recent years has again begun to shine as a centre of international diplomacy and whose voice increasingly has the authority of the majority who break the chains which bound it to the extremes of power. Politics cannot consist of manipulating our fears, nor of the art of exaggerating our differences: we can respect it only when its purpose is to achieve harmony.
Nothing could be more advantageous for mankind than reading history together. Let us attain justice by sharing the errors of the past and by working with confidence towards solutions within the framework of a new agenda for peace and development. The time has come to pay with interest for yesterday's errors and failures so that the sincere co-operation we need may arise, so that a common agenda may become a reality. There is an ecological debt that the developed world has toward future generations. Perhaps we should offset it with the financial debt of the third world. There is a social debt that is reflected in the poverty of millions. Perhaps we should offset it by opening and freeing the markets.
Once world peace has been secured, a greater effort must be made to attain harmony in two respects; ecological balance and equitable development for nations and peoples. As with so many things in life, it is easier to share ideals than to reach them. We have different ways of determining how ecological imbalances and injustices have come about. Through dialogue, we can find agreement.
Acid rain damages relations among the industrialized countries, but the lack of drinking water for millions of men, women and children is perhaps an even greater challenge. We are justifiably concerned about the possible consequences of the gradual global warming of the Earth. We know that one answer is massive reforestation of the tropical countries. The destruction of the ozone layer creates new risks for new forms of life on the planet. The technologies needed to face these challenges are based on patents so expensive they are un-affordable in our countries. We know that the extinction of different biological species must be stopped, and therefore certain practices that exist in our countries must be changed. We must also penalize the improper use of certain products by the developed countries. It is necessary to stop the loss of the forests, but soil erosion must not be neglected either.
Each time we are disrespectful of nature, we are pointing a deadly weapon at our Children. No one must impose his solution on others, but together we can find a way that respects the goal that we pursue and is suited to what each of us can do. The economic crisis and the environmental threat are now part and parcel of the same problem. The economics of waste in the North and the economics of survival in the South are poor models for development. It is now time to construct a new harmony, to aim again at achieving well-being for every people and equitable development with justice and appropriate conservation of nature.
When I came here for the first time, which seems so long ago now because of all the things that have happened since, I enthusiastically said that I proposed to come back here within four years, when my presidential term of office had ended, to tell you that together we had brought peace to Central America and that shanty-towns had become a thing of the past. Today I am here to tell you that shanty-towns still exist in my country. We have built more housing than ever before, much more than I promised in my electoral campaign. We have launched a crusade that no Government will ever be able to reverse in the future. But the shanty-towns still exist, as does the child abandoned in the street. We have extended peace, but the threat of war persists, and brothers are still killing each other in the corners of my little America.
There is no end to the struggle for justice and peace. It does not know a single day of rest. Some short-sighted people believe that the efforts to eliminate the slums in my country could have been more effective if we had not fought for peace. I thank God and Costa Rica that we never fell into that selfish way of thinking. My people can look back at the history of the last few years with their heads held high.
As I said to you at the beginning of my statement, I came to thank you because the successes we have attained would not have been possible without your help. You are giving a human face to a world that until recently had no face and knew no mercy. I leave with the joy of knowing that peace is closer at hand and with the confidence of knowing that the slums which still darken the horizon in my country will disappear. I will always continue to he a Costa Rican at the service of these causes and your ally in these struggles the world over.
","The anguish of war, the hopes we share for a true peace and our dreams of sustainable development do not remove us from the challenges facing all mankind. The struggle for human rights must now and forever be without boundaries - without boundaries, the task of promoting peace in order to banish violence in the solution of our problems; without boundaries, the condemnation of terrorist acts; without boundaries, the determination to strengthen and buttress democracies, for never in history have democratic Governments made war upon one another; without boundaries, the obligation to take account of environmental concerns in our development plans; without boundaries, the commitment to free our children from the drugs that are killing and destroying them; without boundaries, our efforts to ensure that no nuclear weapon will ever be launched again, so that gradually, by replacing feat with understanding, we can destroy those weapons; without
boundaries, the commitment to control and reduce conventional weapons, and the disarmament that has become possible in this new era must guarantee resources for development and not only for the conquest of space; without boundaries, our hope for markets free from protectionism, for fair prices for commodities and for equitable opportunities for the growth of all peoples. Beyond those two concerns, the greatest risk is that we will raise even higher walls separating the rich nations from the poor, separating the North from the South, 'today, when a farmer who works in the lands and villages south of the Rio Grande crosses the border or the sea to enter a developed country, he gains 100 years of development for himself and 200 years for his children. Once world peace has been secured, a greater effort must be made to attain harmony in two respects; ecological balance and equitable development for nations and peoples. When I came here for the first time, which seems so long ago now because of all the things that have happened since, I enthusiastically said that I proposed to come back here within four years, when my presidential term of office had ended, to tell you that together we had brought peace to Central America and that shanty-towns had become a thing of the past."
44,1989,CSK,"ï»¿May I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly and express my conviction that under your guidance the current deliberations of the General Assembly will bring fruitful results.
In our contradictory and complex world hope for peaceful restructuring of relations between States, for their democratisation, demilitarisation and humanization has grown ever stronger in recent times. We would like to believe that, after decades encumbered by prejudice, tension aid confrontation, a new period is emerging during which contentious problems will be solved exclusively by political means, by a dialogue in the interests of the further strengthening of co-operation and understanding between nations.
On the path to this better world the united Nations has its unique place. We value its active participation in the positive changes in present-day developments as  ell as the important role played in this regard by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.
The experience of the last two years has shown how necessary it is to develop the functions of the united Nations in the prevention of international disputes aid crises. The strengthening of this preventive role of the Organization constitutes a realistic way to a further increase in its effectiveness in the preservation of peace and security. The significant and inspiring proposals which could be heard in this context in Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev's statement here last year are no less topical new than they were then. We support them and contribute to their implementation.
In the present nuclear and space age it is necessary more than ever before to build international relations on deeply moral and ethical principles. In the year of the bicentennial of the great French revolution, whose heritage was followed up and significantly enriched by the great October socialist revolution in Russia, we recall not only the ideals of the enlightenment but also the humanistic message of the followers of the great achievement of the liberation of man - the message of those who could see in the horizon of tomorrow an international community where the simple laws of morality and justice by which mutual relations among people were to be guided would become the highest laws applying to nations.
Certain significant aspects of present-day developments encourage us to hope that these noble ideas will become a reality. It has been possible to improve the international climate and diminish the risk of a nuclear war. 'today we see traditional mistrust and suspicion receding. The first concrete results have been achieved in the field of nuclear disarmament. There is an ever-greater understanding of the need to proceed jointly with the solution of crucial global problems facing mankind. New impetus in this regard has been provided by the recent Soviet Union-United States talks in Wyoming. There has been an increase in the role of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The conclusions of its Ninth Conference, in Belgrade, are an important contribution to the peaceful development of international relations. If human civilization is to survive in the conditions of the threat of nuclear catastrophe, and given the ever-greater interconnection and mutual dependence of States regardless of their political systems, all countries must take new attitudes and non-traditional approaches stemming from the priority of universal human values and from the philosophy of the new political thinking.
We are optimists? yet we look upon the international situation realistically. It remains complicated. Not all are already capable now of accepting the notion of a world free from nuclear weapons and of violence. Confrontational approaches still persist, efforts are still being made to justify the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, and elements of pressure and attempts to teach lessons to others still linger on.
Political, military, economic, environmental and humanitarian problems are so interrelated today that we can solve them only by acting jointly and in a comprehensive way. Therefore, Czechoslovakia has co-sponsored the initiative of the socialist countries aimed at the achievement of a comprehensive approach to the issues of international peace and security. Only common security serves the interests of all; Disarmament, development and the environment are becoming its organic components. It is strengthened by comprehensive co-operation between States in the political sphere, in the economy, in culture, science and technology, as well as in the development of human contacts and in the field of human rights. At the same time, we proceed from the premise of strict observance of the united Nations Charter, of the Helsinki Final Act and of other international norms.
At the very inception of the united Nations there was imprinted on its banner a belief in the need to build a world order on the firm foundations of legality and justice. The process of codification and progressive development of international law over the past four decades has been unprecedented in history. However, has it really become an effective tool for regulating the behaviour of States and relations among them? A huge and daunting challenge still faces us - the need to strengthen the role of international law and develop the international machinery for its implementation.
The attainment of these goals could be significantly facilitated by the decade of international law proposed by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The broader use of the functions of the International Court of Justice is also a significant factor. We intend to add further to the almost 20 multilateral treaties on which Czechoslovakia has already accepted the jurisdiction of the Court. Czechoslovakia was one of the first victims of the expansionism of German fascism that unleashed the Second World War 50 years ago. We have drawn a lesson of the greatest importance from this most terrible tragedy in human history. Any attempt to change the post-war order on the European continent or to call into question the existing political and territorial realities would be incompatible with the Helsinki Final Act and would threaten dangerous consequences for peace and stability in Europe, end not only in Europe. Only by our combined efforts can we prevent a recurrence of the horrors of war.
The European continent has an important role to play in efforts towards a peaceful world order. It is in that part of the world that the two largest military aid political groupings and two of the most important integrating in ions are situated. Developments there are moving towards the strengthening of the favourable trends in international relations. The Vienna final document, the establishment of relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community, the negotiations on conventional forces and on confidence-building measures, the dialogue in the framework of the humanitarian dimension of the Helsinki process - all demonstrate the great opportunities for co-operation among the European States. The great Czech humanist Jan Amos Comenius, the 400th anniversary of whose birth will be commemorated in 1992, wrote; 'The best proof of human grandeur is the work of man's hands, of man's brain. As soon as this is understood by the leaders of nations, there will be no more wars'. We feel sure that the time for this understanding has already come. We believe that the inhabitants of our old continent will be able to make of it a common home based on a diversity of socio-economic systems and on respect for existing territorial and political realities and for sovereignty and the right of each nation freely to decide its own destiny.
Such a development requires, first of all, a reduction of conventional armed forces from the Atlantic to the Urals; the gradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction; the strengthening of the political functions of the Warsaw Treaty aid the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)   and enhancement of general trust and confidence an the continent. This is clearly expressed in the conclusions adapted earlier this year at the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty in Bucharest.
We seek to ensure that the military potential of the countries members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) is commensurate with the need of reasonable sufficiency and that their armed forces have an exclusively defensive nature. The proposals of the Warsaw Treaty and 'die reciprocal steps taken by the NATO States are a suitable basis for further negotiations in Vienna. We believe that if the will is there on both sides, an initial agreement could be signed at the highest level as early as next year.
There is an urgent need for the opening of separate talks an tactical nuclear weapons. This should involve a phased solution in which it would be the goal, in the first phase of the talks, to reach an agreement on redactions to equal, collective limits on both sides. In this context, we would recall the proposal put forward in April 1987 by the Governments of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic aid the German Democratic Republic to create a nuclear-weapon-free corridor in central Europe. Like the other Warsaw Treaty States, we have also adopted extensive unilateral measures to reduce the manpower of combat units by 12,000 men, end we are taking out of service and dismantling 850 tanks, 165 armoured personnel carriers and 51 military aircraft. This year we are reducing the production of combat equipment by 16 per cent. Next year the reduction will already have readied 25 per cent* and this process will continue. We are cutting defence expenditure in 1989-1990 by 15 per cent. We are also contemplating reducing the length of effective military service.
In the interests of enhancing confidence and security, we are ready to expand the Stockholm accords ad adapt, on a mutual basis, a new generation of information, observation and limitation measures applying to all branches of the armed forces. Our concrete contribution towards a more secure and peaceful world and construction of a comma European home is the initiative to create a zone of confidence, co-operation and good-neighbourly relations along the line of contact between the Warsaw Treaty ad NATO, put forward by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Milos Jakes. We wish to support the new trends in relations between the two military-political groupings and to seek out and utilize everything that unites us.
In the political sphere, we propose a regular ad all-road dialogue between parliaments, Governments, political parties, social organizations ad n on-governmental institutions. We are also working towards the adoption of measures designed further to strengthen confidence beyond the framework of the Stockholm document, for example by 'diluting' the contingents of forces deployed in the proposed zone. We also wish to promote the dynamic development of economic relations ad the creation of the prerequisites for new forms of co-operation. We are also paying a great deal of attention to the ecological part of the initiative. We strive for the creation of a system ad mechanism for multilateral co-operation in mutual assistance to preserve the quality of the air, water and natural riches we share with our neighbours. In the humanitarian sphere also, we wish to create favourable conditions for mutual knowledge and understanding.
It is true that this proposal is addressed not only to the countries along the line of contact between the two groupings. The participation of other States, including the neutral States, could add to its significance. Thus, there is an opportunity to make headway in shaping qualitatively new relations, thus contributing to a further improvement of the atmosphere in Europe.
In our policy, we proceed from the assumption that disarmament is one of the priority tasks of the present epoch. After the achievement of the treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate -Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, in which Czechoslovakia also played its part, the world breathed a sigh of relief. However, a large number of resolute steps still retrain to be taken to make the disarmament process irreversible. Above all, the negotiations on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive weapons must be successfully completed. We also assume that the anti-ballistic missile Treaty of 1972 must be complied with as signed.
The progress made in the talks between the Soviet Union end the united States on the limitation and halting of nuclear-weapon testing, about which we were informed from this rostrum, creates good conditions for resolving this key issue. We appreciate the readiness of the USSR to resume its moratorium on nuclear-weapon testing, and hope that the United States will respond positively. The need remains imperative to consolidate the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That goal would be promoted by the halting and eventual prohibition of the production of fissionable materials for armament purposes, as well as by the prevention of the spread of combat missile technology. A strengthening of the regime of this Treaty would be significantly facilitated by observance of the existing nuclear-free zones and by the establishment of new such zones. Reliable protection of civilian nuclear facilities from attack remains an important task.
Special attention should be focused on the achievement of a convention on a complete and general prohibition of chemical weapons and on the elimination of the stockpiles of such weapons, as called for by the Paris Conference held this year and by the recent Canberra negotiations. We welcome the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States made proposals from this podium a few days ago, the implementation of which would signal an important move towards the elimination of those barbarous weapons.
This year, Czechoslovakia has made increased efforts in pursuit of that goal, as further manifested by the corresponding statement of the Czechoslovak Government of last January. We have conducted a national experiment on the verification of the non-production of chemical weapons in the Czechoslovak civilian industry, we have also prepared an international stage for that experiment. We have reaffirmed that our country does not possess chemical weapons and that no such weapons are deployed in its territory, and we have made public the necessary data on our chemical industry in August. Our proposals of 1985 to 1988 for the establishment of a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, which could facilitate in its own way the conclusion of a global convention, retain their significance.
He also advocate speedy negotiations on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and on the programme of practical actions for the peaceful uses of outer space. The time has undeniably come to work out an international system of verification of the non- stationing of weapons in outer space and to set up a world space-monitoring agency.
He are in favour of a concrete consideration of the 'open skies' proposal, which we regard as one way to further develop confidence- and security-building measures. If supplemented with open lands, open seas and open space, the proposal could lead to the creation of a global system of comprehensive openness.
One of the first positive results of the process of genuine disarmament is also the gradual conversion of a portion of military production to civilian purposes. As for us, we have worked out a national plan for the utilization of the capacities released from the production of combat equipment. We support the idea that this matter should become a subject of international consultations, including in the united Nations.
The peaceful settlement of disputes by political means on a just basis is an essential condition for safeguarding peace, security and fruitful co-operation in the world. We believe that further progress can be made on the elimination of long-standing hotbeds of tension. Experience has shown that the united Nations can make a significant contribution in that regard.
Through the signing of agreements in New York last December, real prerequisites were created for a solution to the conflict in southern Africa. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has also delegated its observers to the united Nations Angola Verification Mission corps in Angola and to the united Nations Transition Assistance Group peace force in Namibia. In that way we have also demonstrated our full support for Namibia's transition to independence. The international community's pressure on South Africa must not abate. An appropriate added opportunity for that will certainly be provided by the special session of the General Assembly scheduled for December. Apartheid must be eradicated.
We appreciate the part played so far by the United Nations in mediating the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan. However, it is necessary of course that the other provisions of those Agreements also be implemented after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and that favourable conditions be thus created for a political solution of the situation and for a policy of national reconciliation. The United Nations should play an active role here. We fully support the proposals of the Afghan Government aimed at securing those objectives.
The complex situation in the Middle East requires the speedy convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices. That need has also been confirmed by the course of the general debate to date. The key to a solution of the conflict lies in the recognition of a balance of interests, respect for the legitimate rights of all participants and for their free choice of development. The uprising in the occupied territories is graphic proof of the will of the Palestinian people, which can no longer be ignored. The realistic policies espoused by the Palestine Liberation Organization have our broad support.
We express our hope that a final, peaceful aid just solution to the Iran-Iraq conflict will be found.
An important step towards a settlement of the Cambodian question is the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces. We support the policy of national reconciliation, which will create the basis for an independent, neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. A resumption of the negotiations in Paris on a peaceful future for that country should be instrumental.
We fully support the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to open a constructive North-South dialogue to strengthen understanding and peace in the Korean Peninsula.
We welcome the initiatives of the five Central American countries aimed at a peaceful solution of the situation in that area. We wish to commend in particular the constructive policy of the Government of Nicaragua. We view the full implementation of the Tela agreements and the engagement of the United Nations as a path to the settlement of the problem.
A further expression of Czechoslovakia's active support of a peaceful solution of the question of Cyprus by negotiation between the two communities was provided by the meeting of the principle representatives of eight Cypriot political parties in Prague in May. We welcome the negotiations between the countries of the Horn of Africa as well as Ethiopia's new initiative concerning the peaceful development of that country.
We have embarked upon the path of profound social transformations in my country. We are implementing the restructuring end democratisation of all walks of life in our society, with the aim of further strengthening and improving socialism and of taking full advantage of its humanistic potential. In that process, we are drawing on the experience of the USSR and other socialist countries. We have set ourselves the demanding task of restructuring society in all its complexity without damaging social and economic stability.
What we are aiming at is a truly just, economically efficient society with its economy based on advanced science and technology, a society with a high standard of living, firm social securities, and a deeply democratic political system enabling all citizens to develop their individual capabilities in harmony with the interests of society. We assume that socialism is based on the vigorous, creative activity of people. The restructuring builds on what we have achieved in the past, on the progressive and democratic traditions of the people of our country. It rests on our bonds of alliance end seeks to strengthen confidence aid co-operation, not only with our neighbours but also with other States.
The changes taking place in the socialist countries are generating favourable conditions for an increase in international co-operation to a qualitatively new level. That fully applies, too, to international economic relations, the further development of which should be founded on a consistently equal platform, on the principles of non-discrimination aid mutual advantage.
The present state of affairs is far from positive. Many serious problems exist in the world economy, and some of them are worsening. Imbalances and uncertainty about future development persist. There is an ever-widening gap between advanced and developing States. The indebtedness of the developing world is now reaching a critical point.
The United Nations can be of significant help in alleviating and solving those crucial problems. The favourable political climate should be concretely reflected in international economic relations also. Here, an important role will be played by the special session of the General Assembly, to be held in April of next year, as well as by the United Nations international development strategy for the coming decade. For our part, we are prepared to take all necessary steps.
International economic relations and scientific and technological co-operation can be enhanced only if all forms of pressure, exploitation aid discrimination are removed. That is the path towards greater security in such relations. The strengthening of the functions of the United Nations so that it might be possible to foresee and prevent emergency situations in world economic development would greatly facilitate that.
We shall continue to pay constant attention to economic relations with developing countries on the basis of equality and mutual advantage. With regard to our aid to those countries, it exceeds 1 per cent of our national income.
One of the most pressing global problems in today's world is the protection of the environment. Nature and human wisdom must be in harmony. That can be achieved only through the broadest possible joint action by all. We are determined to take an active part in those endeavours on the world, regional and sub-regional levels.
Indeed, at the forty-third session of the General Assembly we submitted, together with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a draft resolution in the field of protection of the environment. The proposal we have prepared for submission at this session, which deals with strengthening co-operation in the fields of monitoring, evaluating and anticipating dangers to the environment end with assistance in case of emergencies, incorporates the results of consultations held with many countries. It is based on the fact that there is a growing awareness of the real risk of unpredictable environmental situations that may not oily jeopardize the security of individual countries but also threaten the very existence of mankind. The preparation of a set of principles to govern the ecological behaviour of States should be an important contribution of the second United Nations conference on environment and development, to be held in 1992. We fully support the convening of that conference.
The solution of environmental questions is the aim of the proposal made by the Czechoslovak Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec. On that basis a conference was held at Prague this year of Government representatives responsible for environmental questions in Czechoslovakia and in all six neighbouring countries. It was also attended by representatives of the European Community, the Economic Commission for Europe end the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. In the memorandum adopted principles were laid down for action to be taken to strengthen international co-operation, which the participants in the conference intend to specify further. In due course we should like to hold a meeting in our capital city of the Prime Ministers of the participating countries. We also expect the forthcoming Sofia meeting on protection of the environment to achieve concrete results and help develop sorely needed co-operation in Europe.
In recent years joint efforts have made it possible to take a number of concrete steps away from confrontation and towards dialogue in the extensive sphere of humanitarian questions and human rights. The growing United Nations role in this connection is also confirmed by the draft convention on the rights of the child, which is now being prepared. The current session of the General assembly should bring that important initiative of the Polish People's Republic to a successful conclusion.
The position and place of man in society are increasingly becoming the central focus of world attention. The pan-Europe process has introduced a new notion - the human dimension - into international practice. It is our view that its implementation must gradually be given a universal character.
The struggle against drugs and narcotics is becoming critical, and we are prepared to contribute actively to it.
Within the framework of adopting practical and effective measures to prevent international terrorism, Czechoslovakia, together with Great Britain, has put forward an initiative in the United Nations and in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to prepare an international convention on the prevention of misuse of plastic explosives for terrorist purposes. We are pleased with the support given that idea by the Security Council, the Council of ICAO and many member States this year. We are ready to work together with all countries towards the earliest possible achievement of concrete results.
We are all faced with a need to solve difficult problems. Many processes that existed only on a national level not so long ago now have an international scope. They influence the life of each individual country and of the entire international community. If we can control those processes properly we can ensure, in real terms, not only the survival but also the prosperity of mankind. The united Nations plays an irreplaceable role in stimulating and co-ordinating those efforts. We must grasp the chance being offered us by the positive changes that are taking place in today's world and by the growing understanding of the human relationship.
We are convinced that the united Nations will fulfil its historic mission. In order for it to do so, however, there must be business-like and constructive dialogue aid, above all, political will on the part of Member States to make active use of all the opportunities the Organization offers. Let us therefore avoid confrontation and fruitless disputes here. Let us be even more consistent in identifying the things that link us together rather than the things that divide us. Let us concentrate on the solution of problems affecting the life and well-being of all. Just as States now possess the means of mutual extermination, so too do they have available to them sufficient potential to realize the universally valid ideas of peace, understanding and co-operation.

Czechoslovakia is ready to exert every effort so that we may be able, all together, to rise to this unique opportunity for the benefit of all mankind.

Burkina Paso and Nigeria on joy fraternal and friendly relations. Therefore it is with some pride and pleasure that we see as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session a son of Africa whose experience, personality and qualities are well known in the United Nations.
To his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, we would like to convey our appreciation for the way in which he performed his functions. The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organisation, as usual, has provided us with a complete overview of the state of the world and of the efforts made by our Organization. Mr. de Cuellar's patience, tireless activity and quiet determination have made it possible for the Organization to go through periods of great uncertainty until we have now reached a time when recognition off the need for our Organization has once again become unanimous.
'On the strength of this, I venture to hope that at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly the last guns will have been silenced on the last battlefields of the world, the Palestinians will be back in their land building a future together with the Israelis, the state of emergency will have been lifted in South Africa, Nelson Mandela will have been released from the apartheid gaol and, finally, Namibia will occupy in this Hall, somewhere between Mozambique and Nepal, the place that has been its right for so long, and for which it has waited far too long|.' (A/43/FV.7, p. 64)
these words which X have just quoted were the final paragraph of Burkina Peso statement in the general debate at the forty-third session.
Thee implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has gone through  lassitude and it is our hope that the present stage will see all parties keep : their commitment and make it possible for the provisions of the Security Council resolution to be applied fully and in their entirety. The Namibian peoples right to self-determination should be exercised in justice and democracy. We would also like to express again our confidence in the Secretary-General in the delicate ask that is his of ensuring that the process initiated will not be blocked by manoeuvres and diversionary tactics. It is being said and what has been done by the South African authorities do not o m to indicate that this ignominy of the present time, apartheid, has been attained at its root by its supporters. We cannot speak of any changes or improvement when Nelson Mandela and his companions remain in prison, when the movements that are demanding freedom are systematically restrained  when political parties and democratic movements are suspended, when the state of emergency is still in force, and when there is no sign of the beginnings of any real, consistent or detailed dialogue aimed at resolving the problem.
The fact that the international community has made the apartheid regime anathema has not yet brought it down. Nevertheless, the struggles and sacrifices of the South African people have induced the racist authorities to restrain their language and to come up with offers which could be expected to be confirmed subsequently by the simple dismantling of the apartheid regime. The recent elections in which more than 70 per cent of the population was excluded and the refusal of the racist authorities to recognize the democratic principle of 'one man one vote' are not in keeping with the bland reassurances of President De Klerk.
The racist regime of Pretoria thus continues to pursue its policy of apartheid and destabilization of the front-line states, and the international community expects more than a chance in style and language. It expects feat men have their dignity restored to them.
The right of peoples is also being violated in the territories occupied by Israel. The right of fee Palestinian people to self-determination is ignored by Israel, The intifadah has been the bold and resolute response of a people which is determined to regain its inalienable and undeniable rights. Oppression and repression are the twin sinister companions which are no longer able to stifle the powerful cry for sovereignty and freedom of a people which has been gagged and trampled underfoot.
It must be regretted that Israel is locked in its conviction that concessions are due it, that Israel refuses to admit the increasingly incontrovertible reality that the Palestinian people do exist, that Palestine exists and that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the authentic representative of fee Palestinian people.
Hitherto, important decisions have been taken by the Palestinian side without any positive Israeli reaction having been recorded. The Israeli authorities have stated that there will be no elections so long as the intifadah continues, that Jewish colonies will continue to be installed in fee occupied territories and that there will be no peace except under those conditions and only with those with whom they choose to speak. None of this is likely to restore peace to fee region.
That is not the logical path to take, and on 6 October last the General Assembly confirmed this once again When it demanded that Israel fulfil its obligations.
Just as apartheid has set southern Africa ablaze, Israel's policy as cause, effect and pretext has turned Lebanon into a victim on its last gasp. A country, a people, and a nation ace disintegrating. Burkina Faso supports the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League to promote dialogue and the search for peace. We hope that peace will come to the Middle East, through the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned, in particular Palestine. regional conflicts we hops will be resolved continue to cause concern in the international community.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, pursuant to the Geneva Agreements, has withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan more than six months ago. Burkina Faso supports all efforts to safeguard the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, as well as the unity of its people.
We appeal to Iran end Iraq to take the necessary action in order to ensure the complete implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1967).
It was not possible to conclude en agreement at the Paris Conference on Cambodia, but we may still entertain some hope since the Conference is scheduled to resume at the beginning of 1990. The withdrawal of foreign troops should lead to dialogue among all the parties to the conflict, the only ones likely to arrive at the necessary compromises for a return to peace and the non-aligned status of Kampuchea. Similarly, in Central America we urge respect for the Esquipulas II agreements, so that the peoples of the region may enjoy peace and stability. Until this connection, the appeal must not go unheeded.
The question of Cyprus has still not been resolved, and we support all efforts to preserve its unity, sovereignty, independence and non-aligned status.
We reaffirm our solidarity wife the Korean people. Burkina Faso supports fee proposals for a peaceful reunification of Korea and to feat end we urge fee continuation of the North-South dialogue.
The efforts of the international community, in particular those of the African countries, led to fee beginning of a solution in Angola and Mozambique. Burkina Paso sincerely hopes feat these efforts will culminate in a final settlement guaranteeing fee national unity and independence of these two fraternal countries and making it possible for them to channel their energies into the tasks of development. And may all interference be excluded.
Wife regard to Western Sahara, courageous decisions have been taken to speed up fee peace process drawn up by fee United Nations on fee basis of fee relevant resolutions of the organization off African Unity (OAU). We urge the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts in conjunction wife fee current Chairman of the OAU with a view to implementing the right to self-determination of the Sahraoui people.
A distressing conflict has pitted two West African brothers against each other. Like a number of other African States, Burkina Faso is closely following this dispute and, in its capacity as Chairman to the Economic Continuity of West African States, is exerting its own efforts to find a peaceful and final settlement. Burkina Faso welcomes and is gratified by the recent agreements entered into by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad, thus putting an end to 16 years of fratricidal confrontation.
It can be seen that there are still regional conflicts, although for the past two years the international climate has been described as having improved. Burkina Faso recognizes that there has been some improvement in the way in which problem are being tackled. Systematic confrontation or confrontation as a matter of principle has given way to dialogue and negotiation. No one could complain of such a turn of events. Nevertheless, for us, the countries of the South or fee third world, we cannot confuse style with substance.
Although changing fee way fee problem is posed helps to resolve it, feat does not change the actual nature of the problem.
Indeed, fee inequity of fee international economic system is penalizing our national economies and frustrating the efforts and sacrifices of our peoples. Year after year we have made use of fee rostrum of fee United Nations to make known our ills; we have gone to the institutions of the United Nations to heal our afflictions. In May 1986, fee critical economic situation in Africa led to the adoption of the United Nations programme of Action for African Recovery and Development, but its promise has not been fully realized. External debt has emphasized a glaring and obvious injustice. Our products are increasingly fetching below-market prices, while we are reimbursing many times over fee money we have borrowed, in view of the play of bank interest rates. This situation must be seen as very serious by debtors and creditors alike, because in fee long run it will be harmful to all parties.
In a world of interdependence where words are uttered and used as weapons - which, in any case have finally become blunted - it is nevertheless necessary to have recourse to negotiation, take into account the interests involved and inevitably move towards the implementation of a lust international economic order. The special session on international economic co-operation, to be held in April 1990, should not be just one more meeting* rather, it should mark a new approach in economic relations among States so that justice, equity and mutual advantage prevail in the world economy. However unrealistic this outcome may seem, it is nevertheless the best way to protect us all from economic paralysis and the incalculable consequences that that would entail.
In this connection, the environment which is today considered everyone's business, has long suffered the excesses and uses of the North, whether it be the ozone layer, acid rains, toxic wastes - we know where the responsibility lies. Hence we should welcome the fact that the environment has become an essential concern and that preparations are now being made for the United Nations conference on environment and development, scheduled for 1992.
We listened very closely to the statement made by President Virgilio Barco of Colombia. As we see it, two lessons can be learned from its the first is that, as he said, the international struggle against drugs cannot be a mere war of words; and the second, that in order to stem the supply of drugs, we must stem the demand for drugs.
In both cases it is co-operation and solidarity that can heal this contemporary wound. All the scourges that today beset human society can be overcome only through co-operation and solidarity.
A deplorable economic and social situation is the reason why this drug culture has developed. Burkina Paso affirms that this is a case involving human rights and
the rights of peoples. We refuse to follow anyone who ascribes importance exclusively to the individual and to the protection and security of the individual, when millions are ignored, trampled underfoot, exploited, reduced to earning a living by compromising their lives and the lives off others. The champions off human rights have enough compassion to defend freedom; but not enough wisdom to defend human beings made of flesh and blood, not enough wisdom to stop children born and raised in disastrous circumstances from being condemned to a life of delinquency and crime. 
Somewhere along the line more attention began to be paid to abstract ideas than to meeting our practical, basic, concrete, pressing, real needs, when we seek to defend human rights we should begin with those needs. The defence of human rights begins with the promotion of a just international economic order.
In Burkina Faso, Comrade President Compaore, the leader of the Popular Front, is translating that desire for justice by organizing and ensuring the participation of people of all social levels and classes in making the political and economic decisions that mould our national life and our future. Democracy is a requirement of the Burkina Faso revolution. Revolution, for us, is not a hollow revolutionary slogan taken out of context, but the creative spirit linked to practical action towards qualitative change sustained and implemented in a permanent, organized way by the mass of the people for the mass of the people. In that context, women play a major role, children receive particular care and society acts in its own best interests, in order to live within its culture in harmony with the world.
Many have spoken of the imminent twenty-first century, the heritage we shall bequeath to our children, the increasingly interdependent world, threats and hopes. We in Burkina Faso want to live with our brothers throughout the world as worthy, free people. Co-operation and solidarity are the virtues needed today, tomorrow, and forever if we wish to bequeath a future to the generations to come. With that in mind we must be just and specific.
","We cannot speak of any changes or improvement when Nelson Mandela and his companions remain in prison, when the movements that are demanding freedom are systematically restrained  when political parties and democratic movements are suspended, when the state of emergency is still in force, and when there is no sign of the beginnings of any real, consistent or detailed dialogue aimed at resolving the problem. In a world of interdependence where words are uttered and used as weapons - which, in any case have finally become blunted - it is nevertheless necessary to have recourse to negotiation, take into account the interests involved and inevitably move towards the implementation of a lust international economic order. In this connection, the environment which is today considered everyone's business, has long suffered the excesses and uses of the North, whether it be the ozone layer, acid rains, toxic wastes - we know where the responsibility lies. The champions off human rights have enough compassion to defend freedom; but not enough wisdom to defend human beings made of flesh and blood, not enough wisdom to stop children born and raised in disastrous circumstances from being condemned to a life of delinquency and crime. Revolution, for us, is not a hollow revolutionary slogan taken out of context, but the creative spirit linked to practical action towards qualitative change sustained and implemented in a permanent, organized way by the mass of the people for the mass of the people."
44,1989,MNG,"ï»¿First of all let me congratulate Mr. Joseph Garba on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. We wish him great success in carrying out his important duties. We join with previous speakers who have expressed their gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his skilful guidance of the work of the last session.
The United Nations, as a universal instrument for the maintenance of a secure world order, vividly reflects the changes in the political climate of the world. It is gratifying to note that in the course of the last two or three years optimistic voices have been clearly heard within this house concerning a renewed relaxation of international tensions.
We share this optimism. Such optimism may be attributed, above all, to the emerging consensus in the international community on the necessity for the coexistence and co-operation of all States and to the experiences gained and the achievements made in resolving contemporary issues. In our view, the present positive trend is likely to succeed and to become a continuous and irreversible process. The first stones of its foundation are being hewn from very solid elements, expressing a balance of the legitimate interests of the parties in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. This reinforces our belief in the possibility of creating a more just and humane future. It will naturally require extensive joint efforts on the part of all States.
It is important that the majority of States already realize this fact more clearly and are acting accordingly. There is a continuing dialogue between the great Powers in the search for ways aid means of fostering detente in all its dimensions. An all-European process encompasses new frontiers. An ever increasing number of States are contributing to the efforts to solve acute regional problems. Awareness and concern over the world-wide harmful consequences of the ecological crisis and the inequitable international economic order are growing. The importance of a comprehensive approach to the problems of strengthening international peace and security is gaining increasing recognition.
One of the new trends of the present time is the growing prestige and role of the United Nations in world affairs. Hare the tendency towards co-operation is being strengthened aid the United Nations is being used in a manner in which it was originally conceived by its founders. The Mongolian people's Republic welcomes the intensification of the peace-making efforts of the United Nations and the good offices of secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and wishes him further success in his noble endeavours. We advocate a broader release of the potential of the world Organization for the resolution of global problems, such as disarmament, putting an end to regional conflicts, overcoming the socio-economic and technological backwardness of developing countries, and for the resolution of the problems of external indebtedness, protection of the environment, the struggle against the traffic in narcotic drugs, and others.
The Mongolian delegation fully shares the idea of enhancing the role of the United Nations in the prevention of problems, expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization.
The Mongolian People's Republic will strive to expand its practical co-operation with the United Nations and the organizations of its system.
A process of critical analysis of all experience in constructing our socialist society and of drawing appropriate lessons for the future, is under way in my country. The problems which my country faces in its development today are typical of those facing many developing countries. The essence of these problems lies in the necessity to accelerate socio-economic development and on this basis to improve the well-being of the people. In order to achieve these goals it is equally important to set in motion both domestic and external factors. It is against this background that certain aspects of our foreign policy are under review.
The relations of Mongolia with the socialist countries under the impact of ongoing restructuring processes are assuming an increasingly business-like character and their effectiveness is growing.
The Mongolian People's Republic, as a developing country, is endeavouring to enhance this status in international organizations and to strengthen its solidarity and co-operation with the other developing countries within the framework of these organizations. We are reconsidering our staid vis-Ã -vis certain international economic and monetary-financial institutions with a view to benefiting from the services they render to developing countries.
The realization of that policy by my Government is evidenced in its obtaining of Observer status in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, in its membership in the Group of 77 in the establishment of diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community, and in its efforts to obtain membership in the Asian Development Bank.
Apart from that, efforts are being made to broaden its political, trade, economic aid cultural co-operation with other States. We are interested in making substantial headway in developing mutually advantageous trade and economic ties with the market economies. Initial steps are being taken towards that end.
All of this is needed, in our view, in order to lay the foundation for the subsequent constructive participation of Mongolia in a broader regional and international integration.
We see the primary objective of the international community in the sustained consolidation of the present positive trends. Equally important is the task of promoting trust and mutual understanding between States at both the global and the regional level. Thi3 is also essential for developing broad, mutually beneficial international co-operation and for tackling the existing serious problems.
In this regard, the region of Asia and the Pacific to which my country belongs deserves special attention. As is known, the most protracted and acute regional conflicts continue to exist there. The reduction of military confrontation, the elimination of foreign military bases and the development of economic, ecological and other co-operation are issues that must be duly dealt with.
Experience shows that it is better to seek generally acceptable solutions through dialogue and negotiations. It is pertinent to stress here the importance of normal, close relations between the great Powers of the region. In this connection, we wish to stress the truly international significance of the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
Mongolia is seeking to contribute to the positive changes in our region. Our response to this improved atmosphere in our region has been evidenced by the Mongolian and Soviet agreements on the withdrawal of a major portion of the Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia and by the decision on a marked reduction of our armed forces and military expenditures.
My Government has recently advanced an idea with regard to the possibility of holding a dialogue on a regular basis among the countries of the northern part of the region of Asia and the Pacific. It seeks to help find ways and means of developing co-operation in various areas, settling existing problems, and strengthening mutual understanding and confidence among the nations of the region. We invite the parties concerned to reflect on this idea and to exchange views on it. The Mongolian Government favours an early political solution to regional conflicts. We call for an immediate cessation of the bloodshed in Afghanistan. The Geneva Agreements must be strictly implemented by all parties. It is important, in our view, to examine closely the recent proposals, which could create additional opportunities for resolving this problem.
We welcome the withdrawal of the Vietnamese volunteers as announced earlier and we hope that the dialogue that took place or. the Cambodian issue will continue and bring about a comprehensive solution to that problem.
As in the past, Mongolia advocates a peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea without outside interference. I wish to note here the importance of exerting further efforts toward undertaking an inter-Korean dialogue.
Aggravation of the dangerous situation in Lebanon end the absence of practical results in resolving the Palestine problem, despite realism and the desire to co-operate demonstrated by the PLO leadership, emphatically underline the need to achieve an early and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis and to convene for this purpose an international conference, with the participation of all the interested parties, including the State of Palestine and the permanent members of the Security Council. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and that of all States oÂ£ the region to a secure existence should be ensured.
The Mongolian people's Republic is in favour of full implementation of the United Nations plan on the granting of independence to Namibia.
We resolutely condemn the policy and practices of apartheid and advocate their liquidation. We are in solidarity with the struggle of the Nicaraguan people and its Government for their freedom and independence, sovereignty and national dignity. The Mongolian delegation supports the efforts of the Central American States and the United Nations aimed at the peaceful settlement of the problem.
The disarmament process set in motion by the Treaty on the Elimination of Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - has of late been gaining new momentum. Here we have in mind the prospects of concluding an agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive armaments of the USSR and the United States in the light of the recent accords in Wyoming, of banning chemical weapons and initiating the destruction of their stockpiles, as well as of achieving real progress at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe.
We submit that the General Assembly should renew its call for the cessation of the arms race, for the prevention of the militarization of outer space and for the complete prohibition of nuclear tests. The Mongolian People's Republic favours the convening of an international conference with the purpose of converting the 1963 Moscow Treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in three environments into a treaty on a comprehensive banning of such tests. The Mongolian delegation shares the view that the positive changes and shifts of a political nature in the world are not yet buttressed by adequate progress in resolving the problems of international economic relations. The development of economic co-operation is frustrated not only by factors of an objective nature but also by artificial barriers which, inter alia, are at variance with the overall spirit of the new detente.
We deem it important to intensify the global dialogue, first of all within the framework of the United Nations, cm world trade and economic relations in all major directions - North-South, East-West and South-South.
we share the reasoning of the other developing countries, expressed particularly at the Belgrade summit conference of the non-aligned countries and at the Caracas ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 that the consequences of the absence of a solution to the problems of the economic development of these countries will have an increasing impact on the developed countries as well. This global interdependence should be established on an equal and collective footing with a view to ensuring social justice and economically sustainable development for all. In our opinion, this interdependence should be duly taken into account in the elaboration of the international development strategy for the 1990s and in the decisions of the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation.
The problem of the external indebtedness of developing countries still remains acute. The ongoing dialogue within the United Nations and outside it on resolving this problem inspires some optimism.
As is known, the protection of nature and of the environment has become a most important global problem and one which requires urgent international efforts. The Mongolian People's Republic therefore attaches great importance to the convening in 1992 of a United Nations conference on the environment and development. In this context I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Assembly to the idea submitted by the Mongolian delegation at the latest session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific on the elaboration of regional and sub regional programmes of action for the protection of the environment in the Asia and the Pacific region and on the creation of a regional centre on the environment. In our opinion, such steps would help to co-ordinate the national efforts of the countries of the region to create ecologically sound living conditions.
The consequences of environmental degradation adversely affect the living conditions of many people, even of entire nations. This problem has become so acute that it is, in our view, essential to raise the question of putting into treaty language the issue of a human right to a better and healthy environment. This question does not seem to be adequately reflected in the existing international instruments on human rights. We therefore deem it desirable to consider the question of making an appropriate amendment to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Sights.
In doing so we proceed from the premise that the development of international law and the ensuring of its primacy are important elements in strengthening peace and co-operation among States. In this connection, we consider that the proposal of the non-aligned countries to declare a United Nations decade of international law a timely initiative.
","We advocate a broader release of the potential of the world Organization for the resolution of global problems, such as disarmament, putting an end to regional conflicts, overcoming the socio-economic and technological backwardness of developing countries, and for the resolution of the problems of external indebtedness, protection of the environment, the struggle against the traffic in narcotic drugs, and others. Our response to this improved atmosphere in our region has been evidenced by the Mongolian and Soviet agreements on the withdrawal of a major portion of the Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia and by the decision on a marked reduction of our armed forces and military expenditures. Aggravation of the dangerous situation in Lebanon end the absence of practical results in resolving the Palestine problem, despite realism and the desire to co-operate demonstrated by the PLO leadership, emphatically underline the need to achieve an early and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis and to convene for this purpose an international conference, with the participation of all the interested parties, including the State of Palestine and the permanent members of the Security Council. The Mongolian People's Republic favours the convening of an international conference with the purpose of converting the 1963 Moscow Treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in three environments into a treaty on a comprehensive banning of such tests. In our opinion, this interdependence should be duly taken into account in the elaboration of the international development strategy for the 1990s and in the decisions of the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation."
44,1989,BHR,"ï»¿
It gives me pleasure to start by congratulating Ambassador Garba of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session and wishing him success in directing its proceedings. I should also like to convey our thanks and appreciation to Mr. Dante Caputo who, as President of the Assembly at its forty-third session, guided our proceedings with admirable efficiency.
I cannot fail to refer in that respect to the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the organization as a complete record of the issues and topics competently addressed by the United Nations since the forty-third session. I avail myself of this opportunity to express our utmost appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the prominent role he has assumed in this regard and for his unrelenting efforts to promote the role of the organization in the maintenance of peace and security and in the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations Charter.
This session convenes in an atmosphere of international detente characterized by a spirit of dialogue, the building of bridges of trust and co-operation among States and the solution of international problems by peaceful means rather than by confrontation and resorting to the use of force. during the past two years, the world has witnessed an energetic move towards resolving some of the chronic regional conflicts which, for many years, have been a source of concern to the international community. We also witnessed a collective tendency towards strengthening the role of the United Nations in controlling the hotbeds of tension in several critical areas of the world.
At the beginning of this month leaders of the non-aligned countries met in Belgrade to examine and assess the international situation and to discuss the latest developments on the road to peaceful coexistence, the coexistence which constitutes the main objective of the Movement. The wills of the Member States of the Movement converged on the need to improve the methods for dealing with international problems, in order to keep pace with the latest developments that have taken place on the world scene, and to devise a unified conception of an integrated strategy for a future in which co-operation in all fields will prevail.
The lessons of history and the experiences of the past have proved to us that preserving the vitality of the role of the United Nations in the area of international co-operation must remain a fundamental constant in our changing world. That is because we live in a world where boundaries overlap and interests and relationships intertwine to such an extent that it is impossible for any individual State, no matter how powerful or how great its potential, to isolate itself within its own boundaries and solve its problems alone and apart from the outside world.
The improvement we are witnessing in the relations between the two major blocs confirms our conviction that differences in political philosophies and ideologies should not impede the accommodation of different interests, nor should they hamper co-operation between States with different political and socio-economic systems.
Proceeding from this perspective it can be said that the decade of the nineties heralds drastic changes in the course of international relations, as well as positive trends and constructive steps to develop the concept of collective security, a concept which once was only a vision in the minds of the architects of the Charter. Such new changes and trends would, in turn, develop multilateral international co-operation in the coming years for the promotion and advancement of the international community to the benefit of mankind and human civilization as a whole.
During the 1980s, the United Nations has had to tackle various global political, economic and social problems. The United Nations fulfilled the tasks entrusted to it and has been able to adjust to this changing world. It has thus asserted its credibility and ensured its future viability. The extent of the change in the working methods of the Organization in response to new developments on the world scene becomes evident from even a quick glance it the items on the agenda of successive sessions of the General Assembly.. However, the criterion for measuring its success in carrying out its future responsibilities will no doubt be decided by how much it can absorb the facts of the new era and conform to them in order to address the issues of the environment - poverty, famine, disease and natural disasters.
It goes without saying that the United Nations cannot carry out these vital tasks without the contribution of every State towards finding an appropriate formula for achieving interdependence among nations in a new world where the human race is perceived as an indivisible whole.
Allow me in this context to concentrate on three main issues which we feel should be dealt with seriously and effectively. The issues should be given close attention by the United Nations so that appropriate solutions may be found to them. The first such issue is the promotion of peace and security in the world. Progress achieved in the peaceful solution of certain regional conflicts has aroused a feeling of optimism in the international community, a feeling which often leads us to believe that real possibilities for finding just and lasting solutions to the pending international problems do exist. However, when it comes to the question of Palestine, such hopes dissipate as Israel reveals its true intentions about peace.
Over the four decades since its founding, Israel's talk of peace has remained one of many empty slogans,, since its response to Arab peace initiatives was invariably to consolidate its occupation, refine its methods of oppression and intimidation of the Palestinian people, demean their dignity and violate their human rights. Then came the heroic intifadah which wore out the Zionist entity. Having despaired of suppressing it, Israel believes that by sowing dissension in the Palestinian ranks and by absorbing international pressures through what it calls the Shamir election initiative, it can quell that intifadah. The awareness and steadfastness displayed by the Palestinians, however, came contrary to all Israeli expectations and accounts. The Palestine Liberation organization (PLO), the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, was able to face up to the Israeli manoeuvre by asserting wisely and objectively that free elections cannot be held under occupation, nor can they be held away from international supervision. Such elections should take place within the framework of a comprehensive peace process in which Israel declares its acceptance of the principle of 'land for peace'.
At the core of the peace process in the Middle East is the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination in their own national soil and to establish their own independent State. It would be totally unjust to pay heed to the allegations advanced by Israel about the dangers inherent in establishing the Palestinian State, since such allegations are null and void and designed to help Israel overcome the dilemma of the intifadah in which it has been fumbling blindly for nearly two years.
We therefore appeal to the General Assembly to call upon the Security Council to impose international legitimacy in accordance with General Assembly resolution 43/176, which defines the foundations of a just peace between all parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict as well as urgently convening the international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations as the appropriate vehicle for finding a realistic solution to the Middle East problem.
In the interest of establishing a just and lasting peace in the Gulf area, the State of Bahrain since the very beginning welcomed the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran and the commencement of negotiations between them under the auspices of the United Nations. While supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at conciliating the viewpoints of both parties and narrowing their differences, we are hopeful that both countries will be able to arrive at a formula for a durable, comprehensive and just peace between them through the implementation of Security Council resolution 593 (1987) in all its provisions, since that resolution is a comprehensive peace plan, as well as by adherence to the principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference in internal affairs of other countries and the establishment of relations on the basis of mutual trust and respect.
regarding the Lebanese crisis, 15 years of a bloody strife have failed to ensure security or stability for Lebanon. They have convinced all Lebanese factions of the necessity of finding through dialogue a peaceful solution that will achieve national accord in order to ensure the country's future and preserve its unity free from all external interference. We therefore urge all people of good will and appeal to their conscience to support the efforts of the tripartite Arab high Committee. In welcoming the resumption of its efforts to end the Lebanese crisis we earnestly hope that all parties concerned will co-operate with the Committee in order to enable it to fulfil its task and that all parties will begin to implement its resolutions for the good of Lebanon and its people.
The right to self-determination is organically linked to the question of promoting peace and security in southern Africa. We have followed with interest the efforts of the United Nations and the endeavours of its Secretary-General to implement Security Council resolution 43 5 (1978) on the independence of Namibia. We look forward to the day when an independent Namibia will take its place in this very Hall and we consider that to be one of the important achievements of the United Nations in its ceaseless quest to eliminate colonialism and support every people's struggle for freedom and national independence.
Despite the positive and encouraging developments in southern Africa, the Pretoria regime continues to persist in its racist and inhuman policies. We therefore renew our call to the international community to continue its efforts aimed at completely eradicating the policies of apartheid in South Africa arid at the establishment of a democratic fraternal society in which freedom, justice, equality and respect for human rights prevail. As for the situation in Afghanistan, we hope that the United Nations will continue to utilize its capabilities and use its good offices to find a solution to the prevailing situation there that will enable the Afghan people to choose the political and social system acceptable to it, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.
It is regrettable also that the question of Cyprus remains unresolved and that the split between the two Cypriot communities continues to exist. In this regard I should like to reiterate Bahrain's support for the unity of Cyprus, its independence and non-aligned status. We hope that the bi-communal dialogue conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General will make progress.
We hope too that direct dialogue between the two parts of the Korean peninsula will improve relations between them and help realize the aspirations of the Korean people for a restoration of their national unity.
The second issue, which is no less important than the first, is that of global development. It poses a major challenge to the international community in its persistent endeavour to lay the foundations of economic and social progress and improve the standards of living of people throughout the world, as envisaged in the Charter. The riches of our world are distributed very unevenly. In this era of the conquest of space and impressive scientific and technological advancement, it is no longer tolerable to find that poorer nations continue to struggle for survival under circumstances of extreme austerity which have already led to unstable political, economic and social conditions in them. Indeed it is distressing that more than one fourth of the world's population should lack adequate shelter and that 100 million people should be without shelter altogether. While demographic and social indicators can explain the magnitude of the tragedy in the countries of the third world, nevertheless it is underdevelopment that is the most complex and serious problem of our times.
The international community is facing an acute crisis as a result, inter alia, of structural imbalances in the world economic orders the widening gap between the developed and developing countries, the majority of which is still suffering from external debt problems; deteriorating terms of trade, and unstable rates of exchange. These factors have combined to produce a negative phenomenon reflected in the reverse transfer of financial resources from developing to developed countries and a marked impasse in the North-South dialogue.
Solving the debt crisis requires, in the first place, the elaboration of a new plan for the development of the third world and that creditor countries recognize the need of debtor nations to be able to negotiate collectively on the basis of an integrated programme to be developed following a realistic examination and through joint co-ordination, in order to bring about a more effective and global policy. The current international situation provides a propitious opportunity for the success of such an initiative. The present improvement in the international atmosphere must be exploited to give new impetus to multilateral co-operation so that feasible, permanent solutions to the third world debt crisis can be found.
It is now widely recognized that, so long as the arms race continues, development cannot be fully achieved. Although the world has witnessed a rapid arms race during the previous three decades, present possibilities are promising: disarmament proposals, including initiatives for the reduction of conventional weapons, are being considered by the States members of both the North Atlantic Treaty organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. The success of such initiatives would surely be of great help in reducing tensions in Europe and in re-orienting international efforts towards comprehensive development programmes.
While disarmament and arms reductions are prerequisites for development, economic integration is the most important element of its synergy and the most noticeable component of its success. Economic integration has become an important developmental necessity dictated by the demands of our times in the context of current world developments, and is one alternative for solving the economic problems of developing countries.
We are living today in an era of major economic groupings based on a balancing of interests and interdependence. While most of the successful economic groupings today are composed of developed countries, it is the developing countries that are in dire need of such institutions to enable them to achieve economic integration and build societies of progress and prosperity for their peoples. The European Community was tine first to succeed in building the edifice of economic integration that will culminate in an economically united Europe in 1992. Similarly, the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) has, since its inception in 1981, followed the same course for achieving the integration of its six member States on their way to socio-economic unity.
Stressing the importance of such regional co-operation, Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, the Amir of the State of Bahrain and Chairman of the current session of the GCC, has said, 'Developments in our contemporary world, together with the interrelationship of international interests and their continuous interaction with changing events, have dictated political, economic and social tendencies towards co-operation and integration within the various regional groups, leading them to unite their entities, thus keeping once with the march of time and the progress of the human race. It was from this premise that the Gulf Co-operation Council regarded as one of the most important, if not the most important, achievements of our region.'
Since the signing of the Unified Economic agreement in 1981, the GCC States have taken steady steps toward economic integration through expanding the Gulf common market and accelerating economic development. The Manama Declaration issued by the ninth summit meeting of Bahrain held in December 1988, affirmed the determination of the States members of the Council to continue working jointly to attain the aspirations of their peoples. The Supreme Council also adopted a number of important resolutions which involved encouraging the establishment of joint industrial ventures, reinforcing the principle of Gulf citizenship, permitting the citizens of GCC States to own shares in the joint stock companies active in the economic field, and equal tax treatment for citizens of all GCC States in the area of investments.
This year has also witnessed the birth of two other similar organizations: the Council for Arab Co-operation and the Arab Maghreb Union. The GCC welcomed the establishment of both of these new Arab groupings as a qualitative and essential development strengthening relations between the States members of the League of Arab States and as a channel for natural communication between them and the United Nations with a view to achieving the regional development that the Charter encourages. We are certain that the three Arab groupings will effectively endeavour to evolve co-operation at the regional level and promote the process of economic integration, thus contributing to the welfare and prosperity of the Arab region.
The phenomenon of the spread of narcotic drugs has become a factor impeding progress and undermining the very foundations of societies, particularly through its devastating effects on young people, who are an important pillar of development. Islam has fought the abuse of narcotics and banned their use for all but scientific and medical purposes. Thus, our Islamic jurisprudence (Shari'a) has provided us with an invincible bastion of ethical values that has limited the spread of this phenomenon in our societies.
Despite the fact that more than 30 years have elapsed since the launching of the international campaign against the abuse of narcotic drugs, this problem is still with us, albeit in varying degrees of severity from country to country. The whole world today is organizing concerted efforts and intensive campaigns against drug addiction and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, which are destructive activities and a crime against humanity as a whole. In accordance with the teachings of our Islamic religion, the State of Bahrain has given its maximum attention to avoiding the spread of narcotic drugs and drug addiction within its boundaries, and has promulgated a series of laws to prohibit the use of, addiction to and circulation of narcotics and illicit trafficking in them.
Proceeding from our keen desire to contribute to the international campaign against the abuse of narcotic drugs, and in support of international co-operation for eradicating this dangerous phenomenon which affects various cross-sect ions and groups of human society, the State of Bahrain has decided to accede to the following conventions: the Single Convention on narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol; the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971; and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 - which we signed yesterday.
The third issue, the environment, is closely linked to the previous issue, since development and the environment are indivisible. Today, I do not think there can be any disagreement on the importance of preserving the mechanisms that ensure the renewal of the biosphere in order to protect the future of humanity. The problems of air pollution, desertification, the transfer of wastes, pollution of the seas and oceans, the depletion of the ozone layer, and other problems, are at the forefront of the list of international concerns owing to their negative impact on humanity's present and future.
The world today has reached a stage where some economic development programmes are threatening the environment with irreparable damage. Such damage could even endanger the elements themselves and the balance of nature's cycle on which the very survival of planet Earth depends.
Our view of the world we live in has undergone a conspicuous transformation. It is a view of ceaselessly evolving and constantly changing world. This vision requires a new international strategy for development governed by the principle of the imperative of concordance and harmony between the objectives of development and the requirements for preserving the environment, a strategy that would serve mankind without endangering its fate.
Thus, environmental preservation is no longer limited to merely selecting appropriate methods to deal with certain accidents or to adopting a series of measures designed to deal with each case separately, but calls for an approach which seeks to eliminate the contradictions between the rationale behind the strategies for economic development and that which governs the policies for preserving the environment.
Hence we welcome the initiatives put forward in this respect, particularly the proposals of the committee presided over by Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway. We believe that those proposals constitute a good basis for revitalizing international co-operation in this field and for intensifying efforts with a view to finding an approach which would ensure safe development.
In this regard, we also support the convening, in 1992, of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development to deal with the major issues facing our contemporary world in the context of social and economic development, as well as the implementation of the recommendations of the Global Committee on the Environment and Development, and the Environmental Perspective to the year 2000 and beyond, in addition to formulating a programme for future activities in this vital area.
The international community is at present undergoing a process of radical transformation, a process which will be reflected, in one way or another, in the components of the existing world order. A characteristic of such historical transformation is the presence of thesis and anti-thesis, the synthesis of which would help to make progress. Consequently, the future of the world is dependent upon the stability of the process of confidence-building among nations and upon how deeply rooted are the yearnings for the unity of human fate in the face of major challenges, foremost among which are the strengthening of peace, the promotion of
development and the preservation of the environment.
As a focal point for international action, the United Nations must, at this important phase in the history of mankind, evolve its role in order to achieve the common objectives which are dictated by mutual interests. It must endeavour to restore the unity of humankind in all its aspects, so as to overcome the narrow self-interests of States and provide for the role of the human being in rehabilitating this Earth and preserving its civilization.
We need not recall today that we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first century, with the responsibilities and obligations that implies. This should prompt us to close ranks around our Organization to ensure that it proceeds towards bright prospects and a prosperous future for coming generations.
","While supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at conciliating the viewpoints of both parties and narrowing their differences, we are hopeful that both countries will be able to arrive at a formula for a durable, comprehensive and just peace between them through the implementation of Security Council resolution 593 (1987) in all its provisions, since that resolution is a comprehensive peace plan, as well as by adherence to the principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference in internal affairs of other countries and the establishment of relations on the basis of mutual trust and respect. As for the situation in Afghanistan, we hope that the United Nations will continue to utilize its capabilities and use its good offices to find a solution to the prevailing situation there that will enable the Afghan people to choose the political and social system acceptable to it, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. Stressing the importance of such regional co-operation, Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, the Amir of the State of Bahrain and Chairman of the current session of the GCC, has said, 'Developments in our contemporary world, together with the interrelationship of international interests and their continuous interaction with changing events, have dictated political, economic and social tendencies towards co-operation and integration within the various regional groups, leading them to unite their entities, thus keeping once with the march of time and the progress of the human race. This vision requires a new international strategy for development governed by the principle of the imperative of concordance and harmony between the objectives of development and the requirements for preserving the environment, a strategy that would serve mankind without endangering its fate. Thus, environmental preservation is no longer limited to merely selecting appropriate methods to deal with certain accidents or to adopting a series of measures designed to deal with each case separately, but calls for an approach which seeks to eliminate the contradictions between the rationale behind the strategies for economic development and that which governs the policies for preserving the environment."
44,1989,HTI,"ï»¿May I first address to you. Sir, the congratulations of the delegation of Haiti and tell you how very pleased we were to see you elected to the presidency of this, the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal qualifications, your vast experience in dealing with international affairs and what you have done at the helm of the Special Committee Against Apartheid have allowed us to take the full measure of your qualities, and they ensure the fullest success for the work of this session.
I should also like to voice our gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, who brought the full range of his competence and wisdom to bear upon his work and thus fully merited the confidence the Assembly had placed in him. We pay special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has succeeded with so much courage and determination in pursuing progress towards obtaining the objectives embodied in the Charter. Without a doubt, the United Nations owes him much for the restoration of confidence it enjoys today. Let it be assured of the fullest support of my country as he pursues his efforts for peace.
This decade is drawing to a close with particularly contrasting results facing us in terms of matters economic and political. The forty-fourth session is in duty bound to reflect a period when the international community as a whole is stopping and thinking about these matters. There can be no doubt that we are living through a particularly crucial period in which progressively there is emerging before us a new landscape in international political relations. In this connection, we think it obvious that the United Nations, so long the butt of complaints and denunciation. is, new that it is being endowed with the wherewithal, ready to play a more intensive role in facilitating the resolution of conflicts that have been with us for a long time and were once deemed insoluble. The cessation of hostilities in the Persian Gulf and the emergence of solutions to  the questions of Western Sahara, Cyprus and Namibia are highly significant successes that bear witness to the restored credibility of the United Nations. Rarely in the past half-century or more has the world experienced such dynamic progress towards peace. These results confirm, if confirmation be needed, the overriding importance of the purposes and principles upon which the United Nations is founded and the increasing adherence to them by its Member states. This is a source of satisfaction and hope. At the same time, there are grounds for welcoming the conjunction of factors that now offers an unexpected opportunity to change the confrontational terms of East-west relations. The proposals recently put forward by the United States and the Soviet Union and the commitments made at the Paris Conference on banning chemical weapons give good reason for hope concerning the prospect of genuinely controlling the arms race.
There would be a great temptation to believe that this state of affairs represented a turning point in the establishment of a new international order if there were not at the same time and year after year, the growing, unacceptable gulf separating the North from the South. Furthermore, one cannot ignore the still numerous obstacles that continue to block the road to peace, in particular the persistence of various hotbeds of tension in many areas of the world and the emergence of new challenges that rightly command the attention of the General Assembly at this session.
Once again this year southern Africa is in the forefront of our concerns, for, notwithstanding certain apparent Changes recorded at the level of the political discourse, the structure of the apartheid system has not changed. Neither the expected freeing of Nelson Mandela nor the release of political prisoners, which could have given indisputable proof of good-will, has been obtained from the Pretoria Government. South Africa remains under the yoke of the lest regime in the world to profess a racist ideology, which is expressed in blind, systematic repression of the aspirations of the country's black majority. It is the duty of the international community, which has been to long defied, to do all it can to ensure that the South African Government ends a policy that is universally censured and condemned.
That is why, in declaring our solidarity with those resisting apartheid, notably through the courageous struggle of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania <PAC), the Republic of Haiti calls for the implementation of comprehensive sanctions against the South African regime. All in all, that is indeed the only recourse the international community has available to it by means of which to ensure that the black majority assumes, with dignity and equality of rights and duties, its rightful place in a multiracial, egalitarian and democratic society.
Following a heroic struggle, actively supported by the front-line States and waged by the genuine representatives of the people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's organization (SWAFO), and many initiatives launched by the friends of Africa, the Namibian people is preparing to decide its future. The Haitian Government welcomes this fact and the forthcoming entry of Namibia into the international community. We reiterate our firm support for United Nations efforts, vigilant action in the field by the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and the sustained efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia. They have all worked together to bring about the advent of a sovereign and independent Namibia in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).
My delegation also welcomes the climate of reconciliation which seems to be gaining ground in Angola and which, we hope and expect, will make it possible for that country to bend all its energies to the task of reconstruction and to economic and social development.
The evolution of the situation in Western Sahara makes it possible, notwithstanding a certain hesitancy, to perceive the possibility of an end to this conflict that has divided the Maghreb States for so long. The Government of Haiti notes with interest the results that the parties concerned have achieved, with the support of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the organization of African Unity (OAU) We hope that the two organizations will pursue their efforts to encourage the resumption of the indispensable dialogue between the parties, with the prospect of a referendum through which the Sahaouri people can freely decide its destiny.
In the Middle East, the violence that has been raging in the occupied territories for some two years now bears witness to the fact that Palestine is an undeniable reality at the heart of any settlement of a crisis that has persisted for too long. The maintenance of the present state of affairs is in the best interests of none of the parties concerned. Clearly, the only possible course is that of dialogue. In this connection, it seems to us that the convening of an international peace conference under United Nations auspices deserves an immediate consensus. That alone is likely to make it possible for the groundwork to be laid for an overall settlement of the conflict.
The Government of Haiti supports fully the convening of such a conference, since it is convinced that just and lasting peace in the region can be established
only on the basis of the principles defined, in particular, in Security Council resolutions 242 {1967) and 336 (1973): that the State of Israel has the right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders, and that the Palestinian people has the right to a homeland and to self-determination.
With regard to Lebanon, the Republic of Haiti, cardinal principles of whose foreign policy have always been non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and respect for the right of peoples to decide for themselves, is following with growing alarm the evolution of the situation in that martyred country. The Lebanese people are enduring a painful, bloody tragedy, which all friends of Lebanon ardently hope it will soon be ended. This is why the Government of Haiti expresses its solidarity with Lebanon and calls for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanese soil and consistent action by the international community to make it possible for the Lebanese people to regain its sovereignty and unity, with territorial integrity.
In Kampuchea the process of the withdrawal of foreign occupying forces, which must be full and final, constitutes the first step in the right direction. We sincerely congratulate the French Government on having taken the initiative, together with the members oÂ£ the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), of convening the Paris Conference, which, although it has not yet had all the hoped-for results, has none the less been a major step forward in the search for a solution. The delegation of Haiti desires the resumption of the dialogue between the parties concerned and the continuance of efforts to bring about true national reconciliation. That alone will make it possible to put an end to the tragedy that has fee so many years afflicted the Cambodian nation. The Republic of Haiti, in welcoming the proposed dialogue on the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation, believes that the time has come to explore ways and means of meeting the admission of the two Koreas to the family of the United Nations a reality, in accordance with the wishes of the parties concerned.
We note with great satisfaction that the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq is being maintained and express the hope that the negotiations already under way between the two parties will result in a settlement that will open the way to permanent peace. Similarly, Haiti welcomes the evacuation of foreign troops from Afghanistan and hopes the fratricidal war there will soon come to an end.
Closer to home, in Central America, the initiatives aimed at ending the hostilities and building peace and democracy should be encouraged. The Government of Haiti fully supports the recent Tela agreements ruling out the option of sterile confrontation, foreign pressure and recourse to force among fraternal countries that should be working together in co-operation.
The Government of Haiti, sharing the concerns of many countries across the continent, is lending tireless support to the efforts being exerted notably by the United States of America to fight illegal drug trafficking. Beyond that, the delegation of Haiti is fully prepared to lend all appropriate support to the initiative of the Caribbean countries aimed at stepping up within the framework of the United Nations the relentless struggle that must be waged against this scourge. We wish particularly to stress our solidarity with Colombia, whose courageous decisions have placed it in a difficult situation indeed.
The Republic of Haiti again reiterates its firm support for efforts aimed at international co-operation and a concerted approach to the protection of the environment from the threats looming over it, which threaten the survival of the entire planet given the accelerated deterioration of our natural resources.
Notwithstanding the vigorous economic expansion recorded in industrialized countries, the third United Nations Development Decade is ending on a note of profound disillusionment: promises have not been kept and the expectations of the third world - the vast majority - have not been met.
Suffice it to recall that in sub-Saharan Africa the gross domestic predict per capita has declined by a record 10 per cent - indeed, over 10 per cent - compared with the 1980 level, and the situation in Latin America and fee Caribbean is hardly better. Having reached the very limits of the economic, social and human costs we can bear as a result of indebtedness, which is compounded by the pernicious and destabilizing impact of adjustment programmes, the nations of the South find themselves plunged ever deeper into despair and doubt that they shall ever see movement towards a better life for our people. However paradoxical it may appear to some, fee third world continues in large measure to finance fee prosperity of the wealthy nations through a net inverse transfer of resources amounting to economic haemorrhaging feat we cannot sustain and is morally unacceptable.
Faced with such a state of affairs, the delegation of Haiti stands in solidarity with all those countries which, on fee eve of fee launching of fee fourth international development decade, call for a readjustment of the machinery governing international economic relations, and for substantive changes in strategy at the level of international co-operation, so as to enable our countries of the South finally to become an integral part of fee race to development.
To achieve this, an unprecedented effort of international solidarity is indispensable. Instead of aid - which is often uncertain, lacks common standards, and is not necessarily appropriate to the medium' and long-term needs of the recipient countries - it is necessary for fee industrialized countries to devote to co-operation for development those resources feat correspond with the needs for overall economic recovery throughout fee South. What this means, at fee very least, is that we must attain fee goals set some 30 years ago: 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product of fee donor countries.
By the sane token we consider urgent the adoption by the creditor countries, in multilateral financing institutions, of additional measures aimed at lightening the external debt burden and, if necessary, writing off such debt, particularly in the case of the poorest countries, even if these are not necessarily the most indebted ones. In this connection, what comes to mind is France's decision, announced last May at Dakar, unconditionally to write off all public credits given to 35 African countries. We hail that step, which we hope and expect will be emulated so far as all the least developed countries are concerned. We hope that this particular approach will gain currency.
How could we not stress the delicate situation facing the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, island countries and the Caribbean nations, some of which have just been hard hit by hurricane Hugo?
It is particularly appropriate for us to emphasize how acute are the social and economic problems confronting the least developed countries, often disappointed by the lack of international solidarity they receive, which in large measure explains the essential failure of the new substantive programme of action for the least developed countries for the 1980s. 	However, our country continues to have strong hopes of the special session of the General Assembly, to take place next spring, devoted to international economic co-operation. By the same token, we welcome the holding in Paris next year of the second United Nations conference on the least developed countries, hoping that in both instances these meetings will provide the second wind the North-South dialogue so  needs.
The delegation of Haiti deems it useful to remind the Assembly of the evolution of the situation in Haiti at a time when the Haitian people is turning a major corner in its history,, Having first stemmed the adverse impact of successive crises facing our State, the Government of 17 September 1988 resolutely committed itself to setting up a lasting state of law. The building of a representative democracy, based on the pre-eminence of and respect for human rights, the effective functioning of pluralism and the guaranteeing of freedoms, are all now well under way.
The Government of 17 September 1988, headed by Lieu tenant-General Prosper Avril, has successfully passed through a number of phases which we consider decisive.
The Constitution which the Haitian people gave itself in 1987 has been restored, and several articles which, because of the provisional nature of our Government, are still not in final form, will be completely restored as soon as the two legislative chambers are reconstituted.
In this connection, elections will be organized, in 1990, at all levels, on the basis of a fixed timetable, by the permanent electoral council. For the Government, this is a matter of honour. The elections will reflect the free expression of the will of the people, and will bring new leaders to the helm of the State in February 1991.
He are, of course, well aware that the reforms undertaken and the establishment of new institutions, and the forthcoming electoral contests, however decisive they may be, will not suffice in and of themselves to guarantee the future of democracy in Haiti. The experience of the past three years has shown us that the struggle for democracy can be long and difficult. Like many other countries that have recently emerged from the long might of dicta tea: Ship, Haiti is
considering the promises of the future without losing sight of the serious handicaps of the present. To succeed in building a democratic country while the country is still struggling with a particularly acute structural crisis in the economic and social spheres indeed is a major challenge for us.
In view of the importance of what is at stake, the Government of Haiti deems it necessary to reiterate its appeals to the international community to help Haiti make up foe lost time in the key areas, to free Haiti from the vice of dire poverty, in which three quarters of the population are caught, and, above all, to help them find the road to renewed growth.
We believe in a renewed and effective solidarity with friendly countries, of the North and the South, in accordance with the wish expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 39/196 adopted on 17 December 1984 entitled 'Economic assistance to Haiti'. Unfortunately, that resolution has remained a dead letter - so much so that Haiti has found itself alone in the face of the damage caused by the social problems which the country has been experiencing for more than three years. And even after cyclone Gilbert it again found itself alone, facing the desolation of the families in the southern part of the country, victims of this natural disaster, who are still waiting for some show of international solidarity. We must, at the same time, express our deepest gratitude to the countries of the Caribbean who, responsive to our legitimate aspirations, and with mutual respect, have shown us fraternal support, which we value highly.
We are certain that the united efforts of our partners can be of substantial assistance to the people of Haiti in their untiring search for economic and social betterment.
This aim is certainly not beyond our reach. It is, after all, one of the conditions and the ultimate goal of democratic life. To help us attain it is, obviously, within the framework of the highest mission of the United Nations. We therefore appeal to the Organization to lend Haiti its valuable assistance in co-ordinating far-reaching international action to help the country meet the serious challenges it faces today.
He are convinced that the United Nations, which has constantly managed to go hand in hand with our people in its long trudge towards real democracy, will once again be by our side this time. 
","There would be a great temptation to believe that this state of affairs represented a turning point in the establishment of a new international order if there were not at the same time and year after year, the growing, unacceptable gulf separating the North from the South. The Government of Haiti notes with interest the results that the parties concerned have achieved, with the support of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the organization of African Unity (OAU) We hope that the two organizations will pursue their efforts to encourage the resumption of the indispensable dialogue between the parties, with the prospect of a referendum through which the Sahaouri people can freely decide its destiny.

44,1989,OMN,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to offer Ambassador Garba of Nigeria our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that with his wide experience and eminent expertise he will conduct the work of the session with the greatest skill. I should also like to thank his predecessor, representing the fraternal Argentine Republic, for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
One of the most conspicuous and distinctive features of the United Nations is the work of the General Assembly at its regular annual sessions, together with the valuable discussions that take place in the search for the optimum means of preserving international peace and security and promoting international co-operation as the major objectives that the principles of the United Nations and its Charter strive to achieve.
It can be said that a greater measure of peace prevails in the world at present, despite the continued existence of focal points of regional and international conflicts and disputes resulting from the fact that a number of Member States fail to honour their international commitments and obligations. Our efforts must therefore focus on eliminating the difficulties that prevent the resolution of those situations so that such peace as we now experience will not once more be transformed into a state of heated confrontation.
Taking this as our point of departure it is necessary for us to expand the scope of international consultation with regard to all remaining problems. We must encourage or bring pressure to bear on parties that continue to ignore the role of the United Nations and finally, to agree to work within the framework of international legitimacy. With the easing of formerly strained relations between the forces of East and West, and in particular between the two super-Powers, a global dialogue has been instituted so that the message of peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes have begun to make their presence felt from Kampuchea to Afghanistan and from the Arabian Gulf to southern Africa. This positive climate and the international momentum generated by the beginning of the end of polarization have both opened up new prospects that must be sustained by one and all and by all available means.
Peace will continue to be the pre-eminent goal that my country strives to achieve through its policies in general. In the light of that attitude, the Sultanate has devoted all available resources to alleviating tension in the region in an endeavour to secure a peace built on good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence among all peoples. The Sultanate of Oman has from the outset adhered to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes in its relations with its neighbours as one of the principal foundations of its foreign policy. We are happy to see that that principle has now become a positive phenomenon at the international level and is becoming prevalent in endeavours to contain numerous regional problems and disputes.
It is evident that the momentum produced by the global dialogue has given hope to the peoples of the Gulf region for the consolidation of peace and co-operation. Under the auspices of the Secretary-General, the negotiations between Iraq and Iran on the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) are still continuing with a view to bringing about a durable peace between those two countries. However, despite the lapse of more than 12 months since the first round of negotiations began, the only provision of resolution 598 (1987) to have been implemented is the provision recruiting the commitment of both parties to a cease-fire. At the forty-third session of the General Assembly, we were hopeful that by the present session the Secretary-General and the two parties to the conflict would have been able to secure the full implementation of resolution 598 (1987) which we believe to be binding since both parties concerned have pledged that they will meet their international obligations.
We are fully aware that each party faces difficulties and that each of them has compelling grounds for adhering to its own viewpoint and its own interpretation of the provisions of the resolution. We nevertheless believe that the need to achieve peace, as well as adherence to the spirit of international legitimacy, to the principles that underlie the rules of international law and to the accepted precedents with regard to regional conflicts, must be adopted as the paradigm for the thinking of the two sides as well as in the negotiations between them. We believe that it is the responsibility of the Security Council to assist the two parties to the conflict to reach an understanding of the principles on which Security Council resolution 598 (1987) is based because that will enable the Secretary-General to present a uniform concept to both parties to the dispute instead of having each of the parties present him with a conflicting perception of the same resolution.
It is incumbent on us all to urge both Iraq and Iran to co-operate with the Secretary-General and with the Security Council in order to ensure the implementation of the resolution in question. We are prompted to make this assertion by the belief that the leaders of both countries have a strong desire for peace and that the climate of public opinion in both countries and the deep sentiments and common interests that link the peoples of Iraq and Iran are all factors that go to form a fitting backdrop for co-operation which must inevitably have a positive influence for peace. In the Middle East the question of Palestine remains without that political solution which would secure the legitimate political and human rights of the fraternal Palestinian people, a people which suffered a calamity some 40 years ago and which continues to confront an unknown destiny. The United Nations faces a severe test of its credibility with respect to the achievement of peace and security in the Middle East. One wonders how long the deteriorating situation that portends insufferable consequences in Palestine can be tolerated, and how long it is possible to acquiesce in Israeli policies in the Arab territories occupied since 1967.
By its rejection of Arab and international proposals for the convening of an international peace conference so that a durable solution can be sought guaranteeing peace and stability to all the peoples of the region, Israel is jeopardizing the peace and security of the Middle East. Israel's persistence in pursuing an arbitrary and obdurate policy towards the Palestinian people, Israel's denial of national and human rights of that people whether by direct force of arms or by intimidation, are unacceptable to the civilized world.
In the international information media, the world daily witnesses the bloody and unequal confrontations between defenceless Palestinians - men, women and children rising in revolt in order to regain their usurped rights - and the Israeli army fully equipped with the most sophisticated weaponry and occupying Arab territory in defiance of the will of the international community.
In the declarations made by its leaders, Israel has frequently asserted that it takes no heed of, and indeed has no regard for, the will of the international community whenever that will conflicts with its ambitions and interests. Israel, by its conduct, has also demonstrated that it has no respect whatever for international law and custom. If it had, then what law could it be that accords Israel the right to detain Palestinians for a full year without trial in their own occupied territory? On what code of law does Israel base itself in demolishing the homes of Palestinian citizens and expelling them from their homeland for no other reason than their rejection of Israeli domination and occupation?
The international community must act to halt these unlawful and inhuman practices. The time has come for Israel to yield to logic. It is time for Israel to enter into dialogue with the representatives of the Palestinian people? and it is the international conference, enjoying as it does the blessing of the international community, which provides the most appropriate forum for such a dialogue. If Israel persists in rejecting the logic of peace, then the Middle East will constantly remain a cause of concern and a source of danger to international peace and security.
It is a matter for regret that the international community should remain silent before Israel's refusal to implement those Security Council resolutions calling for the full and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Lebanese territory as a first step towards the restoration of Lebanon's unity, security and stability. We commend the efforts made by the Tripartite Arab Committee set up to resolve the Lebanese crisis, and we call upon our brothers in Lebanon, of all religious and political persuasions, to rally together and to place the best interest of their country above all other interests and considerations so that Lebanon may surmount its constitutional crisis and once again become the symbol of peace, love and brotherhood it once was.
My country recognizes and believes in the need for the peaceful settlement of disputes on a basis of mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and self-determination. It is for this reason that the Sultanate of Oman welcomed and gave its support to the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan signed on 14 April 1988. The Sultanate of Oman hails the completion of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from that country. We consider the withdrawal an important and fundamental step which has helped bring about a rapprochement of viewpoints among the various factions in Afghanistan, a step which has opened the way for the Afghan people to choose the system that it itself desires without outside interference. The Sultanate of Oman is hopeful that the parties concerned will succeed in forming a government that will bring together all segments of the Afghan people and that will endeavour to bring about the return of the Afghan refugees to their homes, preserve the Islamic identity and neutrality of Afghanistan and establish the necessary relations of good-neighbourliness with contiguous States, including the Soviet Union.
The ASEAN States have made exhaustive efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Kampuchean problem. The Sultanate of Oman, commends those efforts, and particularly those made by Indonesia in this connection and regards the outcome of the international Conference on Kampuchea recently held at Paris as auspicious. We are fully confident that the results will lead to the inception of a new era for the Kampuchean people enabling that people to bring down the curtain on the tragedies of the past and begin to rebuild its country under a system of government chosen by itself for itself. Despite the fact that the Paris Conference did not achieve any concrete progress, it is important that a dialogue continue among all parties so that a political solution to the Kampuchean problem be achieved.
On the threshold of the 1990s, we find ourselves imbued with a sense of optimism with regard to the role of diplomacy and negotiation as valuable and prestigious instruments in international relations. We had hoped that the new turn towards optimism in international relations would make a significant and decisive contribution to the future of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean so that the relevant conference could be held in Colombo in 1990 as a first step towards the implementation of the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 2832 (XXVI). However, the difficulties raised by some States may prevent this. We call upon those States to adopt a spirit of conciliation and to allow efforts to be stepped up so that the conference can be held as scheduled.
The world has rejoiced that agreement has been reached which will lead to the independence of Namibia. We should therefore particularly like to congratulate the people of Namibia and the African nations on the Namibian people's achievement. After 74 years of colonialism as inhabitants of a mandated Territory, the people of Namibia has now begun to reap the fruits of its struggle and its sacrifices. As we salute and revere the efforts of all those who have contributed to giving effect to Security Council resolution 435 (1978), we should also like to take this opportunity to express our pleasure at the success of the summit meeting recently held in Zaire, at which a settlement was reached by the conflicting parties in Angola. We are prompted by the hope that this agreement will be a good omen not only for Angola but for the region as a whole.
Despite the progress of peace in Namibia and Angola, the prospects for peace in southern Africa remain indistinct because of the South African regime's continued pursuit of the policy of racial discrimination against the black majority. We shall support the international efforts aimed at achieving justice and equality among all members of the population, and we hope that those efforts will achieve tangible progress in the near future. Events in Central America have shown that peace can be achieved through diplomacy and negotiation. We are confident that the leaders of the region recognize the importance of ensuring a climate of good-neighbourliness among the States of Central America that would lay the appropriate groundwork to support the efforts of the Contadora Group and implement the Esuipulas II accords so that the long-standing instability in the region may be ended.
Last year, Seoul, the capital of South Korea, witnessed a remarkable summer Olympiad that was most in harmony with the universality that also constitutes one of the major pillars of the United Nations.
In accordance with that principle, and because of the importance of such a step in alleviating tension and promoting the peace process in the peninsula, we welcome any international effort made to ensure the representation of both Koreas in our Organization and to grant them full membership.
With regard to the question of Cyprus, while we express our regret that the two parties to the conflict were unable to reach a negotiated solution to the problem last June, we nevertheless hope that the leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities will show the greatest degree of co-operation and flexibility in the coming rounds of talks, so that the members of both communities may once again live together side by side in peace, security, and tranquillity.
The dangers posed by the unsound environmental policies pursued by certain industrialized countries have given rise to a disturbance in the ecological balance, the extinction of certain plant and animal species necessary to maintain natural life on our planet and, in many regions, the pollution of the seas to a most hazardous extent.
My country, following the guidelines laid down by His Majesty Sultan Qabcos bin Said, accords the utmost importance to environmental protection. My country was and continues to be a pioneer in enacting legislation and adopting initiatives, particularly at the regional level, for the elaboration of optimum methods of solving environmental problems.
The Sultanate of Oman therefore supports the convening of the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development at the earliest possible opportunity. The conference should review and appraise achievements in the field of environmental preservation, formulate solutions to the challenges that mankind will face in that domain, and reassess priorities in such a manner as to ensure the continuity of international efforts to create a better environment for future generations.
Mankind has made unprecedented progress in opening up new horizons in technology. However, most scientific achievements are unfortunately devoted to advancing the arms race and even to the manufacture and development of devices that threaten the survival of mankind itself, such as nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
The very existence of such lethal weapons is the greatest danger threatening mankind. Therefore, any talk of halting the proliferation of such weapons is out of joint if it is not within the context of their complete elimination. It is the international community's endeavour to achieve this end that prompted it warmly to welcome and support the agreement reached between the two super-Powers at the end of 1987 on the elimination of their medium-range and shorter-range missiles from Europe as a first step towards nuclear disarmament. In that connection, we welcome the measures recently agreed upon by the two Powers with regard to disarmament.
Bilateral disarmament negotiations, although extremely important, should not detract from the role of multilateral negotiations nor be seen as a substitute for them? the two should rather complement each other. The question of disarmament is not one that concerns certain States alone. It is an issue that impinges on the interests and the very existence of all mankind. We must therefore make the greatest possible efforts to support United Nations endeavours relating to disarmament issues and especially those involving the future of mankind, such as the prevention of the outbreak of nuclear war and the imposition of a comprehensive nuclear test ban. Agreement on those questions can release enormous resources which if used in the proper manner - for development - would change the world situation and make it more secure, more peaceful and more prosperous.
It is saddening that the momentum produced by recent United Nations successes in solving regional problems has not been exploited for the achievement of corresponding progress and success at the level of the international economy.
The economies of the developing world are suffering grave problems. Average annual rates of real growth in those countries fell from 5.5 per cent in the 1970s to less than 3 per cent in the 1980s. The share of third-world countries in the developed market economies fell from 38 per cent in 1970 to only 19 per cent in 1987, while that of the industrialized countries rose from 65 per cent to 71 per cent over the same period. If to the problem of reduced income are added the indebtedness problem of the developing countries, which has now surpassed the $1 billion mark, the deterioration in the terms of trade to their detriment, the drop in the prices of the primary commodities on which the economies of those countries depend and the protectionist measures imposed, then it is abundantly clear that we remain far from achieving a better economic order that would narrow the existing economic gap between developing and developed countries.
The factors that have prevented the international community from realizing the economic achievements to which it might have aspired during the 1980s must, on the threshold of the 1990s, provide us with the strongest motivation to make the greatest possible efforts to establish a just economic order that takes account of  the economic conditions of the emerging developing countries. Among the priorities for such efforts must be the formulation of a fair and thoroughgoing solution to the debt crisis, which still threatens to undermine stability at the national and international levels. We regard the three-point plan of action, presented by the brotherly State of Kuwait and delivered by His Highness the Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah at the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly, as an important initiative that must be supported. Action should be taken to implement it in order that a solution to the international debt crisis be found. We must here commend the policy announced by the French Government absolving the least developed countries of all their debts, and we can only welcome the agreement recently reached on Mexico's debts. This constitutes an auspicious precedent with regard to the problem of indebtedness in general.
We support the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries. Such a session will provide an opportunity to initiate a dialogue on the reversal of the present downward trend in the world economy, which will only come about through a strong demonstration of collective political will, and of the belief that it is not possible for the world to live in peace if a tiny minority of the human race possesses all the attributes of affluence while the majority lacks even the most elementary requirements of life. We are living in an epoch in which the United Nations has begun to contribute with increasing effectiveness to the solution of a number of international problems, and we call for support for efforts to continue this positive momentum. We are also hopeful that, through this Organization, we will be able to devise just and peaceful solutions to the various issues which are a source of concern to the international community and which threaten international peace and security, such as the question of the Palestinian people and the conduct of the racist regime in South Africa. We further hope that increased and more earnest efforts will be made to channel the enormous scientific and technological progress being made into building a better tomorrow for future generations instead of the contrivance of ever more means of destruction.
The Sultanate of Oman believes that the United Nations has the necessary attributes to enable it to play an important role in this field, and we shall spare no effort to contribute to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.
In conclusion, we hope that the deliberations of the present session will strengthen co-operation and promote detente in international relations and that the resolutions adopted by the Assembly will be of a practical character so that they may contribute successfully to addressing the issues included in this session's agenda.
","We are prompted to make this assertion by the belief that the leaders of both countries have a strong desire for peace and that the climate of public opinion in both countries and the deep sentiments and common interests that link the peoples of Iraq and Iran are all factors that go to form a fitting backdrop for co-operation which must inevitably have a positive influence for peace. With regard to the question of Cyprus, while we express our regret that the two parties to the conflict were unable to reach a negotiated solution to the problem last June, we nevertheless hope that the leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities will show the greatest degree of co-operation and flexibility in the coming rounds of talks, so that the members of both communities may once again live together side by side in peace, security, and tranquillity. It is the international community's endeavour to achieve this end that prompted it warmly to welcome and support the agreement reached between the two super-Powers at the end of 1987 on the elimination of their medium-range and shorter-range missiles from Europe as a first step towards nuclear disarmament. If to the problem of reduced income are added the indebtedness problem of the developing countries, which has now surpassed the $1 billion mark, the deterioration in the terms of trade to their detriment, the drop in the prices of the primary commodities on which the economies of those countries depend and the protectionist measures imposed, then it is abundantly clear that we remain far from achieving a better economic order that would narrow the existing economic gap between developing and developed countries. Such a session will provide an opportunity to initiate a dialogue on the reversal of the present downward trend in the world economy, which will only come about through a strong demonstration of collective political will, and of the belief that it is not possible for the world to live in peace if a tiny minority of the human race possesses all the attributes of affluence while the majority lacks even the most elementary requirements of life."
44,1989,CIV,"ï»¿
Sir, the superb qualifications we knew you to possess, the wealth of experience you bring to international affairs and to the United Nations, your commitment to the cause of peace, and above all that of your great country, Nigeria, to which Cote d'lvoire feels bound by so many ties of friendship and co-operation, constitute for us a whole series of reasons whole heatedly  to welcome your resounding election to the presidency of this session of the General assembly. Please accept my delegation's aid my own heartfelt and fraternal congratulations and our most sincere wishes for continued success.
We also congratulate your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, who so efficiently, effectively and felicitously guided the General Assembly's work at its preceding session.
Allow me, finally, to pay a special tribute - a well-deserved tribute, indeed - to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has devoted a major part of his long and varied diplomatic career to serving and defending the noble ideals of peace and freedom, justice end progress, co-operation and solidarity embodied in the united Nations. The international community today welcomes aid reaps the fruits of his intelligence, perspicacity aid steadfast, tenacious efforts, as well as of his negotiating strength and skill and his persuasiveness, which have allowed the united Nations to restore its credibility and reaffirm itself as the focal point par excellence in the quest for the peaceful resolution of international problems. We should like to assure the Secretary-General once more of our complete confidence and unreserved support for him and for all the steps he has taken to ensure the triumph of these ideals.
This session has begun in a particularly serene international climate fostered by the dialogue, built on confidence, engaged in for the past two years by the two major world leaders, the President of the united States of America and the President of the Soviet of Soviet Socialist Republics, a dialogue we are quite appropriately assessing in terms of its beneficial effects for the international political situation.
The thick wall of fear and distrust is beginning to crumble, the dynamics of negotiation are increasingly replacing confrontation and the pitting of one side against the other, and conflicts are ebbing.
Thus we have noted with relief aid reassurance the progress - inadequate, to be sure, but none the less significant and promising - made in the realm of nuclear disarmament with the commitment of the major Powers to do all they can to eliminate, under appropriate international controls, weapons of mass destruction that continue to threaten holocaust on our poor planet. Progress is also perceptible in terms of detente between East and West in the settlement of various regional or bilateral conflicts, as well as in the progressive elimination of the political oppression that is driving peoples to take recourse to force and violence to enforce their inalienable right to decide for themselves and to live in freedom and dignity.
But this somewhat idyllic portrayal of the international situation must not lead them to overlook the darkness of the sky. At any time all of this can be called into question if we do not display enough imagination to resolve peacefully, and
once and for all, the conflicts that subsist and to find realistic ways to end the injustices that mark international economic relations and the anguish that is today the lot of the developing world.
Before sharing with the Assembly my delegation's observations on some of the principal agenda items before this session, I should like to state once again the Cote d'lvoire's deep commitment to the united Nations and our full commitment to its noble ideals, which we are seeking to transform into an effective reality day by day, both within our country and abroad.
Our unswerving fidelity to the principles we share with the united Nations does not allow us to indulge in demagogy nor to compromise our dignity on any pretext whatsoever. Let us be clear: Cote d'lvoire wants to be a friend to all. It scrupulously respects the sovereignty and dignity of others as well as their views and their approaches to various problems. Those may differ from ours, but, in the final analysis, such differences are minor, since we all have the same goal: to contribute, each in his own way, to resolving problems and to strengthening international peace and security. Is Cote d'lvoire not en titled to expect from others the same behaviour and the same respect?
We are prompted today, as we have been in the past and as we shall continue to be in the future, by the sole concern to serve the noble cause of peace, in full freedom and independence, while giving pride of place to the virtues of dialogue and negotiation and resolutely opposing anything that might eventually lead to violence and war.
Although we can justifiably welcome the climate of confidence that reigns in the world and the resultant lessening of international tensions, we must none the less recognize that certain situations still give us cause for serious concern. This is especially true in Africa, in Asia, in the Middle East and in Latin America, where the right to self-determination and the freedom to choose one's system are often put at risk or influenced by outside interference, by the hankering of some for power and by the lackey-like friendships of others.
In Africa, it is reassuring to note that the dialogue we had been recommending since 1971 as the best means of resolving all disputes and conflicts, including the intolerable situation prevailing in the southern part of the continent, is today making progress and opening positive prospects for the future in that region.
As far as the situation in South Africa in particular is concerned, it is obvious that we firmly and unreservedly condemn the abhorrent system of apartheid. However, while understanding aid supporting the struggle of our black brothers for recognition of their right to dignity, we continue to believe that dialogue and negotiation can foster understanding and mutual trust among the South African countries, and especially between the black majority and the oppressor white minority.
It is clear, as the Secretary-General has stated, that a mere dilution or softening of apartheid will not answer the expectations of the majority of the people of South Africa nor of the world as a whole. We therefore once again urge the South African authorities to take the necessary steps to create without delay a climate propitious to true dialogue in South Africa, displaying the political courage required to eliminate, once and for all, the inhuman policy of apartheid that is preventing the harmonious evolution of South African society and compromising South Africa's relations with its neighbours, with Africa aid with the outside world.
In this connection they must give still more tangible proofs of their resolve to turn the sad page of apartheid by unconditionally freeing Nelson Mandela, whose continued house arrest is totally without justification? by freeing all political detainees* and by granting freedom of expression to those movements opposed to apartheid. Lastly, we urge them to enter into dialogue with the black majority and to build the South Africa of tomorrow, a democratic, egalitarian and fraternal South Africa in which South Africans of ail races, backgrounds and faiths can live in peace, freedom and harmony within their common homeland, whose future they will guarantee and ensure together in a united Africa.
Cote d'lvoire strongly urges the South African leadership to commit itself resolutely to that path, for the peace and concord of their country are at stake. It is up to them, and to them alone, to create the conditions for that indispensable dialogue, to which, we are convinced, our black brothers will be receptive. The Brazzaville and New York agreements entered into on 22 December 1988 by Angola, Cuba ad South Africa, with the mediation of the united Sates of America and the discreet but no-less-effective contribution of the Soviet Union, have made it possible to clear away the obstacles that have been preventing the effective implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia ad to faster the peaceful settlement of the situation in Angola.
We welcome that. We express the hope that the process of Namibian independence may be concluded without further setbacks or intimidation so that free, regular and democratic elections may be held to enable the Namibian people finally to win back their full sovereignty ad their proper place in the concert of free nations.
Despite years of heroic struggle against Portuguese colonialism our Angolan brothers are still, regrettably, not at peace, owing to the fratricidal war that is still unfortunately raging in their country after 14 years of hard-won independence. We welcome the 22 June 1989 Gbadolite declaration,- in which the Angola leaders have proclaimed to the world their determination to put an ad to that lengthy civil war. A process of national reconciliation and negotiation has finally, after many ups and downs and fratricidal confrontations, made it possible to glimpse the outlines of a settlement to the dispute between Chad aid Libya, with the normalization in 1988 of relations between the two countries and the conclusion of the Algiers framework agreement of 31 August 1989.
An era of understanding, tolerance, co-operation and renewed friendship between those two countries has thus been entered, in the best interest of their peoples. We pay tribute to all who have contributed to this happy outcome.
With regard to the situation in certain countries in eastern and southern Africa, we welcome the relaxation of tension in those areas and the readiness of the Governments concerned to enter into talks with their opposite numbers aid their neighbours to restore peace and concord in their countries and to improve good-neighbourly relations.
In Western Sahara the tireless efforts of the united Nations Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) have led to acceptance by the parties to the dispute, with certain reservations, of the proposed peace plan. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for having set up at united Nations Headquarters a technical commission to put the finishing touches on ways and means of implementing that plan which should enable the people of Western Sahara to determine their own fate through general and regular elections.
we were grieved by the painful conflict that has recently caused a deterioration in relations between two fraternal countries, Senegal and Mauritania, with which we have solid ties of friendship and co-operation, both bilaterally in the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA) and in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We urge the Governments of those two countries to do all they can to promote the normalization of the many-faceted relationships their close proximity demands, in the interests of peace between their peoples aid of peace and co-operation in our sub region.
In this connection we support the mediation efforts of the current Chairman of the OAU to achieve a peaceful aid just solution of that conflict on the basis of OAU charter principles.
Other hotbeds of tension continue to command our attention. In the Middle East we feel that the situation will remain alarming so long as a peaceful political solution is not found to the Palestinian question, which is the core of the problem. To achieve such a solution, we have affirmed that to be lasting and viable any peaceful settlement in the Middle East must take into consideration the two inescapable realities of the region - the Israeli reality and the Palestinian reality. Reciprocal acknowledgement of these realities will create the climate of confidence necessary for the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue needed to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem.
I should like to take this opportunity to specify that my country was the first to proclaim, here from this very rostrum a few years ago, that the Palestinian question had to be considered and dealt with not only in terms of humanitarian concerns and of assistance to refugees driven from their land, but had also to be viewed as an essentially political problem to which a political solution must be found to put an end to the spiral of violence and to restore peace in the region.
Given the imperative of peace, it was for us a matter of doing justice to the Palestinian people by responding to their legitimate aspirations: the free exercise of the right to self-determination and independence and recognition of their right to a homeland separate and independent from other States in the region whose existence - including that of Israel - will be assured and guaranteed.
After many twists and turns, things have evolved to the point where today we can legitimately entertain the hope that the aspirations of that people will soon be achieved.
The proclamation in Algiers in 1988 of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council falls into the logical trend we have been recommending for some time.
We take note of the decisive steps taken in this connection by the Palestinian Command and its leaders who, in endorsing Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), have displayed their readiness for dialogue to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem. We hope that the Israelis, for their part, will overcome their distrust and decide that dialogue is still possible with the Palestinians - the very people with whom they will one day have to coexist harmoniously on the land of Palestine they share.
Hence Cote d'lvoire is in favour of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation, beyond that of the permanent members of the Security Council, of all the patties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), to take stock of the situation as a whole and consider the various plans put forward in order to give peace a chance in a region that needs it so much. Such a conference will, we hope, make it possible to arrive at an overall, just and lasting settlement of the situation in the Middle East, a settlement that will put an aid to the state of belligerence that has prevailed there for more than four decades and make it possible for Israeli troops to withdraw from occupied Arab territories, while guaranteeing the right of the State of Israel to exist and to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, along with the national rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to a free and independent homeland with equally secure and recognized borders, with all the political and juridical consequences flowing there from. We have maintained aid continue to maintain at the highest levels the most useful contacts with the PLO and its leadership and with other States in the region. We intend to pursue them in the interests of peace and harmony in tine Middle East.
In this quest for peace in that part of the world so dear to us all, how could we not cry out in indignation in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in Lebanon, where a tolerant, engaging and ingenious people, because of divisiveness in its midst - something that invites foreign intervention - is being decimated by blind violence and dying. We endorse the appeals for a cessation of hostilities and an end to the brutal bombardment that is destroying human life and the infrastructure of the country. We support the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the League of Arab States to ensure that the guns fall silent and that negotiations begin among the Lebanese communities - of all political parties and all religious faiths - in order to define the basis for peaceful and fraternal coexistence within a reconciled Lebanon which would thus regain its unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.
Finally, we should like to stress the great merit of all those belligerents who have had the courage to renounce force and overcome rancour and hatred in order to sit down at the negotiating table and join in dialogue with a view to putting an end to the conflicts in which they were involved. Their courage has made it possible to achieve satisfactory results in the quest for peace in the world. Thus, the Geneva Agreements of 14 April 1988 made it possible for Soviet troops to withdraw from Afghanistan and the definitive settlement of this conflict now hinges cm scrupulous respect by the signatories for the provisions of these Agreements.
Acceptance by Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 28 July 1987 and the cease-fire that entered into force on 20 August 1988 should, with the mediation of the united Nations Secretary-General, facilitate direct dialogue between the two countries with a view to settling the remaining questions and making it possible for them to normalize their relations.
My country welcomes the peace and co-operation agreements entered into by the countries of Central America, in particular the agreement signed recently at Tela, Honduras. We support steps taken by the Contadora aid Support Groups with a view to establishing democracy and peace in that part of the world, free from any foreign interference.
We encourage the resumption of dialogue between the two Koreas aimed at the peaceful reunification proclaimed in the Paimunjom declaration of 4 July 1972. We can see only advantages in having these two countries, with which we maintain excellent relations, becoming fully fledged Members of the Organization, something which could contribute to fostering this dialogue. Such a request from them would naturally receive our backing.
We also support in Cyprus the dialogue between the Cypriot communities to restore the sovereignty, unity aid territorial integrity of that Member State aid guarantee its non-aligned status.
With regard to Cambodia, the holding of the Paris international conference opened up new prospects in the process of restoring peace aid achieving reconciliation in that country. That process will be greatly facilitated by ending interference in the internal affairs of Cambodia, notably by the effective withdrawal under appropriate international control of Vietnamese troops, something that would reassure the Cambodian opposition and leave it up to the Cambodians of all persuasions to settle their own problems by way of fraternal and confident dialogue.
As President Houphouet-Boigny is wont to say, peace is one and indivisible. It is over-arching, all-encompassing aid inseparable from development. Hence there can be no peace in the world if only one region enjoys peace and is awash in opulence while others are ravaged by war end plunged into poverty which is gaining more and more ground. That is why we believe that, while we must strive as hard as we can to consolidate peace where it is most fragile or most threatened and restore it where it has been destroyed, we must also put an end to the inequities and economic difficulties with which many of us are confronted so that we can equally enjoy the benefits of freedom and peace, the very basis of development.
While we may now applaud the improvement in the international political climate - and we hope that it will continue - we must none the less recognize that the same is not true of international economic relations. The world economic situation is marked by an ever-widening gap between the developed countries and the developing countries, by the continued growth of the economies of the North, contrasting sharply with the great deterioration of the economies of the South, and by the imbalance in trade between a North that is getting richer and a South that is steadily growing poorer. That is caused by, among other things, the inexorable fall in the prices of raw materials, the constant worsening of the terms of trade and the heavy debt burden, which, in the final analysis, means a net negative transfer of capital from the South to the North.
The situation is particularly worrying for the African countries facing economic and financial difficulties so serious that their economic aid social structures, so patiently built up, are in danger of crumbling. If energetic measures are not taken to allow those countries to resist the trend and at least to subsist, they will be plunged into anarchy, disorder and instability, threatening the social peace that is vital to ensure their development. It is our duty to ensure that that does not happen.
Explaining his thoughts on the matter, President Houphouet-Boigny said recently in Dakar, at the francophone Summit, that just as
'the man who is hungry is not free, a country that does not lead a normal life because its economy is in danger, it has a crushing debt burden, its trade is threatened and its modest resources are shamelessly exploited - in brief, a poor country that is kept in that state by speculation - is not a free country.'
That is indeed the reality of our situation in Africa today. Our political independence and our freedom, so dearly bought, will have no true dealing if they are not based on genuine economic development.
It is true that over recent years our Governments have made remarkable efforts and have begun enormous reform programmes to bring us out of our present difficulties and pursue our growth. Unfortunately, the results have not met our expectations and our situation continues dangerously to become worse.
The reasons are simple. We live in a hostile economic climate, because of the selfishness of the developed countries, with their increased protectionism, and the mentality of those whose only motivation is easy profits and who, to their shame, are becoming richer simply through speculation. Those people are playing with the fruits of the labour of our courageous peoples, to whose fate they are totally indifferent.
Such speculation deprives us of important resources needed to finance our development, to meet our external commitments aid to make available to our young people, in this computer age, training in the citadels of knowledge, science, technical skills and the technology that will allow us successfully to meet the great challenge of underdevelopment and contributing to bringing about a new international economic order that is more just and equitable.
Cote d'lvoire has made great strides along the path of development, through its own efforts and with the valuable help of friendly countries and international financial and monetary organizations. It has also been helped in this by the climate of peace and the resulting political stability. But that development is handicapped today by the drastic losses we are suffering in the export of our main agricultural products, as a result of speculation.
In what follows we are not telling anybody anything new. That is especially true of those present who are familiar with the problem or who are also suffering from it. But it is good to put the matter in perspective by revealing that in three years our country lost nearly $9 billion on its products. Over the same period it paid out more than 36 billion to reschedule its external debt, whose repayment it has had to suspend. That was not because we would not pay, but because we could not.
When one thinks of the enormous profits reaped in the developed countries on products such as coffee and cocoa, one is entitled to ask what kind of peace with justice we are seeking to bring about in the world.
The agonizing debt problem, which has been the subject of a number of international meetings, has again occupied an important place in this debate. It has done so for the simple reason that we must find a solution giving hope of dispelling the uncertainties hanging over the future of the countries particularly affected.
We consider that the debt results from the inequality in international trade; the reason is essentially to be found at that level.
We fully support the technical solutions suggested in the various proposals, initiatives or plans put forward recently as a result of efforts to think about this thorny problem and find realistic, satisfactory solutions, such as the outright cancellation of some of the debts, a lightening, rescheduling or partial reduction of others and of their servicing and the granting of separate supplementary facilities to provide financial aid on concessionary terms to developing countries, particularly medium-income African countries. We pay tribute to the developed countries that have already taken steps in that regard by deciding to cancel or reduce the debts owed them certain developing countries.
However, we believe that proper importance should be attached to the question of fair payment for raw materials. Is it possible to conceive of a global strategy that fails to ensure just remuneration for those materials and to guarantee the stabilization of the export earnings from them, in order to resolve the debt problem? The North-South dialogue, which we all hope will be resumed in order to
introduce ethics into international trade, should consider that question, which is vital for some of us.
The idea of lasting development, which is defined in the Brundtland report, is to foster harmony between man aid his environment. It therefore assumes that concerns about a good environment will be integrated within the development process. That is imperative for both rich aid poor countries, for development cannot be carried out at the cost of the degradation of the environment and the destruction of ecological balances. Therefore, the protection of the environment and any development strategy must be interrelated in such a way as to meet the needs of the present without jeopardizing future generations.
The United Nations conference on environment and development, to be held in 1992, will give an opportunity for in-depth debate on the question aid for us all to become aware of our national and collective responsibilities with regard to the environment. It was in that spirit that Cote d'lvoire took part at the highest level in March 1989 in the conference on the environment held at The Hague, and signed the Declaration that was adopted.
Drug trafficking, yet another scourge today crossing all borders and threatening the future of our youth, requires an international strategy to fight it, a strategy such as that defined in the Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, concluded in Vienna on 20 December 1988 and submitted to States for ratification. The real fight against drugs must not be confined to increased action against traffickers end users* it also requires incentives to producers to devote themselves more to the production of legal, healthy cash crops, yielding enough profit for them to give up the growing of deadly herbs and plants.
I could not end this statement without recalling the important united Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) International Congress on Peace in the Minds of Men, held from 26 June to 1 July this year in Yamoussoukro, capital of Cote d'lvoire, on the happy initiative of Mr. Federico Mayor Zaragoza, the Director General of UNESCO. The preamble to UNESCO's constitution states:
'since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed'.
Personalities of diverse backgrounds, training and faith met in Cote d'lvoire to consider the matter together and propose programmes of action to attain the noble goal of contributing to the search for peace and its defence, to define its outlines and the necessary conditions for it aid to make the international community aware that peace is mankind's most precious possession and that all man's activities must be devoted to preserving it at all costs. The Yamoussoukro Declaration, the fruit of their reflection, embodied aid articulated their faith in a promising future for mankind, a future that we must build patiently within a new and all-encompassing vision of peace, by adopting, at the level of each of us, of our Governments and of our respective peoples, a behaviour which would effectively ensure peace in the world through the triumph of freedom over oppression, of justice over inequity, of solidarity over egoism, of respect for human rights, above all the right to live, over the disregard of such rights, of shared good fortune over regionalized poverty, in brief, full material and spiritual realization for people in a sound environment, with people thus freed at last from the uncertainties of tomorrow.
Cote d'lvoire intends, for its part, to strive tirelessly for that peaces peace in the hearts and minds of all people.

Sir, the superb qualifications we knew you to possess, the wealth of experience you bring to international affairs and to the United Nations, your commitment to the cause of peace, and above all that of your great country, Nigeria, to which Cote d'lvoire feels bound by so many ties of friendship and co-operation, constitute for us a whole series of reasons whole heatedly  to welcome your resounding election to the presidency of this session of the General assembly. We fully support the technical solutions suggested in the various proposals, initiatives or plans put forward recently as a result of efforts to think about this thorny problem and find realistic, satisfactory solutions, such as the outright cancellation of some of the debts, a lightening, rescheduling or partial reduction of others and of their servicing and the granting of separate supplementary facilities to provide financial aid on concessionary terms to developing countries, particularly medium-income African countries. The United Nations conference on environment and development, to be held in 1992, will give an opportunity for in-depth debate on the question aid for us all to become aware of our national and collective responsibilities with regard to the environment. Personalities of diverse backgrounds, training and faith met in Cote d'lvoire to consider the matter together and propose programmes of action to attain the noble goal of contributing to the search for peace and its defence, to define its outlines and the necessary conditions for it aid to make the international community aware that peace is mankind's most precious possession and that all man's activities must be devoted to preserving it at all costs.

Mr. ADODO (Togo): Mr. President, the Togolese delegation is particularly gratified at your unanimous election to preside over the work of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Apart from your great qualities as a diplomat who is versed in the affairs of our Organization, the historical ties, marked by friendly cooperation and active solidarity, which link Nigeria with Togo are all reasons why the Togolese delegation will offer you its support and full and frank co-operation as you carry out your new duties.
Allow me to pay a tribute also to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, who directed the work of the forty-third session with remarkable skill and competence and to the entire satisfaction of the Togolese delegation. I once again warmly congratulate him. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, faithful to himself as well as to the principles and purposes of the United Nations, during the forty-third session took a number of timely initiatives that strengthened the chances for peace and restored the credibility as well as the effectiveness of our universal Organization. It is therefore a very pleasant duty for me once again to offer the Secretary-General the warm congratulations of the Government of Togo on the dynamic, effective and devoted way in which he has been discharging his responsibilities.
In its activities designed to bring about general and complete disarmament with effective verification machinery, the international community has assigned the main responsibility to the two major Powers. The implementation of the Treaty on medium-range nuclear weapons, the ongoing negotiations to reduce strategic arsenals by one half, the phased ban on nuclear-weapons tests, the stepping up of negotiations to conclude an international convention totally banning chemical weapons all provide further opportunities for action and for peace.
In this connection, the regional centres of the United Nations for peace and disarmament should be confirmed as the privileged purveyors of information and training to all those who, because of the responsibilities entrusted to them, may have some influence on the maintenance of international peace and security. My country, Togo, which is honoured to be the host country for the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, hopes that that Centre will be able very soon to contribute, through its activities, to increasing confidence among the States of the continent and concerting their efforts to promote peace.
Peace, which our Organization holds so dear, remains precarious in many regions of Asia, America and Africa, with regard to Asia, the agreement which is being sought within the context of the International Conference on Cambodia must necessarily take account of all those concerns in order to ensure the unity and national reconciliation which is the best possible way of safeguarding the independence and integrity of that long-ravaged country. In that connection, the recent informal ministerial meetings in Jakarta and the diplomatic meetings in Paris are positive contributions to the process of re-establishing peace in Cambodia. We also believe that the withdrawal of foreign troops and direct negotiation among the parties will be likely to pave the way to a peaceful solution.
A global and lasting settlement of the Afghan question requires that all Parties to the conflict make sincere efforts towards creating conditions favouring the return of the refugees and bringing about national reconciliation. It is therefore incumbent upon the four signatory countries to the Geneva Agreements to act together to prevent any further foreign interference imperilling the efforts that have been made up till now to put an end to hostilities in that country.
The conflict between Iran and Iraq, because of its length, its breadth and the inherent risk of its spreading internationally, has created one of the deepest breaches in the activities of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, it is therefore very gratifying that the joint initiatives of the Security Council and the Secretary-General led to the acceptance by the two States of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The cessation of hostilities, beginning on 20 August 1988, should therefore he utilized to reach a negotiated settlement that is just and acceptable to all.
The same objective should be sought in the Korean peninsula. This is why we would encourage the leaders of the two States to pursue, without relenting, the dialogue they initiated to determine what measures should be taken to increase trust between them and to achieve the final objective of the peaceful reunification of their countries. This reunification, the modalities of which are to be determined by that negotiation, seems to us to be an essential component of political stability in that region.
In Central America the peace initiatives, in particular the Arias Plan, have confirmed the commitment of the States in that region to settle the crisis developing there themselves without any outside interference. The Esquipulas Agreements have laid the groundwork for such a situation. Those recently concluded at Costa del Sol and Tela by the five Central American Heads of State quite judiciously determined the context and conditions for peace in that region. All these initiatives deserve the active support of our Organization.
In Western Sahara, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, alter having on 30 August 1988 stated their agreement to the referendum on the self-determination of the Sahraoui people presented by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, have in this connection established a dialogue of which we expect a great deal, above all that it will speed up the peace process. All efforts should therefore be focused to that end so as to avoid the widespread resumption of hostilities which would once more involve considerable loss of human life.
The crisis that has beset the Middle East for some decades now has in recent weeks witnessed developments which have caused us all concern and demonstrated that no viable solution is possible without a settlement of the Palestinian problem, which is its real crux. The Togolese Government very early recognized the new Palestinian State. By so doing we wished to reaffirm our unflagging support for the right of peoples to self-determination, freedom and independence.
In this connection the establishment of a dialogue between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO) and the United States Government is a positive element in the process of a Middle East settlement. My country believes that everything should be done to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties, including the PLO, so that a settlement could be reached as soon as possible that would guarantee the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as well as the rights of all peoples in the region, including Israel, to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.
Today, more than ever before, we must reach out to one another through open and constructive dialogue. We have to avoid the pointless and absurd suffering that is being inflicted on peoples who are living every day in an atmosphere of fear, anguish and death in the Middle East.
Lebanon has until recently been the living embodiment of this daily tragedy a to a certain extent has constituted a denial of the purposes and principles of our Organization. Today the weapons have fallen silent. Hope has been reborn, thanks to the timely mediation of the Arab League and the co-operation of the parties to the conflict. The Togolese Government welcomes the cease-fire agreement an would like to express the hope that this initial step will in a non-violent way led to peace and political stability, without which none of the problems facing this courageous people can be resolved in an appropriate way. 
The recent development of the situation in southern Africa, particularly in connection with the coming independence of Namibia, warrants a certain degree of optimism. First, it is becoming more and more obvious that peace and reconciliation in Angola are essential to stability throughout the region. They are likewise essential to strengthening the forthcoming independence of Namibia. Therefore it is essential that the efforts made by the African Heads of State at Gbadolite, Hat ire and elsewhere to promote peace and reconciliation in Angola as well as for the independence of Namibia be fully crowned with success.  In southern Africa the black majority, determined to write the glorious pages of its own history, has demanded, through powerful and peaceful demonstrations, that apartheid be dismantled, that the Exception Laws be revoked, and Mandela be I reed. All peace- and justice-loving nations must step up their economic, financial and political pressure on a regime that, since Mr. de Klerk came to power, has changed its speeches but not its policies. The ambiguity of language from the new leaders of Pretoria reveals the impossibility of reforming in any way this absurd system based on contempt and injustice.
Turning now to Namibia, no one can underestimate the dangers besetting the new State which, throughout the long history of decolonization, is the only one to have had a common frontier with its erstwhile colonizer. This is why no support should be denied the Secretary-General in order that he might take all the measures necessary to ensure free, regular and democratic elections for the genuine independence of that country.
International economic relations today remain profoundly inequitable and place upon the weaker economies numerous and increasingly untenable constraints. The developing countries, in their desire to broaden the North-South dialogue, had our General Assembly adopt two basic documents: first, the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order; and secondly, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. These two texts were intended to serve as a framework and as guidance in international economic co-operation. Although these documents had been adopted by a double consensus in the General Assembly, that was not sufficient to impose the necessary reforms on the international economic system which they contained. Thus, in particular, the targets set for the Third United Nations Development Decade are today very far from having been reached.
During the 1980s the disruption of commodity prices, the steady deterioration in the terms of trade, the growth in protectionism, the inevitable rise of debt and the general shrinkage of financial flows to the developing countries have resulted in the latter's finding themselves in a vicious circle which they find it difficult to break out of.
 In the middle of the present decade, average real commodity prices had reached the lowest level ever recorded since the great depression of the 1930s. The African countries, which are heavily dependent on their primary exports, have been Particularly hard hit by the drop in world prices, in 1987-1988 the prices of cocoa, copper, wood, iron and so forth were more than 30 per cent lower than those in 1980. Earnings from these commodities correspondingly fell at a time when our countries, faced with ever increasing and more urgent social demands and economic constraints, continued to founder in a state of chronic and absurd indebtedness. Today this external debt has taken such a place in the concerns of states that it is concealing the real problems of development in the third world. Undoubtedly specific measures have recently been taken by States and institutions to alleviate the burden of debt of a number of countries in the third world, and here we should like to express our profound gratitude to those countries which, in an upsurge of solidarity, have waived either totally or partially the public credits they held in the case of Togo.
Nevertheless it must be emphasized that solution of the crisis of indebtedness necessarily involves raising the value of commodities. if the developing countries do not receive remunerative prices for their commodities they will very shortly reach a situation of profound disequilibrium that must lead to the crippling indebtedness which we deplore so much today. Indeed, as long as there is a reverse flow of resources and as long as external financial flows do not increase substantially towards the poor countries of the third world, those countries will be doomed to stagnation and to impoverishment.
The developed and the developing countries should mobilize their efforts both in thought and deed so that in a fresh spirit of solidarity new solutions can be found not only to the debt problem but, more generally, to ensure the specific implementation of the measures adopted, first by the General Assembly, such as the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, and, secondly, by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the other agencies of the United Nations system.
It is very important now to rethink international economic co-operation in terms of a judicious restructuring of the world economic order. That is why my country attaches major importance to two forthcoming events, namely, the special session of the General Assembly to further economic growth and development, and the drawing up of a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade. Both events should provide an opportunity to remedy the inequities of the international economic system end to promote a just and equitable division of the heritage of mankind. The detente that we are now experiencing will be fragile and precarious if it does not have a specific economic content for the developing countries, that is to say, new and real possibilities for development and progress.
Similarly, international co-operation must be strengthened in the matter of the protection of the environment. Overt or covert attempts to bury toxic wastes in Africa could ultimately result in sowing death, desolation and squalor among our peoples. That is why we must join our efforts and bear in mind that the struggle to prevent the deterioration of the environment is an integral part of what should be done by the international community to promote economic growth and development.
In order to thwart these nefarious manoeuvres, the Government of Togo in the matter of the protection of the environment has drawn up a code that is stringent both in the standards it defines and the sanctions it lays down.
The same stringency and intransigence should be observed with regard to the Production of, trafficking in, and consumption of drugs - a scourge whose effects will in the final analysis be lethal for all societies, whether rich or poor.
Likewise, the acts of terrorism perpetrated here and there, whether carried out by organized groups or isolated individuals, should be firmly condemned and fought against unflaggingly. Absolutely nothing can excuse the loss of innocent life for causes which would be better served by open and constructive dialogue, even if that dialogue is difficult to achieve.
The growing interdependence among the various participants on the international scene is today a reality none can evade.
In the same way that political tensions, poverty and squalor are becoming more generalized, economic and social difficulties and the unrelenting deterioration of the environment are threatening the capacity of States fully to enjoy their national and international sovereignty and thus to make an effective contribution to the advent of a world of peace. Like conflicts, natural catastrophes and the depletion of financial resources that is linked to massive external indebtedness may seriously undermine the independence and sovereignty of States and, hence, their security and international peace.
During the decade that is coming to and end, we have witnessed a number of grey areas in our joint efforts to promote the well-being of our peoples and to give concrete expression to the ideals of justice, freedom and solidarity. That is why it is important for us to work even harder to impart full vitality and urgency to the concept of solidarity, which is at the crossroads of the major moral and spiritual values that can give our world new reasons for living and making progress together. It is in this way that the forthcoming decade can be one of renewal, that is, a time when we shall come to realize fully that we share a common destiny so that the twenty-first century may usher in a more peaceful world, a world that is more secure and more favourable to the further blossoming of mankind in every aspect.
","The implementation of the Treaty on medium-range nuclear weapons, the ongoing negotiations to reduce strategic arsenals by one half, the phased ban on nuclear-weapons tests, the stepping up of negotiations to conclude an international convention totally banning chemical weapons all provide further opportunities for action and for peace.

44,1989,CYP,"ï»¿
I should like first of all to offer you. Sir, my warm congratulations on taking up the presidency of the General assembly and to express my deep thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his work. I should like also to express our esteem and appreciation for the excellent work of the Secretary-General - whose thoughtful and informative report we have read with great interest - in conducting the affairs and promoting the goals of the United Nations.
When we gathered at the United Nations this time last year we all spoke with hope of the dawning of a new, more peaceful epoch in international affairs. Political developments of momentous significance in the intervening 12 months have confirmed our hopes of a new era. At the same time, we have become aware of the many challenges raised by this era, which must be met effectively before our positive expectations and aspirations can be fully realized.
Relations between the two major super-Powers - the bellwether for a general amelioration of the international political climate - have continued to improve at a quickening pace, surpassing our expectations. The momentous importance of the shift from confrontation to co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union can hardly be overestimated. As a result of the opportunity for dialogue on an expanded agenda created by this new positive climate, there is today a marked overall improvement in East-West relations. A long list of disarmament accords, which a few years ago seemed unattainable, have been concluded, while the prospects for the ongoing East-West talks on conventional force reductions, chemical weapons and strategic offensive weapons have been greatly enhanced, particularly following this month's successful meeting in Wyoming between Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze and Mr . James Baker.
We are encouraged by the proposal made by President George Bush at the General Assembly for cuts of at least 80 per cent in the super-Power chemical-weapons arsenals, with the aim of a total ban on such weapons within 10 years of the signing of a multilateral chemical-weapons treaty, and by the very positive response of the Soviet Union.
Reflecting the shift from confrontation to co-operation in super-Power relations, a number of conflicts at diverse points on the globe are now on the path to peaceful resolution.
Namibia is now firmly launched on the road to independence. The personal involvement of the Secretary-General has contributed decisively to the Namibia independence process, which represents a key success for the United Nations.
We also welcome the continued progress towards the resolution of the dispute in Western Sahara, on the basis of the peace plan presented by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) just over one year ago.
In Central America, we applaud the stepping up of efforts by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua for the implementation of the Esquipulas II Agreement. We strongly support the help being provided by the United Nations towards the consolidation of democracy and an end to foreign interference in the region.
The optimism generated by these positive developments, however, is tempered by the conflicts and problems that continue to afflict other parts of the world.
In Afghanistan, despite the 1988 Geneva Accords, the civil war continues unabated, causing immense bloodshed and hardship among the people of that country. It is time that outside interference was converted into genuine interest in bringing peace and reconciliation to Afghanistan. The Afghan people need tools with which to reconstruct their country, not weapons with which to continue destroying it.
We also regret the stalemate in the Paris Conference on Cambodia. The unilateral withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces has opened the way to a peaceful settlement. We urge all the parties concerned not to use the impasse in the peace negotiations as an opportunity to launch a new round of fighting, which would inflict fresh bloodshed and suffering on the Cambodian people.
The implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  on the conflict between Iran and Iraq in large measure still eludes us, although the cease-fire agreed upon in 1988 remains in place and the loss of human lives has ended, lasting peace in the region depends on full agreement on the interpretation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) aid on its implementation.
In the Middle East, the interrelated problems of Palestine and the Lebanon are of particular concern to Cyprus, in that their resolution is vital to peace in the region. We support the launching of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, and regret strongly the deteriorating situation in the occupied territories, where the Israeli authorities continue to react to the intifadah with killings,  and detentions on an increasingly large scale. We stress the need for effective negotiations based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), taking fully into account the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to live in peace in their own homeland.
We congratulate President Arafat on the statesmanship displayed in the historic decisions for a just aid comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian problem which would both recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people and guarantee the security of all States in the region. The people of Israel â themselves victims of centuries of persecution - must recognize the futility of a policy that denies the aspiration of an entire people to live in their own homeland in peace and dignity.
We are appalled by the tragedy of Lebanon and the enormous suffering of its people. We welcome the return to peace and the halt of Lebanon's disintegration, as a result of the efforts of the Arab League and of the Tripartite Committee on Lebanon. Cyprus has provided all possible humanitarian assistance to the large numbers of Lebanese fleeing the country in recent months. We hope that all the parties in Lebanon will realize the futility of war and will join forces in reconstituting their country.
In South Africa, the racist system of apartheid has run its course - condemned by the international community not only as unjust but also as anachronistic. We cautiously welcome certain trends towards the dismantling of apartheid following the recent elections in South Africa, and hope for the speedy release of all political prisoners, the lifting of restrictions on political activity, and the restoration of freedom of speech aid movement. We should like to join the Secretary-General, however, in warning that a partial easing of the abhorrent system of apartheid will not solve the problem of South Africa, either in the eyes of the world or in the eyes of its people. Justice will be done fully only when apartheid is dismantled fully. The gravity of a problem must be measured not only in terms of the size of the territory or the number of people affected but also in terms of the principles involved. The Cyprus problem, viewed from the standpoint of principle, is an enormous moral problem, a clear case of breach of the accepted norms of international behaviour and of grave violations of the United Nations Charter, the Organization's resolutions on Cyprus and the rule of law.
Cyprus has been subjected to invasion and occupation, forced displacement of one third of its population and massive colonization by citizens of the invading country: Turkey. There are 1,619 people who are still missing and all efforts to trace them have met with Turkish uncooperativeness. In recalling these facts, I do not intend to exchange recriminations with our powerful neighbour, Turkey? it is simply a matter of putting the Cyprus problem in perspective.
Motivated by a sincere desire to put an end to the suffering of the people of Cyprus - Greek and Turkish - I expressed, soon after my election, my readiness to meet with Prime Minister Ozal of Turkey or with the President, General Evren, since certain aspects of the Cyprus problem, such as the presence of Turkish occupation troops and settlers, can be resolved only by Ankara, unfortunately Turkey has so far not accepted my proposal.
At the same time we were happy to begin substantive talks with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Rauf Denktash, on the basis of a procedure proposed by the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. More than 80 hours of talks with Mr. Denktash in the presence of the Secretary-General's Representative and three joint meetings in New York with the Secretary-General himself culminated, last Jute, in a set of ideas that Mr. Perez de Cuellar presented to the two sides as food for thought in further negotiations. In presenting those ideas the Secretary-General was acting fully within the mandate conferred upon him by the Security Council.
Mr. Denktash's reaction was to reject the agreed negotiating procedure aid to challenge the mandated role of the Secretary-General. Mr. Denktash's position, also reflected in a resolution he secured from the so-called Turkish Cypriot Assembly, which was rejected by Turkish Cypriot opposition leaders, who we believe represent the majority opinion within their community, sets the withdrawal of the Secretary-General's ideas as a precondition for the resumption of talks.
It is characteristic that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey in his address yesterday referred to this resolution, but he failed to inform the Assembly that it demanded the withdrawal of the Secretary-General's ideas and that it laid down all sorts of pre-conditions.
Mr. Denktash, through this resolution, also in effect rejects the 1977 high-level agreements reached by him aid Presidents Makarios and Ryprianou, which have been accepted by both sides as the basis for the current negotiations. Whereas those agreements provide for a unified federated Cyprus, Mr. Denktash is now demanding a separate state as a pre-condition for further dialogue. Whereas the high-level agreements support the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the citizens of the Republic, Mr. Denktash envisages an apartheid regime in Cyprus with the complete segregation of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in two separate enclaves.
Coupled with the further hardening of the Turkish attitude in the talks, there have been threats aid attempts to settle Muslims from Bulgaria in the occupied area of Cyprus. Those developments are aimed at creating new fait accompli that would seriously undermine the efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem. They also raise serious questions as to whether the objective of the Turkish side, rather than a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem, may not in fact be the legitimisation of the present division and occupation of nearly 40 per cent of Cyprus. Yesterday the Foreign Minister of Turkey called this occupied territory 'Turkish Cypriot'. This is indicative of Turkey's thinking. This territory is Cypriot territory. It belongs to all Cypriots, especially those who had lived there in ancestral homes for generations before they were expelled by the brute force of Turkey's military might.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey also alluded to the Republic's purchases of arms. What does Turkey expect us to do? Should we sit idle while they amass 35,000 troops, 300 modern tanks and other sophisticated equipment? We acquired defensive equipment including 16 tanks, for 10,000 to 12,000 young conscripts. Time and again we offered, in fact demanded, the demilitarisation of Cyprus.
I challenge the Turkish Government; let is demilitarise Cyprus. Withdraw your 35,000 troops and we shall at the same time disband our forces and dispose of all our arms. Moreover, I reiterate the offer I made last year before the Assembly to use the funds released thereby for the development of Cyprus, especially for the Turkish-Cypriot community which has fallen behind.
We stress that we do not, cannot and will not accept the status quo as a solution to the Cyprus problem. A situation in which human rights are violated, communities are forcibly segregated on ethnic and religious lines, and territory occupied by a foreign Power is neither just nor a guarantee against future conflicts. Nor can the status quo be accepted as a solution to the Cyprus problem by the international community, for all nations are acutely conscious of the destabilizing potential of legitimising the invasion and occupation of the territory of one sovereign State by the armies of another. It is particularly regrettable that the Turkish side is taking such a negative position at a time of progress in resolving regional problems world-wide, after a year of hard work in the negotiations which, with the assistance of the Secretary-General and his representatives, demonstrated that a solution to the Cyprus problem is feasible.
The outlines of such a solution are clear. Cyprus would be federally organized and each community would have one region under its administration. The human rights of all citizens and the cultural identity aid economic well-being of both communities would be safeguarded. We have proposed that the Republic of Cyprus should be demilitarised and this, together with the federal provisions, leaves no room for anxiety on the part of the Turkish Cypriots regarding their security. The Republic as a whole, however, should also be secure. This means that there is no room in the Cyprus we are working to build for the presence of foreign troops or for unilateral rights of intervention by Turkey. A solution to the Cyprus problem is possible. Now more than ever we count on our friends in the international community not to allow impediments to be placed in its way.
lb sum up, we can say that the new climate of confidence between the two super-Powers has effectively reversed the post-war trend towards regional conflicts and proxy wars. It has imposed significant restraints on the outbreak of new hostilities and transferred many disputes from the battlefield to the negotiating table. We are, however, still looking forward to the day when confidence between the superâPowers will have become great enough to give the various peace efforts under way the last decisive push towards their successful completion.
The United Nations has an invaluable role to play in fulfilling the arduous task of settling problems and bringing peace to war-torn areas of the globe. We are gratified to note that as a result of the recent progress towards the resolution of conflicts four new peace-keeping operations have been launched in the last three years and an additional three are currently being actively considered. We strongly support the Secretary-General's recommendations for the strengthening of the role of the united Nations in order to boost compliance with the Organization's decisions and make the united Nations an effective agent for the prevention, and not just the termination, of conflicts. The States members of the Non-Aligned Movement, which include Cyprus and which form the backbone of the United Nations, can make a valuable contribution to the efforts to defuse conflicts aid strengthen the role of the Organization. Our public and private deliberations at last month's Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade, stressed the need for a constructive dialogue between the developed and the developing countries and explored ways of resolving global political problems, as well as economic aid social problems. Hence we welcome the increasing concern and involvement of the United Nations in problems of economic development a d in a number of global social issues with important political and economic implications.
Our gains in the political field could be seriously undermined by existing economic inequalities and imbalances. Despite an improvement in world output and international trade during the past 12 months, the economic situation of the developing countries has continued to deteriorate. In many developing countries economic growth is stifled by the debt burden; the overall debt of the developing countries at the end of 1988 was estimated at 31,240 billion, and debt servicing at a massive $171 billion. The result is a net transfer of resources from the developing to the developed nations. According to last month's World Bank annual report, the transfer of resources from developing countries to all lenders in 1988 rose to about $50 billion, from $38 billion in the previous year.
While we welcome the fact that several debt-relief initiatives have been put forward recently, we would like to stress that the third-world debt problem is largely the result of low commodity prices and adverse movements in terms of trade, exacerbated by high interest rates. Thus the debt problem can never be definitively resolved unless these issues are addressed. We believe there is an urgent need for a political dialogue on economic problemsâ The special session of the General assembly on economic issues next spring could provide an effective forum for such a dialogue. We also welcome efforts to revive the Economic and Social Council as a means of promoting the role of the United Nations in tackling economic and social issues. However, we would also like to emphasize the need for direct talks between the developed and the developing nations on these issues.
We face today a set of problems that fall outside the strictly political and economic spheres but nevertheless significantly impinge upon them. These problems are, in varying degrees, common to all nations. Their elimination therefore requires concerted international action. The United Nations has a key role to play in generating and co-ordinating such action.
One such problem is that of illicit drug abuse. Cyprus applauds efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking and is doing its best to contribute to the suppression of the drug trade. However, we stress the need to tackle the drug problem, which has grown to such proportions as to threaten the entire social fabric of some countries, not only by trying to stop the supply but also by trying to eliminate the demand.
Not only economic rules but also common sense tell us that demand generates supply, and that under such circumstances attempting to suppress the supply merely drives up profits from production and distribution. We must find ways of reducing - even eliminating - these profits, bearing in mind at all times that drug addiction is an illness and not a crime. Meanwhile, we must continue efforts to expose and thus short-circuit the mechanisms of laundering drug profits through banks and other channels.
The scourge of terrorism is sometimes a derivative of the drug trade. We stress the need for the sharing of information and the results of research for the detection of explosives or other tools of the terrorists' trade, and support Security Council resolution 638 (1989) condemning hostage-taking and calling for the release of all hostages.
All our other achievements in the political, economic or social spheres will have been in vain unless we succeed in tackling the smouldering ecological crisis faced by our planet. There is only one Earth, and it is humankind's one and only home. There is a vital need to link economic with ecological management, to link considerations of profit and production with environmental considerations.
We welcome the proposal made by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Non-Aligned Conference in Belgrade for the establishment of a 'Planet Protection Fund' and we recommend that this proposal be taken up here in the Assembly for further consideration and action. As early as 1972, the United Nations noted emerging environmental problems at the Conference on the Human Environment. The Organization can contribute significantly towards the elaboration of an integrated environmental policy to tackle problems such as the disposal of toxic or hazardous wastes, the depletion of the ozone layer, or desertification. We commend the ongoing United Nations Environment Programme - World Meteorological Organization study of climate change and its environmental and economic repercussions and the special United Nations study on key environmental issues, including the link between environment and development.
We are witnessing today, just as we did at the time when the United Nations was created out of the ashes of the Second World War, a rebirth of hope. Hope in humankind's better nature, in the triumph of peace over war, co-operation over conflict, human rights over oppression, and reason over barbarism. The United Nations embodies these ideals and represents our best chance of working together as a world community, on the basis of common principles and interests, to achieve them.  In the year to come let us resolutely strive to end conflicts, let us reinforce our understanding of the common nature of many of our problems, and let us take action to extend respect for international law and consolidate a global ethical order. In concluding, I should like to leave members with the thought that the price of failing in these goals is one which none of us can afford to pay, while success cannot but benefit us all.
","We are encouraged by the proposal made by President George Bush at the General Assembly for cuts of at least 80 per cent in the super-Power chemical-weapons arsenals, with the aim of a total ban on such weapons within 10 years of the signing of a multilateral chemical-weapons treaty, and by the very positive response of the Soviet Union. We cautiously welcome certain trends towards the dismantling of apartheid following the recent elections in South Africa, and hope for the speedy release of all political prisoners, the lifting of restrictions on political activity, and the restoration of freedom of speech aid movement. Motivated by a sincere desire to put an end to the suffering of the people of Cyprus - Greek and Turkish - I expressed, soon after my election, my readiness to meet with Prime Minister Ozal of Turkey or with the President, General Evren, since certain aspects of the Cyprus problem, such as the presence of Turkish occupation troops and settlers, can be resolved only by Ankara, unfortunately Turkey has so far not accepted my proposal. Our public and private deliberations at last month's Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade, stressed the need for a constructive dialogue between the developed and the developing countries and explored ways of resolving global political problems, as well as economic aid social problems. In the year to come let us resolutely strive to end conflicts, let us reinforce our understanding of the common nature of many of our problems, and let us take action to extend respect for international law and consolidate a global ethical order."

I should like to extend to Ambassador  Garba, on behalf of my delegation, my sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. That this important session has been placed in the hands of a distinguished son of Africa is a matter of great pride to my delegation and to Africa as a whole. There can be no doubt that he will conduct our deliberations with authority and efficiency.
I Should also like to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, Foreign Minister of Argentina, for the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during a very eventful year. I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to our Secretary-General my delegation's congratulations for his outstanding contribution in the pursuit of world peace and stability. He has succeeded in solving a number of pending regional crises and in improving the work of the Secretariat under difficult financial constraints. He can rest assured of our continued support.
This year we have witnessed the consolidation of peace processes. Great progress has been made in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty on the elimination of inter mediate-range and shorter-range missiles signed by the United States and the Soviet Union and ratified in June 1988 is a historic agreement because it is the first in recent history to abolish a whole category of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of the superpowers. In the sphere of multilateral disarmament the Paris Conference on chemical weapons, held in January this year, gave support and impetus to the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. My delegation looks forward to the day when an effective and universal chemical-weapons convention banning the production, storage and use of such weapons can be implemented.
My delegation notes with satisfaction the progress achieved in the negotiation on conventional arms in Europe, proposals for military reductions and confidence-building measures have been admitted by both Western and Eastern Groups at the recent Vienna meeting. It is hoped that those talks will lead to an effective and concrete reduction in the armed forces and conventional weapons in that region.
Our concern for peace should be global, we must take advantage of the new rapport between Washington and Moscow to liquidate any area of tension and confrontation, wherever it happens to be.
It is high time that the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean started the process of the demilitarisation of that ocean by calling for the convening of the long-overdue Conference not later than 1990, with the active participation of all permanent meters of the Security Council as well as the major maritime Powers. AS the Assembly is aware. the Government and people of Mauritius have not accepted the fact that an important part and parcel of their territory has been excised by the former colonial Peer in contravention of United Nations General Assembly resolutions 1514 ,XV| and 2066 (XX,. The dismemberment of Mauritian territory constitutes an unacceptable affront to our sovereignty. Mauritius cannot and .ill not remain silent until Diego Garcia and the Chagos Archipelago, as well as the Tromelin Islands. are returned to us. Our claim is just and legitimate. We have the total support of the Organisation of African Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, we appeal to the international community and to all peace-loving countries to assist us in the restoration of our territories. Our islands should not serve as a nuclear base and should not constitute a threat to our own security and to that of all the littoral âd hinterland states of the region.
The current political situation in South Africa calls for careful reflection and handling. We all agree that apartheid is the root cause of conflict in that region, and we have repeatedly called for its total elimination. It is a matter of comfort to note that many of our elder statesmen in Africa are initiating contacts with the South African Government in the true spirit of dialogue with a view to Pressing that Government to make the necessary changes to the satisfaction of one and all. We fervently hope that the changes promised by the new South African Government are genuine and that it will soon embark on the total dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a free, united and democratic society based on universal suffrage.
We cannot accept that a leader of the calibre of Nelson Mandela should be eternally confined to house arrest simply because he dared to raise his voice against apartheid. We demand his immediate release and that of all political prisoners. The lifting of all political restrictions, the withdrawal of troops from black townships, the lifting of the state of emergency and the cessation of all political court proceedings can only help to create a climate of confidence for the pursuit of a real and meaningful dialogue between the South African Government and its people. The opening of dialogue with the African National Congress will be a test of the sincerity of the new South African Government.
The liberation of Namibia has been a cause near and dear to us. Mauritius has always stood firmly by Security Council resolution 435 (1978, and its reaffirmation this year in resolution 632 (1989), as well as the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG, needs all our political and diplomatic support to lead and organize a smooth transition through free elections without interference and intimidation. We wish Namibia and the valiant Namibian people a new dawn and a bright and prosperous future.
With the resolution of the Namibian problem there was hope for a quick end to the conflict in Angola. We note with much regret, however, that the recent Gbadolite accord has failed to be given concrete effect, leaving the people of Angola still in the grips of war.
It is our fervent wish that peace will prevail in Mozambique, which has endured untold sufferings for far too long, similarly, we greatly commend the initiative of President Mubarak, the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, to mediate in the tragic conflict between two neighbourly African countries, Mauritania and Senegal.
My delegation last year rejoiced at the cessation of hostilities between the brotherly States of Iran and Iraq and their acceptance of the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We pledge to support the Secretary-General in his ceaseless efforts to quicken the pace of negotiations and entreat both parties to co-operate in good faith in order to reach a common understanding and a lasting peace between the two countries.
We are deeply concerned over the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank end the Gaza Strip, which poses a serious threat to international peace and security. We fully support the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for the recovery of their lost territory.
The intifadah, which has been going on for nearly two years, has made it clear that the Middle East stalemate cannot continue for ever. Israel must negotiate with the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the PLO. Any attempt to create a local Palestinian leadership in the West Bank is doomed to failure.
The PLO's desire for peace has been expressed emphatically, at the Palestinian National Council meeting in Algiers and at the United Nations General Assembly session in Geneva last year. This has entailed a major shift in the attitude of many nations to the PLO.
Tb prevent the tragic scenario in the Middle East from deteriorating further into a global crisis, the convening of an international conference under the aegis of the United Nations, with all parties, including the PLO, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 335 (1973), is of the utmost necessity. NO one can be insensible to the tragedy which has engulfed Lebanon. Such tragedies will recur unless and until we see the withdrawal of all external forces. The Arab League, the tripartite Committee on Lebanon and the international community must continue their efforts towards bribing peace and security in this war-torn country.
My delegation also deplores the fact that despite the Korean people's aspirations for the peaceful reunification of their homeland, Korea remains divided. This situation remains a great threat to peace. We welcome the efforts of the Korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully without any foreign interference and by means of dialogue and consultations between the North and the South.
The signing of the Geneva Agreements and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan had raised high hopes that peace would soon come to that country. My delegation notes with regret that the hopes have not been realized because of the non-observance of the spirit of the Geneva Agreements. Afghanistan presents a harrowing picture of devastation, of a million dead and 5 million refugees. The flow of more, lethal weapons will not break the stalemate that has settled over the conflict. The civil war since the pullout by the Soviet troops, during the last six months, has amply demonstrated that there can be no military solution to the Afghan conflict. A political settlement is the only way out. We appeal to the
United States and the Soviet Union, to bring the diverse elements together with a view to bringing an end to the present bloodshed in Afghanistan and restoring peace under an Afghan Government of national reconciliation.
My delegation welcomes the recent initiatives of the Presidents of the five Central American countries in their quest for peace and stability in that region. We are glad to learn that a United Nations mission will be sent to observe the elections in Nicaragua early next year. Similarly, we commend the ceaseless efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in bringing about the resumption of intercommunal talks in Cyprus. We hope that a permanent and durable solution will be found, to the satisfaction of both communities there.
We also wish to see peace and stability prevail in South-East Asia. The people of Cambodia have gone through great sufferings in recent years. The International Conference in Paris did not bring about the much-desired agreement between the parties engaged in the conflict. We still believe that all foreign troops should leave Cambodia - and we welcome the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops - and that the Cambodians should be given the opportunity to determine their destiny freely and without any hindrance. There should, however, be a guarantee that there will not be a return to the 'killing fields', to the genocide that still haunts the people of Cambodia.
It is an undeniable fact that the economies of the industrialized countries have been steadily growing during the last few years. Unfortunately, the developing countries have not benefited from this growth. On the contrary - their economies have been declining. Most countries in Africa and Latin America and several in Asia have fallen into a deep and protracted crisis. Their economic conditions are worsening, their social services are deteriorating, and the political stability is endangered. This negative trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the years to come unless decisive steps are taken globally. The combined effect of the debt problem and the scarcity of new financial flows has further exacerbated the economic crisis in the developing countries.
African debt has risen sharply from $78 billion in 1980 to $230 billion in 1988. African countries are having to borrow more and more to service their debts, thus enduring more severe economic hardship, while we appreciate the gestures made by some industrialized countries, such as France, the United States. Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and others, in alleviating the debt burdens of several of the most indebted developing countries, we cannot but re-emphasize that as long as the third world is made to retain the role of mere supplier of raw materials at non-remunerative prices, its future will continue to be bleak and the scourges of
poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy will continue to exist as we step into the next century.
A redefinition of economic co-operation is therefore essential to the prevention of a further deterioration in the situation. Economic relationships must be based on equality, partnership and interdependence. It is imperative that products originating in the third world countries should receive fair and remunerative prices and should not be subjected to various constraints. International agreements aimed at stabilizing prices of primary commodities must be negotiated and implemented. The countries of the industrialized world, which has the skills, the technical know-how and the economic means, are better placed to restructure their industries so as not to affect the nascent industries of third world countries, which otherwise will have to face severe competition. Growth and prosperity can be realized only by these measures. Such a liberalizing philosophy will mirror international solidarity and true partnership, m order to address adequately the pressing issue of international debt, there is an urgent need to reactivate the North-South dialogue and convene, as proposed by the recent Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries, an appropriate forum under the auspices of the United Nations to review ail aspects of the problem of external debt within the context of an improved environment for development and international economic co-operation.
We are deeply concerned by the state of the world environment. The warming of the atmosphere and the depletion of the ozone layer constitute a threat to the ecosystem which nay in turn affect the very existence of mankind. Island countries which are already prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and hurricanes are now facing grave threats from the rising seas - which is a direct effect of environmental imbalances. Furthermore, the oceans are being polluted by the irrational dumping of industrial wastes. Unless immediate measures are taken to prevent the aggravation of the situation we shall run the risk of compromising an important source of food supplies and raw materials.
While we welcome recent initiatives on global environmental issues, such as the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer and the Hague Convention, and take note of the positive actions relating to dumping of toxic wastes, we urgently appeal for remedial measures to be taken in favour of the most affected regions and we call for international support and solidarity in checking the pollution of our environment. At the national level also, the protection and the preservation of the environment must become an important factor in the conception, implementation and execution of new projects and programmes.
Finally, I should like to refer to a problem which has assumed alarming international proportions. Drug trafficking and addiction, to which the problem of AIDS is intimately connected, is already the new scourge of mankind. My Government has taken drastic measures to combat drug trafficking, and we will support all steps taken at the international level in this respect.
We are almost on the threshold of a new millennium, and we have no doubt that the major intractable global problems facing mankind and our planet will be handled with wisdom, vision and foresight, bearing in mind the enlightened principles of the United Nations Charter. The challenges we face prompt us to arm ourselves with a spirit of solidarity enabling us to confront the future with confidence and serenity.
Man has survived many wars and conflicts, and I am confident that in the nuclear age he will be able to muster courage and fortitude and use the natural intelligence with which he has been endowed to keep premature death and destruction away from his doorstep. I conclude by reaffirming my faith in mankind's willingness and ability to survive and to create conditions for a better tomorrow.
","The Treaty on the elimination of inter mediate-range and shorter-range missiles signed by the United States and the Soviet Union and ratified in June 1988 is a historic agreement because it is the first in recent history to abolish a whole category of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of the superpowers. We fervently hope that the changes promised by the new South African Government are genuine and that it will soon embark on the total dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a free, united and democratic society based on universal suffrage.

On behalf of the delegation of the Union of Myanmar and on my own behalf, I take pleasure in extending warmest congratulations to the President on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. His election to this high office reflects the confidence of all the States Members of the United Nations in his demonstrated diplomatic skills and leadership qualities, as well as in his commitment to the ideals of the Organization. It is also a fitting tribute to the great country he represents, the Federal al Republic of Nigeria, which has always been in the forefront in the quest for peace and security in the fight against colonialism and racial discrimination and in the promotion of economic and social justice in the world. Let me assure him that in discharging his heavy responsibilities he can count on the full support and co-operation of my delegation.
I wish also to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Dente Caputo of Argentina, for his valuable contribution to the success of the Assembly at its forty-third session. The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of great expectations. In the past year we have witnessed a continuation and farther consolidation of the positive and encouraging trends in international relations that have rekindled hopes for a better world.
As a result of these new trends the United Nations has regained much of its relevance, and the role of the Security Council as an instrument of International peace and security has been revitalized. Nat only Governments, but millions of common people around the globe are beginning to feel that the trust they had continued to place in the Organization during its time of trials and tribulations has been vindicated. Nations large and small are demonstrating more willingness to co-operate and to work within the framework of the Organization. As a result, we are witnessing a far greater inclination on the part of nations to rely on the United Nations peace-keeping operations than to resort to unilateral action. Here, I wish to pay a special tribute to the men and women from different lands who, often at great personal peril, are keeping the peace in many troubled parts of the world under the United Nations banner. Many of those emissaries of peace have been the victims of terrorism. 
At this juncture, the effectiveness of the united Nations would surely be enhanced further if all States that qualify for membership in conformity with the provisions of the Charter were admitted to the Organization. We therefore welcome the desire expressed by the Republic of Korea to become a Member of the United Nations, while not losing sight of the need for the ultimate reunification of Korea.
The enhanced prestige and renewed credibility of the United Nations are attributable not only to the marked improvement in international relations but also in large measure to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization.
Even during its darkest days he never despaired or wavered. Instead, with a single-minded dedication and an unflinching faith in the essential soundness of the idea of the united Nations, and ably assisted by his senior advisers and a corps of dedicated international civil servants, he ably defended everything the United Nations stood for Ä On behalf of the Government of the Union of Myanmar, I should like to place on record out sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for a very difficult job very well done.
The perceptible improvement in the international climate, particularly in the pattern of the relationship between the two super-Powers, is having a favourable impact on the solution of a variety of long-standing problems bearing on the maintenance of international peace and security. Nowhere is that impact felt more profoundly than in the field of arms control and disarmament.
The conclusion of the Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and its effective implementation in good faith by both parties, which has resulted in the destruction of over half their stockpiles, have generated greater mutual confidence between them. That is bound to provide a stranger impetus to bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament, issue of vital importance for the survival of mankind. That impetus has already led to the resumption in June 1969 of the strategic arms reduction talks - START - with the stated goal of a 50 per cent reduction. A successful conclusion of these negotiations would bring about a qualitative change in the power relationship between the two major military alliances and set the disarmament process well on course. It would also usher in a new era of enhanced international peace and security and thus be a historic achievement of Immense significance for the future of mankind.
While the conclusion of the IMF Treaty and the prospective reductions in offensive strategic weapons are indeed laudable  it bears repeating that the elimination of all nuclear weapons must remain the ultimate goal of mankind. In this connection we welcome the convergent view of both super-Powers that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We welcome this as an expression of their political will to halt and reverse the nuclear-arms race. The first necessary step to that end Is the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.
In the field of chemical weapons, the Paris Conference held in January 1989 expressed with one voice the collective will of the international community to see a world totally free from these inhuman weapons. Following years of seemingly irreconcilable differences on the principal issues involved, particularly the question of verification, significant forward movement was made this year when the Soviet Ð¨1Ð¾Ð¿ and the United States reached agreement on key elements of a treaty banning those weapons.
The memorandum of understanding between them on chemical weapons, signed on 23 September and providing for verification and data exchange, represents further progress towards that goal. We have been further heartened by the important concrete proposals announced by the President of the united States in the Assembly on 25 September and by the positive response given to the proposals by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union on the following day. Timely action to eliminate the world's two largest chemical-weapon arsenals could serve as an effective bar to the spread of chemical weapons. It is therefore imperative that these bilateral efforts be redoubled in order that multilateral negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament can move forward expeditiously and a universal convention on the total prohibition of these weapons be concluded at an early date.
The past year has been particularly remarkable for the United Nations as the focus of action in the search for the peaceful settlement of regional disputes and conflicts. However, the degree of success attending these efforts has varied. We ate happy to note that, thanks to the decisive action of the Security Council  id the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, the settlement plan for Namibia embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has progressed to a stage where we can look forward to the emergence of that Territory as an independent sovereign State, lb ensure Namibia's transition to independence, we urge all countries concerned, particularly South Africa, to fulfil in good faith the obligations they have assumed under the relevant agreements and understandings. The attainment of statehood by Namibia will bring to an end the last vestiges of colonialism in Africa.
Nevertheless, the rebirth of that great continent cannot be considered complete so long as millions of black South Africans remain virtually enslaved in the land of their ancestors under the oppressive and evil regime of apartheid. Recent developments in South Africa seem to have opened a window of opportunity for the minority regime in that country to institute fundamental and meaningful reforms aimed at terminating that obnoxious system at an early date. We earnestly hope the regime will seize this opportunity to introduce such reforms urgently. At this critical juncture, the international community should exert greater pressure, including the enforcement of economic sanctions, on the South African authorities with a view to attaining the objective of racial equality and majority rule in that country on the basis of universal suffrage. At the same time, encouragement should be given to the rising tide of liberal white opinion in South Africa in favour of fundamental change, which was clearly evident in the recent elections.
One region where peace initiatives from within the region itself are bearing fruit is Central America. The continuing efforts of the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to achieve the goals of peace and democratization they had earlier set for themselves in the Esquipulas II agreements and mote recently in the Tela agreement have brought the termination of a decade of turmoil in the region within sight. We believe these regional initiatives deserve the positive support of extra-regional Powers.
In the Middle East, despite some positive developments, represented by the Palestine National Council's acceptance of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute continues to elude us. The question of Palestine, which is at the core of the Middle East conflict, remains unresolved. No tangible progress has been achieved, end the formidable obstacles to the peace process persist. We believe the time has arrived for the parties involved to make their utmost efforts to bring about an enduring peace in the region in conformity with the terms set forth in the sand Security Council resolutions. Those resolutions provide the only workable basis for a lasting peace in the region, and any attempt to call their validity into question is fraught with incalculable dangers. My delegation supports the proposal that an international peace conference on the Middle East be held under United Nations auspices, with the participation of all parties concerned on an equal footing. 
Here, we would like to reiterate our unwavering support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine, including their right to national independence and sovereignty. We would also like to take this opportunity to express the hops that the continuing constructive efforts of President Mubarak of Egypt would facilitate our search for peace in that region. In the mean time urgent steps should be taken to ensure that General Assembly resolution 43/233 of 26 April 1939 be strictly observed and that, in conformity with its terms, necessary measures be taken to provide protection to the Palestinian civilians in the occupied Arab territories.
In Lebanon 14 years of hostilities have brought untold suffering to its people destroyed its economy, rent its communities and State institutions in shambles. Given the nature of the conflict, a solution of the crisis will require concerned international efforts. My delegation therefore welcomes the laudable efforts of the Heads of State of Algeria# Morocco and Saudi Arabia to end the bloodshed, to re-establish peace in the country and to safeguard its unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.
Coming nearer home, we believe that every avenue must continue to be explored in order to put an end to the protracted strife and misery in neighbouring Kampuchea. We are greatly distressed that the quest for a peaceful solution, which began in earnest with the Jakarta Informal Meetings in July 1988 and February 1989, and which was intensified at the International Conference held in Paris in the summer of this year, has not achieved the desire result. The continuing aim of the international community must remain the working out, on the basis of the gains already made, of a compressive political solution that would ensure respect for Kampuchean sovereignty, Independence and territorial integrity and for the neutral end non-aligned status of Kampuchea, as well as for the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination free from outside interference.
In the quest for such a solution the interests of the Kampuchean people must be held paramount. Noone should aim for anything less, and no one should seek anything more. The total withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces last month is an important and necessary first step towards achieving a settlement of the Kampuchean problem in all its interlocking internal and external aspects. Given the deep mistrust and bitterness generated by 11 years of foreign military intervention, it is imperative that all stages and aspects of the implementation of any settlement plan for Kampuchea be carried out under the supervision and control of an appropriate international median ism.
We find it distressing the emergent spirit of co-operation in the political field has not yet spread to the sphere of international economic relations. As the secretary-general pointed out in his annual report on the work of the Organization for the current year,
,the progress we have achieved in the global political climate can prove precarious if the economic climate remains adverse for the majority of the world's population,, (A/44/1, p, 19)
The efforts of the developing countries to bring about a new International economic order that would be more equitable and more supportive of their development processes has to date been largely unsuccessful. The present international economic environment remains non-conducive to the aspirations of the developing countries. Instead, those countries, Including my own, are faced with problems of mounting debt, inadequate flow of external assistance and falling commodity prices that have resulted in a sharp decline in their terms of trade. 
For many developing countries the overriding concern continues to be the impediment to development posed by external indebtedness. Although important guidelines for dealing with the debt problem have been land down by the international community, a solution remains elusive. The gravity of the situation is Illustrated by the net outward transfer of resources from debtor developing countries to their creditors, which, according to the United Nations World Economic Survey, 1989, grew to a staggering $32,5 billion in 1988. The solution of the external debt problem of the developing countries must remain a major concern on the international agenda. A formula for dealing effectively with that problem needs to be worked out through continuous multilateral dialogue and the shared responsibility of all. Past experience has amply demonstrated that the ,market menu approach, and its variants ace incapable of addressing the core of the problem. The search for an innovative international debt strategy should therefore be intensified. In this connection we consider that ideas that have been advanced for the creation of an international debt facility management one such approach and that the mechanics of such a facility should be given serious thought.
The least developed countries have been and are being hardest hit by those unfavourable developments. The over-all socio-economic conditions of those countries have deteriorated in spite of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted in 1981 with a view to improving their condition. That Programme remains the main framework for concerted international action for the economic and social uplift the least developed countries, and its successful implementation is of vital importance for those countries. Here, the delegation of Myanmar would like to reiterate the importance of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held at Paris in 1990 and of the preparatory meetings leading to that Conference.
My delegation considers that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in the spring of 1990 would provide a significant opportunity to conduct purposeful multilateral dialogue on the issues besetting the global economy and on the means of redressing them on a long-term basis. We hope that it would revitalize the North-South dialogue and that it would take into account the special needs and circumstances of the developing countries, particularly of the least developed among them. Moreover, the elaboration of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade that is now in hand will give a far greater sense of purpose and direction to International co-operation for development than hitherto.
The developing countries are fully aware that the responsibility for the development of their national economies rests primarily with themselves. Many of them are undertaking the daunting task of extremely difficult but necessary adjustment programmes. They also recognize that effective national policies are important in attracting financial flows and new equity investments and in creating a climate for sustained development.	'
While en this subject, I wish to touch on my country's endeavour in this regard, in my country we are undertaking economic reform measures and have carried out restructuring in selected areas of the economy. Accordingly, we have adopted an open-door economic policy and have under taken internal and external trade-liberalization measures in line with the country's socio-political conditions. In order to inject new dynamism into the performance of the export trade, there is now an increased reliance and special importance placed on the market mechanism. One of the most significant forces of the general liberalization measures is the increasingly important role expected to be played by the private sector in such fields as production, services and trade. Moreover, a foreign investment law  as promulgated in 1988 with a view to attracting greater flow of foreign capital investment. The aim of that law is to alleviate the capital constraint faced by Myanmar.
important as national policies are, the development of the developing countries would be difficult to bring about without a supportive international economic environment. A more open and improved international trading system would be of great benefit to the developing countries.
A great number of developing countries, including the least developed among them, are falling behind because of their inability to move out of traditional economic pursuits, namely, the production and export of primary products, the market for which has in the main been either depressed or unpredictable.
It is of vital importance to these countries that they diversify their exports. However, their attempts at diversification have to be made in the face of a growing tendency towards protectionism.
Foremost among the social concerns of the international community is the increasing threat posed to mankind by narcotic drugs. In recent years it has become particularly clear that drug abuse rends the fabric of societies and ruins the lives of individuals, not the least among them being the youth of our nations. What is urgently required, therefore, is to attack the problem in its totality, f t am cultivation and transportation across international frontiers to consumption and drug money laundering. In this connection, we in the Union of are fully doing our share by all means open to us. We have long been relentlessly waging a determined war against the menace of narcotic drugs as a matter of national responsibility.
We have land down comprehensive schemes to combat the drug menace and are energetically implementing them. The comprehensive programme which we have land dawn covers the whole gamut of drug-control activities, such as law enforcement, crop substitution, livestock breeding, medical treatment, rehabilitation, education and mass-media information. We have recently launched an integrated rural development programme with particular emphasis on infrastructural building, crop substitution and overall alleviation of socio-economic conditions. We believe that the successful implementation of the programme will accelerate the eradication of opium cultivation. In close co-operation with the United Nations, resolute action is being taken in all these fields. In recognition of the efforts of the Myanmar authorities, the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control has authorized an additional sum of $O.5 million in assistance. 
In the Union of Myanmar an elaborate legal basis is already in place to fight illicit drugs. In 1974 and 1983 the Government strengthened its drug-control laws banning the cultivation of narcotic plants and increasing penalties for illicit drug trafficking. The law prohibits cultivation of any and all crops from which narcotic drugs can be processed. It also provides for the destruction of narcotic crops and confiscation of equipment used in the production of these drugs.
In parallel with the foregoing measures, large-scale military operations are being carried out against drug traffickers and their production camps. The Myanmar security forces to date have not only destroyed 200,000 acres of cultivated opium, but have on innumerable occasions interdicted heavily armed opium caravans transporting the produce to transit points in the border regions. The amount of heroin seized as a result of the Government's campaign totals 100,000 kilogrammes. The magnitude of the task accomplished can be judged from the fact that the opium poppy is cultivated in remote regions of the country which are accessible only on foot or by helicopter, and the opium trails pass throughÂ· densely wooded and tugged terrain.
These successful campaigns have been carried out with great sacrifice on the part of our security forces. In the course of these campaigns well over 100 members of the Myanmar security forces have lost their lives and close to 550 have been wounded.
The significant achievements of our drug-suppression campaigns have earned high praise in foreign Government quarters, including the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. Despite this, certain quarters have chosen to ignore the strenuous efforts made by Myanmar and seen fit to level unfounded allegations against us. Some have gone so far as to accuse the Myanmar security forces of collaborating with the drug traffickers. Such accusations have deeply pained us. I would remind those who level these malicious charges against us that the ill-gotten proceeds from drug trafficking constitute the very life blood of the various groups that are waging an armed insurgency against the Myanmar State.
Earlier in my statement I paid fitting tribute to the men and women from different lands who are serving as guardians of the peace under the (United Nations banner. Members of the Myanmar security forces engaged in a relentless war against drug traffickers may not be wearing blue helmets, but the cause for which hundreds of them have sacrificed life and limb is no less internationalist and no less worthy.
In addressing the Assembly on 26 September in his capacity as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community (EEC), the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic made an appeal that the Myanmar people be allowed freely to exercise their right of expression  d that democracy be restored in the country through the organization of free elections. Furthermore, speaking on the following day the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom stated that there was an urgent need for restoration of human rights and democracy in Myanmar through free elections. I should like to assure them - indeed, the entire world - that that is precisely the objective for the attainment of which the Myanmar Government is exerting sincere arid unremitting efforts.
It is known to all that the people of Myanmar have manifested their genuine desire for and aspirations to a multiparty democracy and political reforms. The Myanmar Government has responded positively to those aspirations. It has instituted a number of far-reaching fundamental reforms and is actively carrying out a series of measures to fulfil the aspirations of the people. We have abolished the single-party political system and in its place have adopted a multiparty democratic sys ten. Purposeful measures have been put in train to bring about a smooth transition to the new system.
An independent multiparty democracy general elections commission composed of five retired, widely respected elder citizens was constituted in September 1988, The commission has been performing its assigned tasks since then. Two of the members ace Buddhists, two profess the Muslim faith, and one is a Christian belonging to the Kayin national race.
A political parties registration law was promulgated on 27 September of last year. Ito date more than 200 political parties have been registered with the elections commission.
On 16 February 1989 the commission announced a fixed timetable setting out in detail the various preparatory measures to be undertaken by it prior to the holding of multiparty democratic elections not later than May 1990. The respective time frames for the completion of these various measures were also specified in the timetable.
After soliciting and taking account of the views of political parties and the general public, an electoral law was promulgated on 31 May this year. Subsequently, on 30 June, election rules were promulgated. Nationwide electoral rolls are being prepared expeditiously, and other related measures necessary for holding free and fair elections are being carried out.
To put it in a nutshell, the implementation of the programme and timetable for holding elections is proceeding well and on schedule. The momentum will be carried forward and intensified in the remaining months before the elections.
Peaceful political activity within the law is being permitted, and political parties are vigorously carrying out their organizational work throughout the length and breadth of the country. In order to safeguard and consolidate the much-improved stability in the country, certain necessary restrictions have perforce to be imposed for the time being on public political campaigning. Those restrictions will be gradually relaxed as election day approaches. At the same time, the Government is laying a sound foundation for democracy. An independent judiciary, with the Supreme Court at its apex, has been re-established. The functions of the Attorney-General have been institutionalized. These institutions, indispensable to a democratic State, have been functioning normally since September last year.
Moreover, the civil service has been depoliticized and is being reformed into a body of men and women of high professional competence and integrity, dedicated solely to the service of the country. A mass-media campaign has been launched to instil in the general public the true values of democracy, such as respect for the law, respect for the rights of fellow citizens, and appreciation of the obligations that those rights entail.
I have highlighted some of the measures that are being conscientiously carried out by the Myanmar Government with a view to creating conditions conducive to the successful holding of free and fair elections. Assurances have been repeatedly given at the highest level that these elections will be held without fail, and as scheduled, not later than May 1990. I am authorized to reaffirm this commitment before the Assembly and, through it, to the world.
Here I need hardly mention that this national undertaking can be realized only in conditions where the rule of law and civil order prevail. It is a task to be pursued in a peaceful, systematic and orderly manner, in observance of the true values of democracy. This can be accomplished only by the people of Myanmar themselves. At this critical juncture no outside Power should attempt to prescribe for Myanmar what is best for it or what form its political future should assume. Attempts to channel future events in Myanmar in directions of one's own liking and according to one's own perceptions - instances of which we have, regrettably witnessed in Myanmar recently - not only violate the fundamental principles of the Charter but would prove ultimately self-defeating.
In this regard, I can do no better than quote the wise words of the Secretary-General, who in his latest report on the work of the Organisation saysÂ·.
,At this critical stage, the mandatory principle of non-intervention by States in one another's internal affairs acquires added importance. ... No State can, of course, insulate itself completely from the currents of information and opinion flowing in the world, but ultimately each national society must find its own equilibrium in accordance with its own values. Considering the web of memories, perceptions, aspirations and cultural values that constitute national life, any forceful pressures from outside to give it a particular form can hold little constructive promise in the long run. More often than not, they provoke a reaction different from the one desired., (A/44/1, pp. 18 and 19)
","The perceptible improvement in the international climate, particularly in the pattern of the relationship between the two super-Powers, is having a favourable impact on the solution of a variety of long-standing problems bearing on the maintenance of international peace and security. My delegation considers that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in the spring of 1990 would provide a significant opportunity to conduct purposeful multilateral dialogue on the issues besetting the global economy and on the means of redressing them on a long-term basis. A great number of developing countries, including the least developed among them, are falling behind because of their inability to move out of traditional economic pursuits, namely, the production and export of primary products, the market for which has in the main been either depressed or unpredictable. The comprehensive programme which we have land dawn covers the whole gamut of drug-control activities, such as law enforcement, crop substitution, livestock breeding, medical treatment, rehabilitation, education and mass-media information. Considering the web of memories, perceptions, aspirations and cultural values that constitute national life, any forceful pressures from outside to give it a particular form can hold little constructive promise in the long run."
44,1989,ARE,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. This election reflects the deep appreciation of the international community for the constructive role played by your country, Nigeria, in Africa as well as in respect of other international issues. It is also a token of esteem for your diplomatic experience.
I am pleased to extend sincere thanks to your predecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, for his performance as President of the last session.
I also seize this opportunity to reiterate the Government's confidence in the Secretary-General, and our appreciation for his efforts in resolving international problems and conflicts.
September the first marked the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War - a war that devastated the structures and resources of many countries and took a toll of millions of dead or wounded.
This was the incentive that moved the founding fathers who framed the United Nations Charter to create the mechanisms of the Organization and a code of international behaviour that would, if adhered to and respected, prevent the outbreak of armed conflicts and wars. Indeed, the United Nations Charter prohibits the resort to war and the use of force, except in the case of self-defence. The founding fathers envisioned the creation of a new international order based on peace and security, and the achievement of the goal of universal equality and justice.
The era of the United Nations has been characterized by an absence of world wars hence humanity has been saved from the scourge of global destruction. However, this has not prevented the eruption of numerous wars and conflicts in the third world. Let us bear in mind that so-called regional conflicts are but extensions of international conflicts. Therefore, the resolution of those original conflicts can be achieved only within the context of a positive international climate. That is why the present detente between the two super-Powers has been welcomed by all peoples of the world: it has had a positive effect on regional disputes and conflicts. We sincerely hope that no regional conflict will be excluded from that process under the pressure of certain circumstances.
In this context, we cannot but welcome the recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is our firm belief that the agreements will reinforce the process of detente and enhance our faith that mankind may be spared the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
International principles and fundamental concepts, especially the right to self-determination, should not suffer as a result of those developments and the new positive international climate that augurs well for mutual understanding between the peoples of the world. The enthusiasm surrounding detente should not make us overlook the fundamental rights of peoples that are still struggling for national political and economic independence. There are also peoples combating racial discrimination, as in South Africa, and peoples that are victims of foreign military occupation, as in Palestine. International peace and understanding cannot be sustained if they promote the interests of certain parties at the expense of others; otherwise, we shall be planting the seeds of tension for future generations.
If history is any guide, we may look to the future with the hope that the present policy of detente will lead to durable entente. The attainment of such a goal will transform current attitudes and values, with progress, stability and prosperity becoming the arenas of competition, and economic and social development becoming a universal right and an established fact everywhere. We also hope that this understanding will make us confront the new dangerous problems, such as the those of pollution and narcotic drug abuse, which threaten all nations, big and small, and all individuals, rich and poor.
We meet here every year to discuss our problems and concerns. Our priorities may differ, depending on our geographic locations, economic interests and political or religious persuasions. Despite those differences, we all aspire to build a world free from threats, persecution and injustice, a world in which we appreciate
each other's hopes and feel each other's pain. Against this background, we should like to share with representatives the concerns of the region to which we belong.
Our region confronts old problems, such as that of Palestine and those that have ensued from it, making the Middle East a region of permanent tension. Our region also faces new problems, such as the Iran-Iraq war and its effects. More than a year has elapsed since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq began. The United Arab Emirates was in the forefront of the countries that welcomed that important development. We considered the ceasefire to be the first step towards the settlement of all outstanding problems between the two countries and towards finding a just and peaceful settlement enshrining the legitimate rights of the two countries.
The stalemate in the negotiations - in other words, the current no peace, no war situation - does not serve the interests of either country. We all have a strong interest in the restoration of peace to the area. Therefore, we hope that a new round of direct negotiations will begin soon. While we appreciate the role and efforts of the Secretary-General, it is incumbent upon us to urge the two parties to overcome existing obstacles in order to move the peace process towards the desired goal.
The problem of Palestine is perhaps unique in modern political history. Several wars and numerous political attempts and initiatives have failed to achieve a conclusive settlement and to restore peace to that part of the world.
In reviewing the evolution of the problem, we find it shocking to note the enormous amount of resources and energies wasted in the efforts that have been made to resolve it, yet the issue, in essence, is clear. The problem lies in an attempt to deprive a people of its land and to stamp out its national identity. Every day Israel comes up with new excuses and pretexts, whose purpose is to prevent the
Palestinian people from exercising self-determination and to deprive the region of peace and stability.
The Palestinian people, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, responded constructively and with a high degree of responsibility to the new international climate, as is evidenced by the peace initiative offered by the Palestine National Council at its meeting in Algiers in November 1988. By continuously entertaining the dream of Greater Israel and implementing the racist Zionist theory, Israel is persistently perpetuating its psychological complex and its ideology by lopsided logic. This is manifested in the election plan suggested for the West Bank and Gaza by the Prime Minister of Israel, which included the following conditions: that elections should not lead to negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the occupied territories or the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Palestinians.
The Israeli Prime Minister also insisted that the elections be held under the guns of the Israeli occupation forces. One might therefore ask: elections for whom, and what is the purpose behind them? The only logical answer is that the Israeli Government's proposal is nothing but a propaganda ploy, on the one hand, to improve Israel's image in democratic Western societies, and, on the other, to relieve Israel of the pressures of the intifadah as well as international pressures.
Throughout its long years of struggle the Palestinian people has made great sacrifices; it has made greater sacrifices in order to promote peace efforts. It would be a big mistake to assume, on the basis of recent developments, that the Palestinian people will ever surrender its land or its national identity on the altar of an unjust political settlement.
Events clearly show that the Palestinian people is determined to continue its resistance and defend its land through its valiant intifadah, which will have completed its second year by the end of the current session. The Palestinians will continue their struggle, despite the brutal oppression of the Israeli military machine and its inhuman practices, and despite the fact that innocent children and young men and women are martyred every day on their national soil.
We believe that no settlement plan will prove viable unless it takes into consideration the right of the Palestinian people to exercise national self-determination and to establish its own independent State in Palestine. We also believe that the nature of the problem and the circumstances surrounding it make its settlement impossible outside the international context in which the problem initially originated; hence the need for an international peace conference in which all the parties should participate, including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the five permanent members of the Security Council. All attempts that do not follow that approach and have that goal are doomed to failure.
Another problem that still persists in our region is the crisis situation in Lebanon. We welcome the results reached by the Tripartite High Arab Committee and the acceptance by the Lebanese parties of the Committee's plan of action. We still believe that a final settlement of the Lebanese civil war can ultimately be achieved through understanding and dialogue between the Lebanese themselves on the basis of brotherhood, tolerance and a sincere desire to resolve all outstanding problems, without involving foreign elements in this domestic affair. 
We appeal to all foreign Powers that have influence in Lebanon to refrain from adding difficulties to the Lebanese problem and to stop their intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. We appeal also to the international community to help Lebanon at this critical stage to regain its full independence and restore its full sovereignty over its territory through the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), calling on Israel to withdraw its forces from south Lebanon and stop its intervention in internal Lebanese affairs.
While we look forward to the day when Namibia joins us a free and independent State and is able to exercise its role as a member of this international body after several decades of bitter struggle against the occupation by the racist regime of South Africa, we are increasingly worried about the future of the black majority in South Africa. The record indicates that the racist minority regime in South Africa is not yet ready to give up its policy of apartheid and oppression against the black majority. We hope that international pressure against the minority regime will not be relaxed. All efforts must be focused on the eradication of racism, as it has become irrefutably demonstrated that it cannot be reformed and that dealing with it can only reinforce its atrocious ideology.
The situations in Afghanistan, Cyprus and Kampuchea still require further endeavours aimed at reaching a final settlement in a manner that reflects the wishes of the peoples of those countries and the principles of the Charter. Despite relative improvement resulting from efforts undertaken to settle them, these problems still represent areas of tension.

We welcome the endeavours of the Presidents of Central America to bring to an end a decade of turbulence and strife in that region. The participation of the Secretary-General in these attempts will be a guarantee of their success. 
With respect to disarmament, important steps have been taken over the past two years, especially the agreements concluded between the two major military alliances. These agreements were the result of the detente between the two super-Powers. Of course, the road that lies ahead is still long. Quantitative reductions must be accompanied by qualitative reductions. Military tests and research must also come to a halt since they entail the waste of so many resources. We endorse the idea of transferring funds saved as a result of disarmament to development programmes, especially in the third world.
While significant progress has been made in the political sphere, developments in the field of international economic co-operation may give rise to pessimism. Following the stock market crash of 1987, world economic conditions have improved with increased trade and total output, contrary to expectations. However, world economic expansion has been asymmetrical. While the developed and the industrialized countries registered higher economic growth rates, the economies of Latin America and Africa have deteriorated, with declining growth rates. Consequently the per capita income gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to grow.
The single most formidable issue confronting the world community, as we embark on the next decade, is the resolution of the indebtedness of the least developed countries. The developing countries have been so encumbered by their debt obligations that interest payments alone to the creditors since the mid-1980s have far outstripped the total value of aid received by the developing nations. In 1988 those countries paid out $50 billion, in interest alone, more than they received in aid. This situation has further undermined the efforts of the developing countries to pursue economic growth rate policies. Debts and interests, in simple terms of figures, underscore the imperative for debt reduction, and in this connection we
welcome the Brady plan as a positive development. However, the solution to the debt problem will be contingent on the degree of co-operation and shared efforts of the debtors, creditors, commercial banks, national Governments and international institutions.
The instability in the international financial system should be cause for concern to the policy makers. Persistent trade deficits in the key industrialized countries and the inconsistency in their adjustment policies have put an enormous strain on the international financial system. The reverberations felt throughout the world financial markets in the aftermath of the crash in the United States of America is testimony to that fact.
The continued volatility in exchange rates and interest rates has eroded the confidence of investors and, consequently, led to a deterioration in the world economy.
We believe that the existing international system is not adequately equipped to cope with these strains and efforts at restructuring international economic relations on the basis of justice, equality and mutual interests must therefore continue. To this end the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, which is to take place in the spring of 1990, provides an excellent opportunity for members to review the North-South dialogue and to seek agreement on principles that should guide their co-operation in the years to come. This would lay the foundation for the adoption, later in 1990, of an international development strategy that would be the basis for realistic and genuine agreement on the commitments of all nations to tackle the huge problems of poverty, development and the environment that beset our planet.
The general debate will conclude in a few days. Many statements were made and more will follow. Most of them expressed confidence in the future and reflected
the hopes of some and the suffering of others. What is most important is that we preserve the achievements of international co-operation. Indeed, our overriding objective should be the preservation of this international Organization, which brings us together. It is also important that by the time we meet next we should find that suffering has been transformed into hope and hopes into realities. First and foremost, this requires confidence, confidence in our abilities as human beings and confidence in each other as States.
Big projects always start with small steps. Let us march together on the road towards a world in which love, co-operation, security and prosperity reign supreme.
","This was the incentive that moved the founding fathers who framed the United Nations Charter to create the mechanisms of the Organization and a code of international behaviour that would, if adhered to and respected, prevent the outbreak of armed conflicts and wars. We also believe that the nature of the problem and the circumstances surrounding it make its settlement impossible outside the international context in which the problem initially originated; hence the need for an international peace conference in which all the parties should participate, including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the five permanent members of the Security Council.

44,1989,GTM,"ï»¿
I come here bearing a message of friendship and solidarity from the people and the Government of Guatemala, who are taking part in the work of this session of the General Assembly imbued with the spirit which exists in this and all nations at present as they work to see, peace, to halt armed conflicts, to contribute to balanced development for our peoples, and to foster multilateral efforts to resolve the problems which affect us all. Mankind has now become a whole and the fate of each nation is inevitably tied to that of its neighbours. Every day, every year, our interdependence increases. The tendency on the part of some nations to hegemony over others is gradually giving way to the need to co-operate for the benefit of all mankind. The future of the United Nations is assured. 
Convinced of this, I am pleased to be able to say, Mr. Secretary-General your work has teen consonant with the spirit of times and has been carried out by you in a tireless fashion, working as you have been doing for detente, peace and general well-being. We are happy to note the success of the of your good offices, which represent a decisive contribution to reducing tensions in various parts of the world.
The current session of the General Assembly will bear the responsibility to continue efforts in this titanic struggle to construct a society of international solidarity. To do so with the efficiency we know and respect, representatives may call upon the solidarity and the support of the delegation of Guatemala, which, correctly interpreting the feelings of the people of Guatemala, will always be prepared to take part in dialogue and co-ordination among peoples.
I should like to recall that nearly half a century ago the end of a war was being celebrated and at that point, as peace became a necessary goal, the principles which inspired the Charter of our Organization formed the basis for a return to peaceful coexistence and civilized conduct. The people of Guatemala note with hope that the new international climate is helping to consolidate peace. We hope that peace will be a product of understanding and mutual respect and that it will not rest on force or the balance of terror. Understanding implies tolerance and it requires a recognition of the needs and difficulties we all face, together with the essential support which is necessary if those difficulties are to be overcome.
We must consolidate peace, where it has been achieved, through greater understanding and accords. The abandonment of rigid political models, the consolidation of democratic processes, detente among the greater Powers - which are now discussing disarmament and international security, recognizing that they cannot split up a world that does not belong to them - the negotiation of solutions to conflicts in various parts of the world and greater dialogue with respect to common problems affecting the well-being and security of nations and problems affecting our natural environment - those are all positive developments that are changing international relations. Confrontations must become aberrations - things of the past. The new leaders of the world will be those who seek to attain peace, not those who seek to prevail over others. We can say therefore that a renewed confidence in multilateralism is emerging. The United Nations, through its organs, through its Secretary-General, is playing an active role in the efforts to put an end to confrontations in various Parts of the world and to foster discussions that might lead to resolving problems shared by all countries. The regional peace initiatives supported by international organizations have assumed an unaccustomed momentum.
The new calls for peace-keeping operations are further signs of confidence in the United Nations. We welcome the fact that over the last three years four peace-keeping operations have been established, and the possibility of three more is being reviewed, including one in Central America. We hope that many other opportunities for the peaceful settlement of disputes may emerge and that the United Nations will continue its efforts to encourage and strengthen mutual confidence-building measures and other measures that increase understanding, thus preventing armed conflicts and reducing the risk of war. 
We agree with the Secretary-General that we must make maximum use of the United Nations capacity to set up peace-keeping operations pursuant to the Charter. We agree with the basic principles governing peace-keeping operations: a credible mandate, the full support of the Security Council, co-operation by the parties to the conflict, the willingness of Member States, including Guatemala, to contribute troops and resources, a geographically balanced and representative force, and an effective and integrated United Nations command with adequate logistical and financial support.
In the disarmament field the implementation of the agreements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the reduction of intermediate and short-range nuclear missiles has been satisfactory. We trust that this process will continue and that further practical steps can be taken in the talks on the reduction of offensive strategic weapons and those on the reduction of conventional weapons.
An integral part of nuclear disarmament will be the forthcoming Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Nuclear disarmament is not a Utopian objective. All the peoples of the world consider it as necessary for their survival and for the survival of all mankind. Guatemala will continue to support the revision of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, with a view to achieving a complete halt to such testing.
We energetically reaffirm the unanimous call made by 149 States during the conference on chemical weapons held in Paris, in January of this year, for progress in the drafting of a convention on the prohibition of the development, production, storage, acquisition, transfer and use of chemical weapons together with the destruction of such devices. We note with interest the proposal made by President Bush in this respect. We feel that it is necessary to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. Disarmament is a fundamental component in the process of consolidating peace.
Notwithstanding those positive trends, however, some problems represent a grave threat not only to peace but to the stability of our institutions and societies. I refer to drug trafficking, terrorism and the perverse combination of those two factors that has occurred in our continent, lb put an end to those destructive activities it will be necessary not only to have a firm political determination to combat them but also to co-ordinate joint measures in the field of security, it will also be necessary to make rapid progress in the development and codification of appropriate legal instruments. In Guatemala we have been deeply struck by the plight in which Colombia finds itself and we have expressed our solidarity with the people and the Government of that nation. We admire the decision and the determination of President Barco. We are aware that the symptoms which are causing a state of crisis in his country may be found in many of our own. That is why there mast be concerted action to deal with the problem in its various ramifications, including production, trafficking and consumption.
We are prepared to participate in a crusade aimed at protecting our societies.
From the outset, the democratic Government of Guatemala, over which I preside, has sought to foster coexistence among peoples, with respect for their sovereignty, the search for peace and the consolidation of democracy. We wish to share with other nations around the world the joy arising from the developments taking place in our nation in a climate of greater peace, participation and political stability.
Our contribution to this international climate, characterized by greater multilateral measures, has resulted in the following principles: support for action by our multilateral organizations in Latin America and around the world and acceptance of their active presence in the settlement of political, economic and human problems; the fostering of regional organizations which pursue greater integration around common objectives - I have in mind the Central American Parliament; active participation in the promotion of dialogue, the negotiated settlement of conflicts, and co-ordination for the establishment of consensus, as in the case of the peace plan known as Esguipulas II .
Furthermore, we support initiatives towards greater North-South dialogue. The social and political problems of balanced economic development should not be regarded as separate* they are the responsibility of the international community. I sincerely believe that this work and that of promoting co-ordinated action to protect the climate of our nation and of Central America represent a historic contribution to the future of mankind.
In that connection, domestically we have assumed the responsibility of fostering the development of our economy, making proper effective use of our own resources, channelling development inwards in order gradually to pay off a debt to society accumulated over the years and create more equitable living conditions for all the inhabitants of our nation.

We wish to reach the year 2000 on track for develops. But we know that the success of out measures of our measures requires adequate external  conditions that have not exists over the past decade. Indebtedness and debt-servicing, and the reduction of financial resources for development are problem that continue to affect us. We can understand the problems that are affecting the developed countries, but their protectionist measures, the general proliferation of discriminator, practices notwithstanding trade principles and practices that have previously been encouraged trade restrictions applied to exports fro. developing countries, monetary and financial instability, and high interest rates - to mention only a few problems - are all causing us a great deal of difficulty as we work to carry out the task we have set for ourselves. 
The United Nations bears a fundamental responsibility for fostering social progress and the attainment of better living standards for all the peoples of the world. In order to fulfil that responsibility effectively, the spirit of co-operation that has arisen in the politics! sphere must now extend to the economic and social spheres. It must be pointed out that progress made in the political climate can be consolidated only if we correct the economic climate that has been detrimental to most of the world's population. We believe that multilateralism, which has been an effective instruct in the promotion of peace, must be used to rebuild international economic relations. The United Nations offers a suitable framework for resuming broad-based North-South dialogue on international economic cooperation. The special session of the General Assembly scheduled for next year represents an opportunity for such dialogue. For our part, we are prepared to take an active part in that process.
Guatemala is ready to promote develop without Jeopardies, our ecology and the well-being of the future generations of our country and of all mankind. That is why we must express our deepest concern at the deterioration of the environment. Today, we cannot disregard the cataclysmic risks of climate change and other consequences of damage to the environment. All countries, from the most industrialized nations to the least developed countries, recognize the gravity of the problem and the urgent need to find practical solutions. The responsibility must of course be shared by all as regards measures to be taken. We feel it is important to emphasize, however, the primary responsibility borne by the industrialized countries as regards controlling and repairing damage caused to the environment, and their obligation to assist the developing countries in achieving environmentally sound and sustainable development.
The Central American Presidents, inspired by genuine concern, have established a Central American commission for the environment and development. I consider that the international community must step up its efforts and contribute to the protection of the tropical jungles in our region. It is necessary to avoid the consequences arising from their destruction and to secure additional financial resources to protect such areas.
In a further effort in the search for appropriate solutions to economic and social development, five countries of the Central American region held a conference in October of last year, at which we agreed to promote the establishment of the 'Mayan Trail', a large-scale enterprise which must be declared as a common heritage of mankind, it is consistent with the guidelines of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
The project is directly linked to the preservation of the environment, tropical forests, and their flora and fauna. Its aim is to encourage ecological tourism and to create sustained, non-destructive development that will not harm the environment and can generate employment and financial resources on a scale sufficient to preserve such areas, if the project is to become a reality, we need understanding and international co-operation. We need the determination to preserve the natural environment and to protect our indigenous communities of Mayan descent. The preservation of the environment is a legitimate concern of all, developed and developing alike, as is the elimination of poverty. Environmentally sound development must stress the elimination of poverty and the reduction of human suffering.
We do not desire economic development to the detriment of our neighbours. We desire political stability and a firm lasting peace that will benefit us all and permit co-existence, we wish to strengthen mutual trust among our nations and to fester a collective approach to our problems. We know that our policy of active neutrality makes us a factor of equilibrium necessary for peace, peace we wish to be permanent. But we are certain peace can endure only with the support of the international community,,
Our Central American societies have gone through the most difficult and bloody periods of our history, but we have a common destiny and we must return to the path of concord and peaceful coexistence.
Our house has been destroyed, and we wish to rebuild it on more stable foundations, strengthening the ties that bind us. In Central America we have been examining, discussing, and agreeing upon steps to achieve peace, development and well-being for our people.. We are rebuilding our house on democratic foundations through the exercise of our right to self determination and a future of peace and development. We wish to strive to teach our peoples to live democratically. We wish to ensure the right of all human beings to freedom of thought. But it is necessary to learn to live in peace, to set our weapons aside and to work together. Let us work together to turn Central America into a great nation. We must co-operate to find a solution to our economic and social problems, to provide our children with a decent, dignified life, we must eradicate poverty, adjust income and the distribution of wealth. We need education to improve our housing, clothing, health and food.
Since the Esquipulas meeting held in August 1987 Central American presidents have worked to bring peace to the region and have striven to fulfil the Esquipulas accords. In the course of this year we held two meetings which adopted new verification and monitoring decisions, as well as decisions with respect to the demobilization of certain irregular forces. We entrusted the Secretaries-General of the united Nations and the Organization of American States to implement the joint plan for the demobilization, repatriation or voluntary resettlement of members of the Nicaraguan resistance and their relatives. We have undertaken to facilitate the implementation of that plan, and we appreciate the international co-operation and humanitarian assistance to that end.  I would re-emphasize what was stated in this Assembly two years ago: that in our quest for peace and democracy in Central America the agreements reached by presidents in the region are not a reference point for discussion or rejection, but rather a starting point for finding solutions. Those agreements represent what we wish to see, and it is within the framework of those agreements, if they are
respected, that discussions to attain a firm and lasting peace in Central America will be achieved.
We hope that the Security Council will, in due course, authorize the setting up of a visiting observer mission as well as other requirements of the Secretary-General to support the demobilization of irregular forces. These steps, which represent a new stage in the development of the peace process in our region will contribute to consolidating the positive results of our efforts.
In El Salvador and Nicaragua, there are encouraging signs of progress towards national reconciliation, we welcome that progress and hope it will continue. Serious talks designed to achieve a cessation of hostilities have begun in El Salvador as a first step towards substantive political negotiations to  strengthen democracy. In Nicaragua a significant political event is being prepared that could represent the start of a fresh stage in the political life of that sister country, if the electoral conditions are consistent with the principles and commitments made in the presidential accords. We hope that the electoral observer mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States will not merely verify the existence of such conditions but will also help to suggest ways of improving them.
Aware of the historic responsibility to face up to one of the problems that afflict us most we held an international conference on Central American refugees. Its basic purpose was a humanitarian one: to find a lasting, stable solution to the problem, whereby it would become possible to voluntarily repatriate and resettle in their place of origin thousands of refugees and displaced persons now housed in our countries. Essentially, we lack the financial and economic resources for this but there is the will and the commitment to find a permanent solution. Each Central American has the right to live in his country of origin and must be taken in and assisted.
The General Assembly has adopted the Special Plan for Economic Co-operation for Central America, and we welcome the efforts that have been made to implement it. we also took part in the first meeting between Central American Governments and the co-operating Governments and institutions. We hope that the meeting will bear fruit and strengthen economic and technical cooperation with Central America.
The Guatemalan Government is seriously concerned that the situation in Panama could threaten the general situation in the region. With other democratic nations we stand behind the Panamanian people in its determination to overcome these difficulties by peaceful means and to satisfy its aspiration to live in democracy.  We reiterate the pressing need for us to channel our efforts into the restoration of institutional democracy, taking into account the spirit and aspirations of Latin Americans, while adopting an attitude of collective responsibility and accepting the initiatives to find peaceful solutions to the aspirations of the Panamanians.
With respect to Belize, we are prepared to work for a just, comprehensive and honourable peaceful settlement between the parties concerned. I would remind the assembly that my Government initiated direct talks in a realistic and constructive fashion with representatives of Belize who visited Guatemala to take part in important international events. Nevertheless, if our efforts are to bear fruit, here must be a realistic, flexible and positive attitude shared by both parties.
Guatemala has gone through one of the longest periods of peace, stability and social development in its history. The climate of freedom and participation became clear with the unprecedented growth, during the last 40 years of our history, of political, social and economic organizations which are fostering popular participation in the great decisions of the nation. Democracy in Guatemala is being constructed with the active participation of all sectors of society, but there are minority groups that are opposed to the consolidating of our endeavours. Since institutional development and our operating capacity still limit our possibility to guarantee the full measure of security due all our citizens and to have total control over those groups which are part of a past we would forget. People welcomes and appreciates the assistance and advice of the international community. Our practical progress with respect to human rights and the establishment of the rule of law in our nation has been accepted by all, but we so know that much still remains to be done.
The support and confidence of our friends and of the international community as represented in this Organization will help us to make progress in this respect, and to consolidate our democracy which was and will be available to construct the society of international solidarity which we wish to bring about. 
As one of the principal purposes of the United Nations, the task of fostering respect for human rights is a matter of legitimate international concern. Guatemala considers that United Nations efforts in this respect have been effective and we support the Secretary-General in his initiative to strengthen the Organization's role in providing advice and technical assistance to guarantee the protection of human rights.
Guatemala has benefited from that programme and appreciates the help received from the advisers assigned to our country. The United Nations has made an undeniable contribution to emphasizing the natural relationship between peace, justice, freedom, development and human rights. For this reason we joined in the energetic condemnation of any massive violation of such basic guarantees of the political development and freedom of peoples.  Guatemala vehemently condemns the shameful apartheid system, a flagrant violation of human rights. It is unconscionable that, despite two decades of United Nations struggle against racism and discrimination, this irrational practice should stubbornly persist.
RH
Our principles lead us to feel an active part of the international community. Guatemala has followed with concern the various diplomatic endeavours in the Middle East, we recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence on their own territory, which will not jeopardize the existence of the state of Israel within boundaries recognized by the United Nations. We supported the initiative to convene an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations.  

Guatemala hopes that both in Afghanistan and in Cambodia the efforts to achieve a comprehensive political solution will continue. These must guarantee the independence and self-determination of the peoples in question. Above and beyond the withdrawal of foreign troops, we feel that a political settlement must be encouraged, and that there must be no activities incompatible with the principles contained in the United Nations Charter.
The attainment of independence by Namibia has over the years been one of the major concerns of the United Nations. Guatemala supports Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the plan for the independence of Namibia within the whole of its recognized territory. We applaud what is being done by the Secretary-General and the staff of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). We are following with the greatest interest the preparations being made to hold free and fair elections under United Nations supervision and control. We energetically appeal to all parties, particularly South Africa, to co-operate fully With UNTAG, respecting their obligations at all times and fully complying with the agreements and understandings to which they have subscribed.
 I have referred in general terms to the matters which require urgent solution. I would end by reaffirming our faith and trust in the United Nations and in the capacity of the Secretary-General and of the present President of the General Assembly to continue to foster dialogue among nations, in order to fulfil our greatest aspirations: the establishment of a pluralistic society that can live in peace and harmony and ensure for the individual a decent, fitting life and the exercise of his fundamental rights and freedoms.
","ï»¿
I come here bearing a message of friendship and solidarity from the people and the Government of Guatemala, who are taking part in the work of this session of the General Assembly imbued with the spirit which exists in this and all nations at present as they work to see, peace, to halt armed conflicts, to contribute to balanced development for our peoples, and to foster multilateral efforts to resolve the problems which affect us all. The abandonment of rigid political models, the consolidation of democratic processes, detente among the greater Powers - which are now discussing disarmament and international security, recognizing that they cannot split up a world that does not belong to them - the negotiation of solutions to conflicts in various parts of the world and greater dialogue with respect to common problems affecting the well-being and security of nations and problems affecting our natural environment - those are all positive developments that are changing international relations. We can understand the problems that are affecting the developed countries, but their protectionist measures, the general proliferation of discriminator, practices notwithstanding trade principles and practices that have previously been encouraged trade restrictions applied to exports fro. Its aim is to encourage ecological tourism and to create sustained, non-destructive development that will not harm the environment and can generate employment and financial resources on a scale sufficient to preserve such areas, if the project is to become a reality, we need understanding and international co-operation. I would end by reaffirming our faith and trust in the United Nations and in the capacity of the Secretary-General and of the present President of the General Assembly to continue to foster dialogue among nations, in order to fulfil our greatest aspirations: the establishment of a pluralistic society that can live in peace and harmony and ensure for the individual a decent, fitting life and the exercise of his fundamental rights and freedoms."
44,1989,GRD,"ï»¿
I bring greetings from the Government and people of Grenada. My delegation joins in the many eloquent expressions of confidence and trust reposed in the President's great diplomatic and interpersonal skills as he presides  with unparalleled confidence and competence over the deliberations of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Additionally, ray delegation places on record our admiration and esteem for the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his outstanding conduct of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly.
The ray of light that burst forth on the international scene during the closing days of the forty-third session of the General Assembly gives hope that, as the curtain continues to rise on the Assembly's forty-fourth session, international peace and goodwill can be sustained, to the end that nations will increase their trust in one another and feel safer end more secure in their deliberations and interactions.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, an ardent advocate of peace, has, during his extensive travels to many geographical regions, advanced the peace process by his quiet, effective and skilful diplomacy. It is now left to the national leaders and those who walk the corridors of power to sail with the favourable wind that is blowing and the favourable tide that is flowing in the direction of international peace and security. To quote the Secretary-General in his recent address to the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade 'Never before in the history of the Non-Aligned Movement was there the fluidity in international affairs that we see today.' That fluidity in international affairs so eloquently described by Mr. Perez de Cuellar gives hope for the peaceful resolution of erstwhile conflicts in many areas of the world where, lately, signs of peace have emerged for the greater good.
The three-dimensional aspect of the conflict in the region of southern Africa - namely, the question of Namibia, the destabilization of the front-line
States, and the vicious, diabolical and institutionalised practice of racism, apartheid - is beginning to shows signs of that fluidity to which the Secretary-General referred.
Namibia is the best example. This last African colony, please God, will soon throw off the shackles of colonialism and take its place in the community of independent nations, where it rightfully belongs. The prospect of independence for Namibia came closer in December 1988 here at the United Nations when, in impressive ceremonies, a bilateral agreement was signed by Cuba and Angola to allow for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Similarly, a tripartite agreement was signed by Cuba, Angola and South Africa by which South Africa undertook to withdraw its forces from Namibia in like manner. This enabled the Secretary-General of the United Nations to establishment and dispatch the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission to the region, in accordance with Security Council resolution 626 (1988), of 20 December 1988, thereby implementing the Security Council's overall plan for Namibia enclosed in its resolution 435 (1978).
The initial difficulties and frustrations encountered since 1 April, when the United Nations team arrived in Namibia, should be worked out in a spirit of determination and goodwill on all sides to ensure Namibia's independence at the appointed time. We cannot afford to defer this to another time. To paraphrase the immortal William Shakespeare, there is a tide flowing in the direction of independence) if missed, it will cause misery in the lives of a gallant and determined people. Now is the accepted time. New is the time for Namibia's deliverance from oppressive forces. Now is the time to bring glad tidings to the poor, to proclaim liberty for captives and to give release to prisoners. If Namibia succeeds, it will create a psychological climate that will hasten the pulling-down of the odious, wicked and outdated practice of apartheid and its attendant pressures on the front-line States. The attention of the entire international community is focused on South Africa to see whether its new President is capable of ushering in the new society he has promised, or whether his so-called new approach is a mere tactical manoeuvre to consolidate his hold on power. The Government and people of Grenada, and history, will judge President De Klerk by his conduct rather than by his words. In any event, the writing is on the wall for all to see, even the architects and proponents of that barbarous practice.
An integral and significant dimension of the situation in South Africa is the continued detention of Nelson Mandela, the undisputed leader of the majority of the people of that country. It is immoral and a display of cowardice on the part of the South African Government to attempt to pursue negotiations with Mandela at this time with a view to resolving the problems which beset the country. The bargaining power is clearly unequal.
He therefore call on the South African Government to release him unconditionally now to facilitate meaningful dialogue between the parties in dispute. Mandela must be capable of forming an entirely free and unfettered judgement, totally independent of any measure of control.
The recently concluded Paris Conference on Cambodia, while not removing all the obstacles to peace, nevertheless gives hope that peace is possible in that region. That is borne out by the fact that the Cambodian parties accepted the Secretary-General's idea of organizing a preliminary fact-finding mission to gather on-site technical data to facilitate further substantive discussion in the pursuit of peace.
The problem in the Korean peninsula, a legacy of the Second World War and its aftermath, is a perfect example of how rivalry between great Powers, away from their borders but on the borders of far-away neighbours, can divide a once closely knit and industrious people, linked by consanguinity, affinity and cultural e elation ship.
The recent proposal made by President Roh Tae Hoc of the Republic of Korea to the National Assembly that North and South Korea adopt the national community charter in order to form a Korean commonwealth between the two Koreas offers much hope as an interim association in preparation for national unification. It is hoped that, with continued dialogue and constant contact between North and South Korea, the way will be cleared for the adoption of the charter by 15 August 1990 - the forty-fifth anniversary of the unnatural Korean division or dichotomy - thereby creating once again one nation, one people of remarkable talent and industry. If this proposal does not gain acceptance, there should be no impediment to admission to membership in the community of nations of the Republic of Korea and North Korea.
In Western Sahara, the peace plan submitted by the Secretary-General and the head of the Organization of African Unity, followed by the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a technical commission to implement the proposal, has been well received by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front. high-level meetings between the two parties have been taking place through the good offices of the Secretary-General, and it is hoped that with goodwill on all sides the settlement that has long eluded us will finally be cornered and achieved.
In much the same way, the communal talks in Cyprus, though at a crucial stage, offer hope for peaceful settlement with the help of the Secretary-General and his Representatives. In the interim, the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus deserves the full support of the international community as it strives to provide a buffer and maintain the peace between the Greek and Turkish communities.
The Geneva Agreement of 14 April 1988 which paved the way for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan was a promising step towards a peaceful settlement, and while intermittent attacks still continue the level of conflict is considerably diminished and there is reduced human suffering. This is therefore an opportune time for the international community to seize upon that initiative and to do everything necessary to ensure a permanent end to the fighting and the commencement of a level of dialogue that could pave the way to a negotiated political solution. In that connection, my delegation wishes to congratulate the Prime Minister of Pakistan for the contribution contained in her recent statement on the Afghan question. In the Middle East, the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war which took effect slightly more than a year ago is still holding, despite occasional charges and counter-charges on both sides. There is therefore more promise for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) for the restoration of stability and security in the region.
I wish, however, to remind the assembly of the unending plight of the members of the Bahai faith in Iran and the continuing deprivation of their sacred right of freedom of worship. I am informed that since the end of the forty-third session there has been a small measure of improvement in the attitude of the Iranian Government. But Bahais are still being denied the freedom to profess their religion; they are not permitted to meet as a community or to have a place of worship; their administrative institutions are banned; their properties are still being confiscated; and their holy places, sacred to the entire world-wide Bahai community, are still sequestered or are being destroyed.
This continuing religious and social persecution cries out for redress and threatens the fragile peace secured by the cease-fire. The United Nations must therefore address the problem seriously and urgently if we are to avoid a return to the recent instability in that country.
The Arab-Israeli conflict over the future of the Palestinians continues to be one of the major stumbling blocks in our efforts to find acceptable solutions to international disputes and to secure peace universally. But the Palestine National Council, meeting in Algiers, and the historical Geneva meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that followed it, brought new hope for a breakthrough, and it was with great expectation that we looked to 1989 for some positive movement towards a real and lasting settlement. It is therefore with some measure of disappointment that ray delegation notes that there has been no appreciable movement of the peace process and that at best the present position can only be described as being one of cautious optimism. But we nut continue our search for an acceptable solution we must not tire or falter. The stakes are too high and the consequences of failure too dangerous. We must therefore persevere to the very end.
The situation in Lebanon, too, continues to be a cause for great concern. The sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of that State Member of the United Nations continues to be trampled upon by an array of military forces - some foreign, some local, aid the senseless destruction of human lives and property continues unabated. The United Nations has a duty, through this body and the Security Council, to give serious and immediate consideration to the matter with a view to finding an urgent solution to the problem and restoring peace and stability to that troubled land.
In Central America, the five Presidents are tirelessly seeking to find a peaceful solution for a decade of conflict in the region. We commend them for their efforts to achieve their own negotiated settlement of the conflict, thereby fulfilling their aspirations to command respect and to exercise their independence, sovereignty and self-determination. In Panama, however, the situation has deteriorated and the people continue to be denied their God-given right to elect a Government of their choice. The strong-arm tactics of one man called the tune, to the prejudice of the vast majority of the population. The United Nations has a duty to speak out forcefully against that system and to do all that it can to help correct that situation. My delegation subscribes to the view that the implementation of the Esquipulas II Agreement offers the best hope for peace in the region. The agreement can be buttressed by the United Nations reconnaissance mission, now on the spot in the region, for the purpose of verification and monitoring of the electoral process, to be followed by repatriation and resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees of the displaced persons and families.
Central to the peace process in Central America is the humanitarian request which tine five Presidents made and the General Assembly approved as the special plan of economic co-operation for Central America.
Additionally, the recent International Conference on Central American Refugees, held in Guatemala City in May, signalled the good intentions in the region and in the international community for peace and national reconciliation.
The social, economic and political situation in Central America and in many developing countries is aggravated by the external debt problem, which has become a millstone around the necks of brave and valiant people who are experiencing economic strangulation as a way of life.
The situation in Haiti is of particular concern to ray country, as it should be to all our neighbours in the hemisphere. Haiti is the oldest black republic on the face of the earth and, except for the United States of America, it is the oldest sovereign State in this hemisphere, having attained the status in 1804. Grenada has a special affinity with Haiti because the revolutionary leader and king of
Haiti, Henri Christophe, was born in Grenada. The Government and people of Grenada are pleased to see the high-level delegation of Caribbean Foreign Ministers visit Haiti for the purpose of ascertaining first-hand information, which will aid Caribbean Community (CAR1C0M) Heads of State to offer help if so requested. My delegation hopes that there will be prompt issuance of an electoral calendar, as promised, that concrete steps will be taken to ensure free and fair lections, that there will be a smooth and easy transition to democracy, and that there will be successful co-operative management of the affairs of Haiti, which illuminated the hemisphere with revolutionary light and fervour.
On every occasion for the past four years, that my delegation has addressed the subject of external debt we have advanced the idea that a more practical course must be found to bring relief to debtor countries. While the repayment of debt is the legal and moral responsibility of the debtor, debt relief, in view of the prevailing third-world economic situation, should be given humane and moral consideration by the creditors.
My delegation commends those creditor nations which are beginning to exercise this consideration by either forgiving or reducing the debt obligation. Such a positive step will reduce the social and economic frustrations and hardships that threaten the very stability and security of many debtor countries. In the ease of my region, the narrow base of our economies and the specific character of our external debt, primarily to multilateral institutions, emphasize the need for programmed debt reduction. This is the only way to ensure that the necessary financial means are available for investing in our generation's future and for putting in place the necessary infrastructure upon which that future is to be built.
At the forty-third session of the General Assembly I had occasion to invoke the peculiar plight of small island developing countries. It would be remiss of me not to reiterate, at this forty-fourth session, the concerns then expressed.
especially in the light of the devastation that hurricane Hugo recently wrought on three sister Caribbean States, namely, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis, as well as Montserrat and other territories in the region.
Indeed, at the forty-third session, in its resolution 43/189, entitle 'Specific measures in favour of island developing countries', the General Assembly acknowledged the specificity of Member States in that category. There must, however, he effective implementation of paragraphs 10 and 11 of resolution 43/189. In fact, meaningful follow-through in the matter of 'specific measures' entails actively engaging the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as well as various agencies of the United Nations system, at the level of financial measures, funding or operational activities. The results of the inter-agency framework to be identified by the Secretary-General must be translated into concrete action.
This session of the General Assembly Is taking place on the threshold of the final decade of tills century. It would appear that a sense of urgency has entered the debate regarding the development of the developing world. Thus, during the high level segment of the thirty-sixth session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) the focus of attention was on the role of the United Nations Development programme in the 1990s. There has been a call for a special session of the General Assembly in April 1990 devoted to international economic co-operation and in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing countries. In yet another forum we are in the throes of formulating what is intended to be an international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, that is, the Decade of the 1990s.
My delegation sincerely hopes that the international community will face up to the challenge of addressing the issues which have been highlighted in the context
of the comprehensive policy review of operational activities of the United Nations system, under item 86 of our agenda.
We in the Caribbean have been engaging in our own stock-taking so that we may be better equipped to answer to the demands and expectations of our peoples in the decade ahead. But our endogenous efforts in the area, inter alia, of human resource development, housing and human settlement, health care, agriculture and industrial development cannot be essayed in a vacuum.
I now wish to reaffirm Grenada's continuing commitment to the United Nations, the organization of American States, the British Commonwealth, the Caribbean Community, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and all other national and international organizations which assist us in achieving our foreign policy objectives, the centrepiece of which is the promotion of peace and brotherhood among members of the global community. We are guided in the pursuit of this objective by the preposition that peace and democracy are inextricably linked, and so it comports with our policy to give moral support to the people who struggle for peace and democracy.
Our penchant for democracy is informed by the recent traumatic episode in our history when we took democracy for granted. On the basis of that experience, we have elected to govern and be governed by a system which, inter alia, demands and guarantees respect for the rights of the human person, provides numerous safeguards under an independent judiciary, allows freedom of expression, affords people an opportunity to participate in the political decision-making process, imposes restraints on dictators of every persuasion and tendency, and yet is capable of accommodating our very many differences and diversities.
This brings me to the consideration of two issues that are potentially capable of mortgaging the future of our youth*, protection of the environment and drug trafficking and drug abuse. Both of these questions were on the agenda of the recently concluded tenth meeting of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community - a meeting which my country had the honour of hosting last July.
Man's propensity to self-destruction has heretofore been the object of our concern within the ambit of international warfare. The modern-day scourges of man-propelled degradation of the environment and drug abuse and drug trafficking must be frontally attacked. We must build on the heightened consciousness of the transboundacy nature of the problems and hammer out solutions in keeping with such a focus. In this vein, Grenada fully subscribes to the precepts embodied in the Basle Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, adopted in March 1989.
It is to be noted that, at the meeting of Heads of Government alluded to earlier, we in the Caribbean endorsed proposals to combat drug trafficking submitted by Jamaica and by Trinidad and Tobago. The said proposals have now found expression in two draft resolutions to be considered at this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. They clearly envisage an active role foe the United Nations in this domain and could be viewed as furthering the objectives of the
United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic drugs and Psychotropic Substances, adopted in Vienna in December 1988.
Last year my delegation congratulated President Reagan and President Gorbachev on their contributions to the lessening of international tensions and urged them to continue their dialogue so that the wind of change blowing over certain regions would increase in intensity and increase to encompass the whole world, bringing greater understanding and tolerance among its peoples. I now wish to congratulate President Bush for his contribution to the new spirit of detente and rapprochement and to ask him to maintain, with President Gorbachev, a level of dialogue that would enable them to achieve the trust and confidence so vital to the relaxation of international tensions. We note with satisfaction and with joy the new political climate in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia and in certain parts of Central America and Africa. We note also the recent parliamentary elections in the Soviet Union and in Poland, and the emergence of a Solidarity-led Government in Poland. What a relief to see East Germans being able to cross over into West Germany without being exposed to the threat of death in the process.
There can be no doubt that over the last year, we have made appreciable progress in several fields and in several regions of the world, and that we have come a long way in abating the tensions and the dangers that have so often threatened us with destruction. We must not, however, lower our guard or relax our vigilance, lest we become complacent. Let us rather be ever mindful of the continuing threat posed to the world by three international problems, the drug menace, the debt burden, and the south Africa problem, any one of which could plunge the world into darkness and despair. We must intensify our efforts in the search for new ways of dealing with these problems so we may be able to neutralize and eventually remove the dangers to world peace inherent in their continued existence.
It is my belief, however, that notwithstanding the progress we might make elsewhere in the world, the world will continue to be threatened as long as the South Africa problem remains unresolved. Civilized man must never allow himself to be perceived as having accepted or acquiesced in the continuance of the beastly system of government in South Africa. The time has come when, because of its influence and prestige, the United Nations must speak out more forcefully against apartheid aid initiate the level of dialogue and the kind of action that could lead to an immediate dismantling of the system and the granting to the approximately 26 million black people of that country of the God-given right to choose their own form of government by the exercise of their franchise.
Five years ago, the people of Grenada traded their rifles for the ballot box in a bold attempt to fulfil their aspirations for freedom, an inalienable feature of democratic culture. Today Grenada is at peace with itself aid at peace with democracy. The black majority of South Africa has the right to that same peace and that same democracy, and we have a duty to help them achieve them now.
If we could find the courage to accept the urgent need to act together and with the necessary resolve in seeking solutions to these seemingly intractable problems, then our world might, some day during our lifetime, come to experience aid to enjoy the peace, stability and prosperity that have eluded us for so long.
May God continue to shower His blessings upon us and may He also continue to guide us as we plod out weary way in search of happiness and security.
","The ray of light that burst forth on the international scene during the closing days of the forty-third session of the General Assembly gives hope that, as the curtain continues to rise on the Assembly's forty-fourth session, international peace and goodwill can be sustained, to the end that nations will increase their trust in one another and feel safer end more secure in their deliberations and interactions.

Mr. President, permit me at the outset to convey to you the sincere congratulations of my country's delegation on your election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. It is an honour to our African continent that you have been chosen for this esteemed position. I am also pleased, because you belong to a friendly State which maintains strong historic and cultural relations with mine. I have every confidence that your qualities and rids experience will help us to achieve the desired results of this session.
It also gives me pleasure to express the appreciation and gratitude of the Libyan Arab delegation to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his competent and commendable handling of the work of the previous session.
I should also like to express our great appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Pere2 de Cuellar, for his sincere efforts to advance the ideals of the United Nations and for the initiatives he has taken to improve the performance of the Organization and peacefully resolve the complex problems facing the international community.
Despite problems and political pressures, the United Nations has proved that it really deserves our confidence, and that it can accomplish much of what we aspire to as an international group, if we have the will to create the appropriate climate for the Organization.
The United Nations is the embodiment of our common will to close our ranks in working for the realization of the deeply cherished aspirations of mankinds namely, peace, freedom, justice and prosperity A cursory look at the world today, which is beset with problems and issues that accumulate year after year, shows clearly that we are regrettably far from making any real progress towards the noble purposes for whose achievement the United Nations was established.
The reasons for the continuing erosion of the Organization's potential are well known. Thus the declaration issued by the Ninth Summit Conference of Heads of States or Government of the Movement of NonâAligned Countries has expressed our concern about the realities of the Organization and voiced our hopes for its future when it states that: 'Despite all challenges, the United Nations system has stood the test of time. Even those who are still ignoring the United Nations as a forum for collective action of States have increasingly realized that this Organization is an indispensable means to regulate international disputes and to endeavour to solve international problems â..'.
In another section, the declaration continues:
'To this end, we shall endeavour to strengthen the machinery of the United Nations and to revitalize, expand and co-ordinate its activities ...'. The Charter, which should guide our work, Is constantly being flouted: areas of tension are spreading; dangers are becoming more acute. This stems from the insistence of certain Powers to give the policies of force, intimidation and terrorism the upper hand over the spirit of co-operation, understanding and constructive dialogue.
There are many persistent violations of the Charter, the most serious of which glares at one at the entrance to this building, where the flags of the most repulsive regimes known in modern history are hoisted, namely, the apartheid regime in South Africa and the racist Zionist entity in occupied Palestine. These two regimes are closely related; they represent a challenge to moral principles and right. I believe that as an international group we should not tolerate a falsehood that we can change if we so desire.
Major developments have taken place in the international arena since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. The current international situation is different from that of 194 5. Thus we appeal for serious collective action to strengthen the role of the Organization. This we believe, will require the review of those provisions of the Charter which are inconsistent with existing international circumstances.
We urge the Special Committee on the Charter and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization to move from the consuming phase of consideration and discussion to the phase of proposing practical solutions and of submitting specific proposals on the provisions that cripple the Organization's effectiveness.
Worthy of note among these provisions is the veto privilege, which has become an insurmountable obstacle to international unanimity. That privilege has been abused by some of the States that enjoy it. They use it not to defend what is right and to preserve international peace and security, but to consecrate falsehood and promote aggression, occupation, invasion and terrorism. My country, which is honoured to have taken the initiative in calling for a review of the veto privilege, reaffirms its resolute stand on this issue.
We have great faith in the United Nations and in its ever-more essential role. We believe that the strong and united will of peace-loving nations can help the Organization achieve the desired effectiveness. It alone can deter those who espouse policies of threats and force.
My country has suffered from detestable imperialist practices, past and present. At the beginning of this century it was subjected to hateful fascist invasion, occupation and colonialism, during which it suffered from all forms of oppression, destruction and attempts at genocide.
During the Second World War, the Libyan territory became a major battlefield and our people paid an exorbitant material and human price. Although the war ended for its principal parties, its vestiges - the mines and other war materiel left behind by the warring forces with no consideration for the inhabitants of the country - continue to plague us. Libyans still suffer material and human losses as a result of them. Years ago, we took the initiative and raised the problem in the General Assembly, which adopted numerous resolutions calling upon the States responsible for deploying and leaving those deadly weapons to provide all necessary information, help in their removal and compensate for the human and material damage caused by them. Today, through this forum, we renew our appeal to the
international community to urge the States concerned to act in a responsible manner and implement the provisions of the Assembly's resolutions.
My country is just an examples the phenomenon is much wider in scope. The States which invaded and colonized our countries, exploited our economic and human resources and fought over our territories in the past should shoulder the historic responsibility of atoning for their acts. Thus we urge consideration of the question of compensation for invasion and colonial exploitation. The States concerned must take moral responsibility as the point of departure in considering this issue. Compensation for colonialism is the least we can expect of imperialist States. We must realize that the problems facing many States in the developing world today were caused by the suffering of their peoples during the periods of invasion and colonialism.
As the Ninth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries declared in its special paper on decolonization,
'The Heads of State or Government called upon all former and present imperialist Powers to shoulder their responsibilities and pay all due compensation for the economic, social and cultural consequences of colonizing developing countries.' Perhaps the most repulsive act to which my country has been exposed was the direct military aggression launched in the spring of 1986 against our peaceful cities by a super-Power which is also a permanent member of the Security Council; let alone the repeated provocative and hostile actions perpetrated against us by that State since the early 1980s. It has also imposed economic, scientific and cultural boycott measures against us, which is entirely unjustifiable.
The international community has rejected and condemned those practices. This was reflected in General Assembly resolution 41/38, which affirmed that the aggressive State pay compensation for material and human losses incurred as a result of treacherous acts of aggression. Today, we once again strongly call upon the international community to urge the aggressive State to shoulder its responsibilities and comply with this resolution and implement its provisions without delay.
My country, as one of the States bordering the Mediterranean basin, attaches great importance to the question of strengthening security and co-operation in that region. We have constantly called for making the Mediterranean basin 'a zone of peace', for we are fully aware that peace and security in the region is closely related to international peace and security. The Mediterranean has become one of the most dangerous areas of tension in the world because of Zionist practices in and around occupied Palestine and because of the insistence of certain imperialist Powers on transforming the Mediterranean into a base for foreign military fleets and an arena for manoeuvres, provocation, including acts of air and naval piracy, as well as a launching pad for acts of direct aggression against certain States.
My country is committed to working to support regional and international efforts to bring about effective security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region. As we applaud the persistent efforts made by the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the region, we renew our call for other littoral States of the Mediterranean to discharge their responsibilities and enter into a meaningful and balanced dialogue to establish strong and lasting bases for co-operation. We believe that achieving these objectives begins with a common conviction of the need to take collective measures, among which priority should be given to ending racist Zionist practices in occupied Palestine and demanding the immediate withdrawal of military fleets from, and the dismantling of foreign bases in, the region.
The issues of human rights command great attention in our country. This arises from an unfaltering belief that respect for human dignity is the basis for peoples* progress and prosperity. This respect derives from a culture and a religion whose central theme is respect for man and humanity. Allah stated in the Holy Koran:
'We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favours, above a great part of our creation.' (The Holy Koran, XVII.-70) Human dignity is realized by observing principles, first and foremost among which is equality as a common human value. Islam decrees that all people are equal 'as the teeth of a comb' - that no distinction should be made except that based on competence, work and what each person offers to his God, to himself, his country and humanity. Thus Islam abolished the caste and class systems - discrimination based on differences related to ancestral claims, kinship and colour. In this context Allah said:
'Oh mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other. Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). (The Holy Koran, XLIX:13)
The Prophet - peace be upon him - said in his farewell pilgrimage sermon in which he drafted a constitution for mankind:
'Oh ye people, verily your God is One, and your father is one. All mankind is the progeny of Adam who was fashioned out of clay. The noblest of you in the sight of Allah is the one who is most God-fearing. There is no superiority for an Arab over a non-Arab and for a non-Arab over an Arab, nor for the white over the black, nor for the black over the white except in piety.' The words of the just Caliph Omar Ibn A1 Khattab will echo throughout time, for having admonished one of the administrators under his caliphate: 'Since when have you reduced people, who were born free, into servitude.1'
In March 1988, Libya took major practical and legal steps to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels. The year 1989 witnessed developments that reinforced our accomplishments. Early this year, the Freedom Consolidation Act was adopted and accession to a large number of international conventions in the field of human rights was ratified. Moreover, the International People's Committee on the Qadaffi Prize for Human Rights was established. This summer my country hosted the first meeting of that committee, during which the Qadaffi Prize for Human Rights was awarded to the African freedom fighter Nelson Mandela.
We are determined to continue supporting efforts of the international community through the United Nations and its bodies concerned with human rights to attain the lofty aims cherished by humanity. In this respect, we stress that the racist practices in occupied Palestine and South Africa represent an outrageous defiance of the will of the international community and an intolerable contempt for human rights.
The Palestine question is at the top of the list of issues that concern the international community, even though certain quarters wish otherwise. This priority is given not only because the Palestine question involves real threats to international peace and security, but also because it is a defiance of ethical values and an attack on rights, in contempt for all values. This question is still the main concern of my country. We believe that night, however long it nay be, is followed by day; injustice, however prolonged it may be, must come tc an end. The people's struggle derives from the will of Allah and this must be victorious.
The intifadah of the Palestinian people against Zionist occupation, which has been going on for nearly two years, has reminded the world once again of this people's tragedy. The barbaric practices of Zionists against unarmed children and women - unarmed except, perhaps, with stones - reveal the true nature of Zionism and prove that the aim of Zionist terrorists and those who  ack them is the eradication of the Palestinian people as a first step to attaining objectives that target the very existence of a nation.
The uprising - the intifadah - has also proven that it is impossible to suppress a people's will to attain its lawful aspirations and that any separate, or even international, attempts to make peace deals that run counter to that people's will cannot achieve success.
Our stand on this question emanates from our compliance with international instruments, morality and the dictates of national duty. Our stand is a firm and clear one-. We fully support the struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate its territory, enjoy its right to self-determination and establish an independent state on the whole Palestinian territory, with Jerusalem as its capital.
It is incumbent on the international community to shoulder its historic responsibility of restoring rights to those lawfully entitled to them. The United Nations, which has conferred legality on the occupying Zionist entity at the expense of rights, justice and morality, thus committing an unparalleled historic blunder, is called upon to remedy this situation.
The tragic situation in Lebanon is another by-product of the illegal existence of the Zionist entity in our Arab region. My country, which has constantly called for preserving the unity and territorial sovereignty of Lebanon, believes that resolving the Lebanese problem involves primarily the immediate and complete withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces from every inch of Lebanese soil and putting an end to the interference of that entity and other foreign Powers in Lebanese affairs, thus enabling all brotherly Lebanese groups to hold a dialogue in the spirit of fraternity and tolerance.
We maintain that the efforts made within the framework of the Arab League - namely the Tripartite Commission - can help our Lebanese brothers overcome their plight. We call upon all peace-loving forces to support these efforts.
My country is following with great interest the developments which have taken place since the cease-fire in the Gulf War. It renews its sincere call for the two Muslim States, Iraq and Iran, to respond in a fraternal and Islamic manner to the efforts made by the international community to implement Security Council resolution 5S8 (1987).
The Namibian question, which has long been, at the forefront of the political problems facing the international community, has reached a crucial state, that of the cautious anticipation of the intensive international efforts being made to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).
The Namibian people who have made enormous sacrifices in their struggle are in need of support from the international community today when there are many manoeuvres aimed at creating a situation in Namibia that would enable the apartheid regime to direct at will the results of the elections. My country, which has always provided various forms of political and material support to the Namibian people throughout the period of their heroic and honourable struggle, reiterates its commitment to support the struggle till the Namibian people achieve all their lawful aspirations.
While dealing with the current situation in Namibia, we should convey our profound appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his. assistants, especially those working in the field, for their efforts to help the Namibian people achieve true independence.
At the previous session, we expressed the hope that the anticipated independence of Namibia would represent a real step towards the elimination of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Today, as we are about to achieve the cherished aim of Namibian independence, we entertain new hopes that this victory will give new and powerful impetus to the struggle of the liberation movement in all its forms, to eradicate the apartheid regime. Because of its firm belief in the cause of freedom and its support for the oppressed, Libya reaffirms its complete willingness to continue its effective contribution with a view to bringing about a comprehensive escalation of the struggle against racists and to attaining victory for the oppressed African people in South Africa.
We should not fail to pay a tribute to the peoples of the African front-line States for their enormous sacrifices.
In our region, the question of Cyprus has not been resolved. My country wishes to reiterate that a just, lasting and peaceful settlement of this question should be based on the unity, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus, ridding it of foreign bases as well as guaranteeing the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities.
As for Afghanistan, my country reiterates its support for all international efforts aiming at preserving the unity of the Afghan people, their sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. It sincerely urges all our brothers in Afghanistan to resolve their differences in a manner guided by wisdom, fraternity and understanding.
My country supports the lawful aspirations of the Korean people to reunify the two parts of their country by peaceful means, without any foreign interference. My country also calls for the dismantling of foreign bases and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.
Nuclear and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction represent the main danger that threatens mankind with annihilation. What adds to the complexity of th is issue is the insistence of certain nuclear Powers on engaging in a race to develop and modernize their arsenals at a time when humanity is aware of a certain degree of detente. As regards cessation of the nuclear-arms race, humanity has great expectations.
As a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Convention on the Prohibition of Bacteriological Weapons and the Geneva Protocol, my country supports all regional and international endeavours to curb the nuclear-arms race and eradicate nuclear weapons. It also supports all international measures and efforts to prohibit all types of weapons of mass destruction.
We lend support to the principle or: establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in any part of the world, including Africa and the Middle East. We believe, however, that this goal will remain out of reach because favourable circumstances have not been created, as there are racist regimes in both South Africa and Palestine. These regimes have co-operated closely and constantly in the field of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
Recently, the Zionist entity was experimenting with long-range missiles in the the Mediterranean when one of the missiles landed near the Libyan city of Benghazi. There is no doubt that the acquisition of these weapons of mass destruction by the Zionist entity threatens the entire region. The history of the Zionist entity, its practices and, above all, the fact that it has attacked Tunisia twice and Iraq once confirm the fact that the security of the entire region is threatened.
The United Nations has a special responsibility, for it should not merely draw the attention of the international family to the dangers inherent in the acquisition of these weapons of mass destruction by Israelis, but it should also take the necessary actions to eliminate this threat.
There is no doubt that international terrorism is a phenomenon which is a source of grave and growing concern for the international community because it results in the loss of innocent lives and threatens people's peace and security. It also wreaks havoc and undermines confidence on the level of international relations. We share the conviction of the international community concerning the need to combat all forms of international terrorism. As we take up this phenomenon once more at this session, we notice with regret that international endeavours have fallen short of addressing this particular problem. This is due mainly to the fact that there are forms of international terrorism we have neither touched upon nor duly examined. One of these forms of terrorism whose danger has increased is State terrorism. This has prompted my country strongly to support the convening, under the auspices of the United Nations, of an international conference to define the concept of terrorism, and to support the need to develop specific international criteria to ensure that a clear distinction is made between terrorism that should be fought and eradicated on the one hand and the lawful struggle of peoples on the other. We sincerely hope that the legal committee, the Sixth Committee, will be able, during the current session, to take action to enable us to launch an objective and meaningful international dialogue on this issue.
My country shares the deep and growing concern of the international community at the grave imbalance in present international economic relations, resulting mainly from the unjust bases on which the international economic order was built. This order took shape under international circumstances which were entirely different from today's realities. Third-world countries, which today represent the majority of the international community, ace suffering from the negative and serious consequences of this imbalance.
Numerous manifestations of this suffering can be found in a multitude of problems, of which I shall give a few illustrations: the sharp decline in the prices of commodities, the doubling of the external debt burden of developing countries, the depletion of their financial resources and the prevalence of poverty, famine, disease and excessive protectionism in international trade, as well as the imposition of unfair terms of trade. In addition, economic coercion policies are being adopted by certain developed countries by way of economic embargoes and blockades.
This unjust economic order has become an insurmountable obstacle facing developing countries. Hence, the call for the establishment of a new international economic order. This just demand will remain out of reach owing to the obduracy and stubbornness of certain developed countries, whose inflexibility has aggravated and complicated the problems of developing countries especially in the 1980s, which can be termed the lost decade of development.
We believe that the developing countries should not be over-optimistic about the results of the so-called North-South dialogue, because the developed countries have shown that they only care for their selfish interests regardless of the urgent needs of the developing countries.
Changing the unfair economic order of today's world begins with solidarity and cohesion among those who suffer from injustice and with the promotion of co-operation among them. That is the positive way of attempting to persuade others. I do not deny that this course requires further sacrifices from us that may at first add to our problems, but it remains the only promising approach. To continue to resign ourselves to the existing relationships would mean that we had given up hope.
Talking about the world economy leads me to another, closely related issues the question of global environment, which is also of major concern to us all. The world is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis, about which nature is sending us urgent warnings that can be ignored only at our own peril. Numerous and growing indicators of this crisis are all around us. In addition to serious air pollution, there is desertification, soil erosion, depletion of forests, the greenhouse effect, unusual climatic changes and deterioration of the ozone layer. There is also the problem of nuclear and industrial toxic wastes, which has given rise to justifiable concern, especially in the third world, where scheming outsiders would dump such materials.
We have a collective responsibility to protect the environment. This surely calls for huge collective efforts; sporadic efforts will not be sufficient to achieve our goals in this field.
On the threshold of the twenty-first century, history dictates that we develop our potential and eliminate all the erroneous practices peculiar to the twentieth century. Policies of confrontation, threats and brandishing of power should be abandoned in favour of policies of rapprochement, dialogue, understanding and co-operation to establish the safe and prosperous international community of which our children dream.
May God enable us all to achieve that goal.
","The Mediterranean has become one of the most dangerous areas of tension in the world because of Zionist practices in and around occupied Palestine and because of the insistence of certain imperialist Powers on transforming the Mediterranean into a base for foreign military fleets and an arena for manoeuvres, provocation, including acts of air and naval piracy, as well as a launching pad for acts of direct aggression against certain States. As we applaud the persistent efforts made by the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the region, we renew our call for other littoral States of the Mediterranean to discharge their responsibilities and enter into a meaningful and balanced dialogue to establish strong and lasting bases for co-operation. My country wishes to reiterate that a just, lasting and peaceful settlement of this question should be based on the unity, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus, ridding it of foreign bases as well as guaranteeing the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities. My country shares the deep and growing concern of the international community at the grave imbalance in present international economic relations, resulting mainly from the unjust bases on which the international economic order was built. Changing the unfair economic order of today's world begins with solidarity and cohesion among those who suffer from injustice and with the promotion of co-operation among them."
44,1989,LKA,"ï»¿As Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, I appear before the Assembly for the first time to speak on behalf of my country. I am very happy to address these few words to the Assembly.
Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka, I wish to extend to Mr. Joseph Garba our warmest good wishes and congratulations on his election as President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Sri Lanka has close and cordial relations with Nigeria, not only at the bilateral level but also in the forums of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Commonwealth, in which we have closely co-operated. I should also like to express our appreciation for the manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, the Foreign Minister for Argentina, presided over the forty-third session.
May I take this opportunity to convey to Ambassador Garba the greetings and good wishes of His Excellency Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa, the President of Sri Lanka, and the people of Sri Lanka and, through him, to all the representatives assembled here today.
We live in a time of change, a time of uncertainty, as well as a time of promise and hope. Each of us, the powerful and the weak alike, must respond to the challenge of change. As individual independent States we must provide, in our domestic context, the equality of opportunity, the freedom and the support essential for our citizens to fulfil their aspirations. As a global community, we need to respond collectively to the challenge of rapidly evolving international developments and conduct our political and economic relations with each other to ensure the benefit of the entire world community.
The nexus between day-to-day occurrences in our own nations and broader global developments is dramatically brought into focus at the General Assembly each year. Here each representative brings before this parliament of nations the hopes and expectations that motivate his people as well as the fears and frustrations that blight their security and well-being. It is evident in these presentations that what most of us are unable to achieve through our individual and separate endeavours we need to approach as joint ventures in international co-operation. Our national options are often circumscribed by factors that lie beyond our national boundaries. That is equally true of political and economic matters.
Developing countries like my own are affected by the momentous transformations taking place at the present time in international economic relations. Science and technology are revolutionizing traditional patterns of industrial activity and production. Centrally planned economic systems are being radically restructured, with decision-making being decentralized and economic freedom being encouraged. A process of integration or globalisation transcending national frontiers is
fundamentally transforming financial and other markets. Integration of some key sectors of the world economy has led to a diffusion of economic power and the emergence of new centres of influence. 1992 will usher a new economic force into operation. As part of the relaxation of political tensions, co-operation between systems previously thought to be irreconcilable is further enhancing the process of integration. World economic output in 1988 expanded more than had been expected. International trade and investments grew vigorously.
The number of developing countries with growth rates in excess of 5 per cent increased as well, but for most developing countries whose economies have felt the ripples of these trends the economic environment has remained unfavourable, even hostile. Growth rates have stagnated or registered a decline. Prices for the products of developing countries have fluctuated to their detriment. While our products have indeed been competitive, many have nevertheless sustained losses in overall returns, having to contend with forbidding obstacles of quotas, tariff and non-tariff barriers and other restrictions which limit access to markets.
One can argue about the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and commitments undertaken in the Uruguay Round aimed at an equitable global system of trade exchanges. The telling reality is, however, that the percentage share of the developing countries in international trade exchanges has deteriorated from about 25 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s to below 20 per cent last year. Trade is a vital life-line for developing countries.
At the summit conference of the non-aligned countries in Belgrade, which I attended, the leaders of over 100 States emphasized the vital need for the interests of the developing countries to be adequately reflected in sectors of special importance to them, such as textiles and clothing, agricultural products, tropical products and natural-resource-based products.
It is essential that sustained efforts be exerted, including those within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to stabilize commodity prices at an adequately remunerative level. Reasonable commodity prices and fair market access for developing countries' trade would be more welcome than infusions of aid. What is required is steady, predictable export earnings for developing countries which they could deploy to combat poverty and want.
Sri Lanka has initiated innovative methods for the alleviation of poverty by seeking to tap the latent productive energies and rich creativity of the very segments of our population that are most adversely affected. These segments of our population have for too long been considered dependent. The Janasaviya movement - as it is called - has been set in motion to encourage about a million poor families to participate in the national productive endeavour, which could eventually involve even their entry into the export sector as well.
One of the main factors in society that makes poverty especially intractable is homelessness. Shanties, slums and other sub-human dwellings: they are the lot of countless millions of people in the developing world today. It is his deep awareness that investment in housing necessarily means disinvestment in poverty that led my President, His Excellency Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa, then Prime Minister, to propose to the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session that an international year be designated to advance the cause of shelter for the homeless in the world. The international community responded to his call, and 198? became the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.
As part of our own response to the challenge of alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka, we have taken many strides forward in our housing programmes. A programme for constructing 100,000 houses was completed. It was followed by a programme of building 1 million houses. We are now engaged in developing and implementing a programme of building an additional 1.5 million houses. We shall continue to build on these programmes. We shall constantly raise our targets. As the country that proposed international action for ending the scourge of homelessness, we are committed to achieving the United Nations target of shelter for all by the year 2000 ahead of that year.
A further initiative being considered by Sri Lanka concerns the development of the resources of the oceans. Despite the rich promise of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, many developing countries have still been unable to reap its full potential owing to insufficient awareness and the lack of national capabilities in the ocean sector. My delegation hopes to present an initiative at the session this year with the objective of launching an endeavour at the global level aimed at the realization of the benefits of ocean development. Sri Lanka looks forward to the suggestions and support of other members.
In an adverse economic climate, developing countries faced with the political and social imperative of providing for the well-being of their people have slipped into the deeper and more deadly snare of debt. The external debt of developing countries is new over 31,320 billion. Such astronomically high debts and debt service ratios have exhausted the economies of many developing countries. The situation has indeed deteriorated to such an extent that the net outflow of resources from the developing world to the developed economies exceeds the much-vaunted aid transfusions. At the level of the aggregate of the capital- importing developing countries, 1989 will mark the seventh consecutive year of such negative transfers. Sri Lanka, relatively better placed, nevertheless has a rising debt service ratio of 28.7 per cent. This negates what advances have been made in promoting export earnings. It restricts resources for investment, holds back the maintenance and development of infrastructure and inhibits long-term improvements in the economy.
Developing countries have also negotiated assistance and support from the major multilateral financial institutions for agreed economic programmes of a remedial or development-oriented nature. Such support, which has undoubtedly brought relief, has not always been available without a heavy price tag to be paid in political and social currency. Assistance and support has been forthcoming only on the basis of prior assent to certain policy prescriptions to be faithfully followed by the recipient State. The formula is familiar: restructuring of sectors of the economy, submission to realistic exchange rates - that is, effective devaluation? liberalization of import regulations? budget austerities compelling reduction or removal of consumer subsidies and other welfare benefits which have cushioned the poor? rationalization of the State sector and perhaps privatisation.
Stringent conditionally has been an inevitable element in assistance from multilateral institution::. Compliance often entails the imposition of unbearable economic and social burdens on the people and the real prospect, consequently, of political agitation, unrest and even violence. Nan-compliance, on the other hand, can possibly mean an interruption, or even a cut-off, in support from the institutions concerned. It could also involve a diminution in the country's image of 'aid-worthiness', with attendant consequences in its bilateral relations with donor countries. Here too, the nexus between political realities and economic exigencies becomes acutely evident. The multilateral institutions would do a major service it they took fuller account of the political and social fallout that awaits a country whose burden of conditionality weighs heaviest on its people.
Sri Lanka, with a population of 17 million projected for 1990, won its independence 41 years ago. Its population then stood at 7 million. The decisive leering of the infant mortality rate from 140 per thousand before independence to 39 per thousand in the period 1980-1985 and the rise in life expectancy from 42 years before independence to over 70 years now are indices of the progress made by independent Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's immunization programmes among children, supported by the United Nations Children's Fund, will achieve their targets well before the stipulated date of December 1990. An advanced system of welfare facilities has been available to the population. These include free education, free medical services and subsidized food essentials and transport. A partial scaling-down of some of these facilities, partly brought about by the external environment I have described, a revolution of rising expectations and a complex of other political and social factors have led to frustration and unrest, particularly among our politically articulate youth, who account for about 44 per cent of Sri Lanka's population. Such frustrations have fuelled strong radical views. This has in turn led to a tragic state of violence in our society. A political dialogue to which all parties have been invited is now in progress to reconcile differences in approach to our current problems and to effect a speedy return to normalcy in the island. This situation needs to be differentiated from the developments which painfully forced Sri Lanka into world headlines in the early 1980s.
Coupled with ethnic considerations, a dangerous situation had arisen in the northern portions of the island. Violent militant groups within an ethnic minority, the Tamils, sought recourse to terrorism and violence to achieve their ends. It had reached a point in 1987 when, to deal with aspects of the problem which lay beyond our shores, Sri Lanka signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Treaty of July 1987. A measure of stability was felt in the immediate aftermath of the Treaty, when the militant groups agreed to eschew violence aid commence peaceful negotiations to redress their grievances. This period was all too short-lived. Despite the presence of peace-keeping forces sent to Sri Lanka in the context of the Treaty, a period of senseless violence and brutality recommenced in which civilians suffered a terrible toll.
An appeal was addressed to all militant groups by the President of Sri Lanka that they enter the mainstream of the peaceful democratic process. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Belam have responded positively, and the Sri Lankan Government is now in the process of pursuing negotiations with its representatives.
The Sri Lankan Government has studied with interest the initiative of the Government of the Republic of Maldives in proposing that some mechanism should be devised within the United Nations to support the independence of small States in the event their security is threatened. The threat to small States nay be an external one; more usually, it comes in the form of involvement or intervention in
the internal affairs of small States. As developing countries, most of us face problems of national integration and consolidation. Ensuring social cohesion and harmony is another of our challenges. These problems we must face and resolve by the evolution of our own national life. External inputs dangerously inflame issues. Indeed, what served to aggravate the violence and insecurity of life in the north and east of Sri Lanka in recent years was the external support received by dissident groups. It militarised their campaign. It converted an essentially domestic conflict into one with international ramifications. It added new dimensions to the agony of the peoples of the region.
The non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade considered the question of international terrorism in all its forms. Heads of State at the summit noted that terrorism endangered the very territorial integrity and security of States. They called upon all States to fulfil their obligations under international law: obligations to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in other States, or acquiescing in activities within their territories which encourage the perpetration of such acts. An insidious link exists between international terrorism, drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade. Colombia's very survival as a State has been jeopardized by the evil plague of drugs. We applaud the efforts made by the President and Government of Colombia in combating this curse. The community of nations must, on a continuing basis, attack the unholy trinity of terrorism, drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade. The Belgrade summit of non-aligned States supported in principle the convening of a United Nations conference which would, inter alia, define terrorism to distinguish it from the legitimate struggle of peoples for national liberation - a struggle which resolutely continues in Palestine and South Africa.
As violence and insecurity continue in the region of the Middle East, support is universal for the convening of the International Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The question of Palestine remains at the crux of the prevailing unrest in the Middle East. A comprehensive settlement is not possible without the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. Only then could arrangements be guaranteed for the security of all States in the region within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.
In southern Africa, the hated system of apartheid perpetrates its vicious acts of violence and repression against the majority black people of South Africa. The racist regime continues to destabilize its independent African neighbours. Apartheid cannot be reformed. Only decisive action by the international community, not excluding the imposition of mandatory sanctions, can bring down the evil edifice of apartheid.
In Namibia, after facing several obstacles, we ate able to welcome the commencement of steps this year for the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence. Sri Lanka looks forward very much to receiving independent Namibia as a full Member of the Organization in the very near future.
Nearer home, in South-West Asia, we welcome the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. We note with concern, however, that peace has not been completely restored to that country. The free exercise of the right to self-determination by all the Afghan people and the return, in conditions of safety and honour, of Afghan refugees are indispensable to any comprehensive political settlement of the problem. In South-East Asia, we believe that conflict and tension can be eased only on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign forces and the exercise of the right of the people of Cambodia freely to determine their destiny without outside pressure.
The continued presence of foreign occupation forces in the Republic of Cyprus obstructs the achievement of a lasting solution to all aspects of the question. Sri Lanka strongly supports the independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. We encourage the Secretary-General to continue his mission of good offices, and we appeal to all parties involved to co-operate with him in a constructive spirit.
I have touched briefly on a number of issues which have been on the Assembly's agenda for several years. Despite the many obstacles which continue to hinder their solution, there is much that offers hope and promise.
In a broad sense, the new co-operative relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has eased tensions, particularly in Europe. We non-aligned States have had the opportunity to assess these developments at the summit conference held in Yugoslavia.
 In the field of disarmament, the prospect of progress is more than illusory. The Treaty on the Elimination of Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is an important step in a long journey which has just begun. The threat of nuclear annihilation has not been eliminated, and we are following with interest the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on reductions in their strategic offensive nuclear arsenals. It is essential that the process be widened to include other nuclear-weapon States as well and eventually lead to the complete elimination of these weapons of extinction. An immediate and comprehensive ban on nuclear testing meanwhile remains one of the highest priorities of disarmament, and Sri Lanka is one of over 40 States which have taken action to convene an amendment conference to convert the 1963 partial test-ban
Treaty into one that is comprehensive. That would also help to enhance the credibility of the nuclear-non-proliferation regime on the eve of the Review Conference.
As a member of the Conference on Disarmament, Sri Lanka firmly maintains that this single multilateral negotiating forum should not delay the commencement of substantive negotiations on all issues relating to nuclear disarmament and on the prevention of the arms race in outer space. We urge the Conference to conclude its work on a comprehensive and global convention banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction. Sri Lanka welcomes the initiative announced by the United States President, Mr. George Bush, to destroy all chemical weapons within a decade. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has the same desire to be rid of these barbaric weapons. That augurs well for all humanity.
Finally, let me briefly refer to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. The General Assembly has by a consensus decision called for the convening of the conference on the Indian Ocean in 1990 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to fulfil the objectives contained in the Declaration and considered by the littoral and hinterland States at their meeting in 1979. The Heads of State of the non-aligned countries at their ninth summit conference, in Belgrade, called for the full and active participation in the Conference by the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Ocean, whose co-operation is essential for the success of the Conference. We urge all States concerned to finalize preparatory work for the Conference to ensure its convening in 1990.
The agenda for this forty-fourth session covers a wide and varied diversity of items, including those of an economic, political, cultural and humanitarian character. Yet there is an intrinsic relationship between most of these items which makes difficult their consideration in complete isolation. A recurrent theme in our debate has been that many of our concerns require co-ordinated, global approaches that transcend national frontiers. For example, the children of the world are the hope and the future of the world. The concept of a world summit for children, endorsed by a number of world leaders, including my President, calls for global commitment and universal support. The possibilities and options open to an individual State for unilateral action are being increasingly circumscribed. All this emphasizes human interdependence.
Despite disparities in size and power, we are, all bound, therefore, to share a single planet and its resources. This requires that affairs among nations be so ordered as to ensure at least our very survival, not to speak of our development and progress. The cynical pursuit of myopic national interests through the inequitable deployment of political, military or economic muscle will negate our shared goals. Interdependence must therefore be a catalyst for co-operation on the principle of the sovereign equality of States on which our Organization is based.
","As individual independent States we must provide, in our domestic context, the equality of opportunity, the freedom and the support essential for our citizens to fulfil their aspirations. At the summit conference of the non-aligned countries in Belgrade, which I attended, the leaders of over 100 States emphasized the vital need for the interests of the developing countries to be adequately reflected in sectors of special importance to them, such as textiles and clothing, agricultural products, tropical products and natural-resource-based products. A partial scaling-down of some of these facilities, partly brought about by the external environment I have described, a revolution of rising expectations and a complex of other political and social factors have led to frustration and unrest, particularly among our politically articulate youth, who account for about 44 per cent of Sri Lanka's population. An immediate and comprehensive ban on nuclear testing meanwhile remains one of the highest priorities of disarmament, and Sri Lanka is one of over 40 States which have taken action to convene an amendment conference to convert the 1963 partial test-ban
Treaty into one that is comprehensive. We urge the Conference to conclude its work on a comprehensive and global convention banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction."

My delegation congratulates you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. You bring to this office a wealth of experience and diplomatic skill which assures us of your ability to guide the proceedings of this session to a successful conclusion. Your election is also a fitting tribute to your great country, Nigeria, with which Tanzania enjoys excellent relations, aid to the role Nigeria plays in the furtherance of African aspirations in pursuance of international peace and security, understanding and cooperation. My delegation is therefore happy to see you preside over the Assembly and it is with pleasure that I Pledge my delegate's cooperation in the discharge of the responsibilities which the Assembly has placed on you.
Your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, presided over the deliberations of the Assembly at its forty-third session with exemplary skill, dedication and steadfastness. I wish to record my appreciation of his work and to extend to him my best wishes in his future undertakings.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, has continued to serve this noble Organization with untiring efforts and unswerving dedication. I wish to pay a special tribute to him. His duties are both daunting and challenging, but over the years we have come to expect of him both perseverance and wisdom as he undertakes difficult missions and pursues delicate negotiations. Tanzania renews its oft-stated support for the Secretary-General and for the United Nations. This Organization remains the hope of mankind and its survival. Its universality provides us with a forum in which we fashion a common purpose, chart a common path aid co-operate for the benefit of our common interests.
Last month saw the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, the devastating effects of which are unparalleled in the history of mankind, Today our world is still suffering from the effects of that war. For this reason the search for world peace continues to be pressing. It must transcend national borders, race, colour and ideology. But peace and oppression are mutually exclusive for there cannot be peace where there is oppression. Everywhere - in Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Asia and Africa - oppression of whatever kind must be condemned and it must be ended.
The worst manifestation of oppression in the world today is the system of apartheid practised by the Pretoria regime. Just as Nazism, 50 years ago, denied the humanity of its victims because of their race, so today apartheid, that evil system of institutionalised racism, denies the humanity of the majority of the people of South Africa because of the colour of their skin. In recent years. apartheid has taken on a new dimension, manifested in acts of aggression aid destabilization of South Africa's neighbours. Each time the international community brought pressure to bear on South Africa because of its apartheid policies, the regime has come out with diversionary tactics aimed at misleading the international community into believing that meaningful changes were being undertaken. At present South Africa has put forward a so-called programme to end apartheid. In fact, no fundamental and genuine reforms are envisaged. The international community must recognize that these are the same old tricks that the regime has used in the past to ward off international pressure.
We must not be deceived. The change in the State President in South Africa does not represent a change in policy. As one leader of the oppressed black people of South Africa has warned, what has happened is that what the racists have done is to get a more competent navigator for the ship of apartheid; but that ship maintains its direction.
The world does not have to look far to prove this. As late as last Friday, the South African Government hanged an activist of the African National Congress, Geoffrey Busman Magenta, in blatant defiance of appeals for clemency from a body of no less stature than this Assembly. What further evidence do we need to prove that apartheid is not about to be reformed, rather that it is on the march? The international community must intensify its pressure on the Pretoria regime with a view to abolishing apartheid.
Africa has stated its position with regard to the opening of negotiations for a peaceful solution of the South African crisis through the Harare Declaration. The pre-conditions that would be an earnest of serious intent by the apartheid regime include the lifting of the state of emergency; the release of political prisoners, particularly Nelson Mandela; a halt to political executions and detentions; the withdrawal of the army from the townships; the removal of the ban on political parties; and the return of all political exiles without hindrance.
The new Government in South Africa has not stated unambiguously to the world that it will abolish apartheid and work towards the creation of a united, democratic, non-racial South Africa. Neither is it ready for a meaningful dialogue with the true representatives of the oppressed people of South Africa. Until those conditions are fulfilled, pressure on the apartheid regime mist be stepped up, not relaxed. Tanzania shall continue to press for the imposition on the Pretoria regime of comprehensive, mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.
Elsewhere in southern Africa, the Pretoria regime continues to offer material and political support to dissident and bandit groups fighting lawful Governments. In Angola the support given to UNITA by South Africa and the United States Administration is completely unjustified and reprehensible; it makes it impossible to attain a quick and honourable internal reconciliation in Angola. In Mozambique, the Pretoria regime has not ceased its support to the RSNAMO bandits, who continue to commit massacres and destroy infrastructure and property. Tanzania calls upon the international community to condemn these acts of destabilization by the Pretoria regime which have led to the loss of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in property in the front-line States and other neighbouring countries. The international community cannot afford to remain indifferent to these heinous crimes committed by the Pretoria regime. For apartheid is a crime against humanity and the war against it should be global and universal.
Six months have passed since the commencement of the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). On 7 November 1989 the people of Namibia will be taking part, for the first time, in what are hoped will be democratic elections under United Nations supervision. We are seriously concerned over the implementation of the plan in view of South Africa's continued flagrant violation of the provisions of the plat. We are perturbed by the electoral procedures adopted by the South African Administrator-General which allowed the registration, as voters, of South Africans and other non-Namibians. We are further concerned over the proposed electoral law, which lacks the provision for secrecy in the ballot box. We call on the Secretary-General to ensure that the forthcoming elections in Namibia are indeed free and fair, so as to produce a government that truly represents the wishes of the majority of the Namibian people.
In other conflicts on the African continent, efforts to bring about peace continue. Tanzania supports the role played by the United Nations in conjunction with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the search for a resolution of the Western Sahara problem. The meeting in Marrakech between His Majesty King Hassan II and a delegation from the POL IS ARID Front was a positive step towards the establishment of a dialogue between the parties. We regret very much that projected further meetings have not taken place and we express the hope that the dialogue will expeditiously resume. Meanwhile, we support the efforts of the Secretary-General in trying to arrange for the holding of a referendum so as to ensure that the Sahraoui people enjoy self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).
The continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories, including parts of southern Lebanon, is unacceptable. This occupation is in defiance of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. The massacres, brutal arrests, detentions, deportations and kidnappings perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people should be condemned by the international community.
History has shown that there can never be oppression without resistance. The tenacious and heroic struggle of the Palestinians - the intifadah - has demonstrated the unparalleled will of an oppressed people to fight for their freedom. We applaud the Palestinian people for their resolve while deploring Israeli Government intransigence in ignoring international public opinion. We call upon the Security Council to convene without delay the International Conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, in order to (hart out a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis. The permanent members of the Security Council should participate fully in the Conference, which must of necessity involve all the parties concerned, including the State of Palestine. We call on Israel to give peace a chance by agreeing to participate in the Conference.
The situation in the Gulf is less tense now than a few years back but Security Council resolution 598 (1987) has not been fully implemented. We urge the parties concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General so that the cease-fire can be strengthened as the foundation for a lasting peace. Meanwhile, we should continue to support the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group as it discharges its very heavy responsibilities.
The question of Cyprus has remained on the agenda of the Assembly for many years. It is now 15 years since part of the Republic of Cyprus was occupied by an external Power, resulting in the separation of families, the exodus of refugees and the wanton destruction of property. Tanzania supports the Secretary-General in his endeavours to promote a just solution to the problem of Cyprus. We call upon the Turkish and Greek communities to show restraint. We reiterate our solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus in their efforts to preserve the independence, sovereignty and unity of their Republic.
Although foreign troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan, peace has not been restored to that country. The Geneva Agreements, meant to usher in peace, have not been respected by some of the parties concerned and external interference has hindered genuine national reconciliation and reconstruction. The people of Afghanistan yearn for peace, and we call upon all the parties to the Geneva Agreements to facilitate an early aid comprehensive political settlement in Afghanistan.
Tension still lingers on in the Korean peninsula. The will and determination of the Korean people for reunification under a formula agreed upon by both the North and the South should be respected and not interfered with. The withdrawal of foreign troops from the area will pave the way for a peaceful transition to the reunification of Korea.
We welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and hail the Jakarta Informal Meetings, which have contributed significantly to the search for a comprehensive solution to the problem. The Paris Conference, which was held in August, was a commendable step towards the achievement of national reconciliation and unity. We urge the different factions to the conflict, with the assistance of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, to continue in their search for a peaceful settlement in Cambodia and the establishment of peace, freedom and neutrality in the countries of the region.
The situation in Central America, if not checked, could adversely affect the relaxation of tension in the international political arena. Foreign interference and foreign military intervention, support for subversion and the application of economic blockades have plunged the region into turmoil and undermined the sustained diplomatic efforts by the countries in the region to solve their own problems through dialogue. Tanzania supports the peace agreements concluded by Central American countries and reiterates that peace, development and democracy in Central America should be based on respect for the independence and self-determination of countries and peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. In particular, we urge the cessation of all hostile acts against Nicaragua.
We have witnessed a relaxation in world tension as a result of the rapprochement between the super-Powers, as highlighted by the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - in December 1987. We commend the super-Powers for their courage and for their realization that world peace was not served by continued, implacable, confrontational hostility towards each other. Yet this rapprochement, vital aid welcome as it is, has not advanced sufficiently the prospect of a stable world peace. The arsenals of both conventional and nuclear weapons remain at alarming levels and we are confronted with more refined and deadly weapons. Tanzania wishes to see a definite movement in the process of nuclear disarmament negotiations. The necessity of adopting measures for achieving nuclear disarmament, with the ultimate goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons, cannot be overemphasized. We therefore call for an immediate ban on nuclear testing. Although bilateral negotiations by the super-Powers are vital, Tanzania believes that the United Nations should play a central role in the field of disarmament. All men everywhere yearn for peace and their fate cannot be left exclusively in the hands of a few countries, even though they are the most powerful.
Of late the international community has accorded the issues of the environment their rightful significance. For many years man has abused his environment through the depletion of the ozone layer, deforestation and the dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes which now threaten the very survival of mankind. It is encouraging to see that the world is awakening and joining hand3 in unison in the search for a solution to this common threat to our common interest of survival. My country supports, and will positively contribute to, international efforts and co-operation in preserving our environment.
For universal peace and security to be realized there has to be corresponding economic aid social development. In the early 1970s the developing countries alerted the world community to the monumental deficiencies of the existing global, economic aid financial system, which does not benefit the economies of the developing countries. The dangers and seriousness of the situation were manifested by the breakdown of the Bretton Woods Agreement on the monetary aid financial system and the ever-widening gap in economic growth and development between the developed and the developing countries. The latter then called upon the international community for a change in the world economic arrangement. This body was quick to respond to that call and since then the General Assembly has persistently adopted resolutions calling for the establishment of a new international economic order. Regrettably, these resolutions have not been taken up for implementation.
The need to establish a new economic system of this kind is more urgent today than it was 20 years ago. For the developing countries, the 1970s and the 1980s are lost decades for development. However, the world economy is changing: today, no single country can claim economic dominance over others. Therefore, a fair and just international economic system is for the mutual benefit of the developed and the developing countries. It is only through such an economic system that today's pressing global economic problems can be adequately redressed.
The economic problems that have plagued the developing countries during the last decade need special attention. Some were caused by natural disasters such as floods and drought, which in turn caused hunger and famine. Others were man-made, such as the debt crisis, and have caused severe economic strains on the developing countries. The resultant lopsided international economic relationship between the developed and the developing countries has thus caused international monetary instability and unpredictable world markets for the commodities of the developing countries. With this world economic trend of the 1980s there was a net transfer of resources from the developing countries through debt servicing and high interest rates. There has also been an enormous reduction of financial flows from the developed countries to the developing countries, so that few developed countries have been able to reach the 0.7 per cent of gross national product target for official development assistance. Moreover, the 1980s have seen a further deterioration in terms of trade, and falling prices for the primary commodities of the developing countries in world markets.
In addressing these problems, developing countries have initiated several measures. For its part, Africa, under the auspices of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), established the Lagos Plan of Action for the development of the continent from 1980 to 2000. In addition, it responded to its severe economic situation by adopting the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery. This was later incorporated in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. These efforts have not succeeded in alleviating the economic problems of Africa for the simple reason that the current economic system does not create a conducive economic climate for the reconstruction of environmentally sound and sustainable economies for the developing countries. This situation if further exacerbated by the tardiness displayed by the developed countries with regard to support for the United Nations Programme of Action. My delegation hopes that the plan end aspirations set forth in that Programme, which is scheduled to end next year, will be carried forward until all of its objectives are achieved, including the finding of a permanent solution to the external debt crisis. Also, we make a vigorous appeal to the international community to support the holding of an international conference on Africa indebtedness.
My delegation is deeply concerned with the explosive nature of the external debt crisis. However, my country wishes to pay a tribute to all those countries which have taken up positive relief measures such as cancelling some or all of the debts owed them by certain third world countries as a response to the existing realities. These short-term solutions, welcome as they are, must be followed by long-term radical changes in the system, which will lead to a new economic system, a system which will ensure fair and predictable prices in the world market for primary commodities from the developing countries, fair terms of trade aid adequate resource flows to these countries. My delegation thus welcomes the entry into force this year of the Common Fund for Commodities under the auspices of the United Nations and hopes the Rind will boost the efforts of the primary commodity producers and exporters. We call upon all Member States to give strong support to the Fund to enable it to discharge its functions with great efficiency and effectiveness.
We have foliated closely current negotiations on trade and development in the ongoing Uruguay Round, which is approaching its end. We are greatly concerned that these negotiations should not ignore the trading needs of the developing countries, in particular the elimination of the overt and covert protectionism practised by some of the developed countries against products from the third world countries. The outcome of the Uruguay Round should not lock developing countries into a new, more unjust world trading system. Further concerted efforts are needed to solve the world's inherent economic problems. The positive economic trends in the developed countries cannot be sustained for long if the economies of the developing countries continue to experience negative trends, nor is it fair for the economies of the developed countries to continue enjoying healthy growth at the expense of the poor economies of the third world countries.
In the same spirit, my delegation welcomes the holding in April 1990 of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international co-operation, particularly in respect of the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries, and calls upon Member States to adopt, by consensus, the proposed new international development strategy for the 1990s, which should address the current global economic problems.
The thawing of relations between the great Powers must be deployed positively to assist, among other things, the social, economic and political development of third world countries. This is an auspicious and historic period, for, if the big nations of the world so wish, the world can be a better and more prosperous place to live in, not just for a few nations, but for all of us. 
We are now confronted with a host of new-generation problems, including the threat to the environment, international terrorism and the menace of drugs. Countries of the world have all risen up against the curse of drugs and drug abuse. This realization of a common threat to mankind and future generations is a positive one, and my country readily pins hands with all those nations resolved to put an end to this terrible phenomenon.
The threat to life and Property posed by the incidence of individual and State-sponsored terrorism remains. My country condemns every form of terrorism, whether State-sanctioned or otherwise. The maintenance of a stable international political order demands respect for the rule of international law. Once universally accepted, observance of international law cannot depend on whim, for it is one of the corner-stones of international security and a fundamental safeguard against interference by Member States in each other's internal affairs.
We should continue aiding international organizations and agencies which give assistance to refugees and victims of natural disasters. My country and the entire African continent knows the agony that these people go through, z ask that this Organization should continue to give prominence to the work of the High Commissioner for Refugees so that those without hope can find hope again, so that the homeless can build homes again, and so that the needy can be assured of a helping hand. 
In conclusion, let me underline my country's satisfaction at the thawing of relations between the two super-Powers aid the consequent reduction in tension among nations. My hope is that this positive climate will produce more than handshakes aid self-congratulatory speeches. We must ensure that we reach a just and equitable economic order which will be conducive to rapid and sustained economic growth in third world countries, for without economic development there is little hope for sustained international peace and security. To secure international peace and security is the overriding purpose of the United Nations. I renew Tanzania's consent to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations and its agencies aid Tanzania's support for their work, work upon which rests the promise of a stable future for the community of nations. 
","Foreign interference and foreign military intervention, support for subversion and the application of economic blockades have plunged the region into turmoil and undermined the sustained diplomatic efforts by the countries in the region to solve their own problems through dialogue. These short-term solutions, welcome as they are, must be followed by long-term radical changes in the system, which will lead to a new economic system, a system which will ensure fair and predictable prices in the world market for primary commodities from the developing countries, fair terms of trade aid adequate resource flows to these countries. We are greatly concerned that these negotiations should not ignore the trading needs of the developing countries, in particular the elimination of the overt and covert protectionism practised by some of the developed countries against products from the third world countries. The positive economic trends in the developed countries cannot be sustained for long if the economies of the developing countries continue to experience negative trends, nor is it fair for the economies of the developed countries to continue enjoying healthy growth at the expense of the poor economies of the third world countries. We must ensure that we reach a just and equitable economic order which will be conducive to rapid and sustained economic growth in third world countries, for without economic development there is little hope for sustained international peace and security."
44,1989,SGP,"ï»¿First of all, let me congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your unique and illustrious background as soldier, political leader, scholar aid author, and your wide experience in multilateral diplomacy will no doubt provide you with the particular sensitivity and skills required to guide us through the complex issues of the United Nations agenda. My delegation has absolute confidence in your abilities. We pledge our fullest co-operation. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Ronald Spiers on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services. I am confident that he will bring to his responsibilities the highest degree of professionalism, which was the hallmark of his predecessor. May I also express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo for carrying out his duties so diligently and admirably during the last session.
Last year was an exceptionally good year for the United Nations. For the international community, long used to the unending eruption of wars, disputes and conflicts, never had the promise of peace been so close to realization. Agreements were reached to end the war in Afghanistan and to establish a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. In December, agreement was also reached to usher in Namibia's transition to independence. The United Nations peace-keeping forces were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their contribution to peace-keeping. Multilateral diplomacy was patently yielding results. The prestige of the United Nations had never been greater.
This year, in 1989, we are a little less euphoric. We are sobered by the realities and the difficulties of the resolution of conflicts among nations. While some progress has been achieved on several fronts, we are keenly aware of the problems that still stand in the way of peace. Eight months after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the fighting and the killings have not abated. The talks to end the Iran-Iraq conflict have stalled. We are alarmed at the worsening situation in Lebanon and the stalemate, if not retrogression, in spite of earlier progress, in the resolution of the question of Palestine. We await the long overdue birth of independence in Namibia with the keenest interest. 
Singapore feels privileged to be able to contribute to the achievement of this goal through our participation in the united Nations Transition Assistance Group police contingent. We are also honoured that the leader of our police contingent, Superintendent lee Kok Leong, has been appointed chief electoral officer to oversee elections in Namibia. But we are disturbed at the attempts by South Africa to circumvent the implementation of some key aspects of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We must continue our vigilance to ensure that nothing will derail the transition to independence aid prevent the full implementation of free aid fair elections in November. After Namibia, the international community should help to hasten the pace of fundamental change in South Africa to end the abhorrent and evil apartheid system.
The Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, in summing up the problems of peace-making in his report on the work of the Organization, said:
'I am all too conscious how thorny is often the path leading to a just and lasting settlement aid how hard is the resistance encountered.' (A/44/1, p. 12) I fully agree with him. If there is a lesson to be learned in all this, it is that there is no quick fix to peace.
When a major Power comes to the conclusion that military power cannot be used to achieve political objectives and that dialogue with a global rival is more fruitful than confrontation, it ushers in a more auspicious international climate. But we have clearly learned this year that even when the major Powers are prepared to settle their conflicts a necessary but insufficient condition for the attainment of peace has been met. The key that unlocks the door to peace in regional conflicts is often in the hands of the parties directly involved. All that is needed is one inflexible and intransigent party to block the peace process.
We are also aware that, even as we have to work harder on the problems of international and regional conflicts, a new generation of problems compelling urgent attention has come on out agenda - problems such as drugs, the environment, refugees and debt. Those problems recognize no borders and, if left unattended, could complicate and threaten the wider and long-term security of the international community and our search for peace.
Among the nations in South-East Asia, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a whole has done well. We have progressed because our national stability has allowed each of us to concentrate our attention on our internal political, social and economic development. This in turn contributes to ASEAN's resilience and cohesion. We had hoped that the same peaceful and stabilizing conditions would be achieved in Indo-China, but, alas, the Cambodian conflict remains an intractable problem. It is now 11 years since the Cambodian issue was first brought before the Security Council in January 1979 after Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day in 1978.
For 10 years the international community spoke through the United Nations resolutions, calling upon Viet Nam to end its occupation of Cambodia and to accept a comprehensive political settlement which would bring lasting peace to the region. Such a comprehensive political settlement would provide, among other things, for the withdrawal of foreign forces under effective international supervision and control, the creation of an interim administrative authority, the promotion of national reconciliation under Prince Sihanouk and the right of the Cambodian people to choose their own leaders free from outside interference.
Our efforts at the United Nations were not without impact. Initially, Viet Nam denied that its troops had invaded Cambodia. later, when this untruth was exposed, Viet Nam arrogantly declared that the situation in Cambodia was irreversible. But continued United Nations pressure and international isolation, denying Viet Nam valuable aid and investment, forced it to concede for the first time, in 1986, that it was prepared to reach a political solution. What Viet Nam had not taken into account was the strength and resilience of the Cambodian nationalist resistance. The high cost of foreign occupation brought its economy to the brink of bankruptcy. Now that the Soviet Union is keen to reduce its burdens abroad, the option of a continued Vietnamese presence in Cambodia cannot be ensured. Viet Nam has readied a point where it has to reconsider its strategy.
On 5 April this year Viet Nam dramatically announced to the world its intention to withdraw ail its troops from Cambodia by the end of September. In recent days, we have seen photographs and newspaper reports of Vietnamese soldiers departing in military trucks. It is certainly a major media event, but what are we as responsible Governments to make of this announced withdrawal? Are we to conclude that the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia ended on 26 September as Viet Nam claims it did? Are we to conclude that the problems of Cambodia are now all resolved? Is there no further need for the United Nations to continue to debate and discuss the issue of Cambodia?
The most significant point to note about the announced withdrawal is that, first, it is a unilateral withdrawal undertaken without a comprehensive political settlement in place. The withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops has not been effectively verified. We have no way of knowing if the withdrawal is genuine and total. There was only a handful of media journalists, several observers from some non-governmental organizations and representatives of the few countries that have
diplomatic relations with the Him Sen regime who had gene to Phnom Penh to observe the Vietnamese departure This motley group could not honestly verify that there are now no more Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Indeed, the united Nations technical fact-finding mission dispatched on agreement by the Paris Conference on Cambodia reported that even in the best of circumstances it would be difficult to verify satisfactorily the exit of the Vietnamese troops. The terrain and the poor infrastructure and transportation system in Cambodia makes systematic supervision and control very difficult.
Secondly, this is the eighth time that the Vietnamese have claimed to have withdrawn their forces from Cambodia. In the past, as in July 1982, May 1983, Jime 1984, April 1985 and May 1986, Viet Nam had said that it was withdrawing its troops from Cambodia, but each time we learned that those withdrawals amounted to no more than a rotation of troops. We are therefore justified in being sceptical about the present withdrawal. Our scepticism is supported by an article in the 27 September issue of the Bangkok Post which reported that some East European sources had told its correspondent, Mr. Jacques Bekaart, that some Vietnamese troops had been left behind in Cambodia.
Thirdly, there still remains the vital question of Vietnamese soldiers who are staying behind as militia of the Hun Sen regime aid as settlers. Viet Nam has not contested the existence of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. The argument is over the numbers. Viet Nam claims feat there are 80,000 Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk says there are about 1.3 million. Some Western diplomats in the region estimate the figure to be between 300,000 aid 400,000. The issue of the number of settlers is important as this determines who has a right to vote in the internationally supervised free aid fair elections that come with a comprehensive settlement, and therefore the right to choose the Government of Cambodia.
In my case, Viet Nam has not entirely relinquished its right to intervene again in the affairs of Cambodia. In several statements made since the 5 April announcement of Viet Nam's intention to withdraw by the end of September, Viet Nam has asserted its right to send its troops, or whatever other assistance, to Phnom Perti if it feels that the survival of its puppet regime is threatened by resistance guerrillas.
There are therefore considerable doubts whether the Vietnamese have completely withdrawn from Cambodia. However, even if we could document that Viet Nam had completely withdrawn its forces, I submit that the United Nations should still continue to debate and discuss fee Cambodian issue. Some nay argue that the united Nations role should be limited to discussing violations of the United Nations Charter and that united Nations interest in Cambodia should cease when foreign intervention there ends. 'A> understand the fallacy of this argument, let me cite an analogy* if the South Africans decided to withdraw their forces from Namibia but insisted cm leaving in place the Windhoek regime as the exclusive Government of Namibia, without giving the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) the right to compete in fairly held elections, we would immediately denounce South Africa aid declare that fee Windhoek regime had no legitimate right to rule Namibia since it was installed by foreign occupation forces.
That is precisely what Viet Nam is trying to do in Cambodia. After withdrawing most of its forces, it continues to insist that the Hun Sen regime, which was put in place by the foreign occupation forces, should continue to rule Cambodia. That is why the Paris Conference failed. The three Cambodian parties led by Prince Sihanouk, which are recognized as fee legitimate representatives of the Cambodian people by the Assembly, by the United Nations, were willing to share power with Mr. Him Sen in an interim quadripartite coalition Government until free, fair and democratic elections were held under united Nations supervision. They were prepared to allow the Cambodian people to determine who should rule them, demonstrating their commitment to the most fundamental principle of the United Nations Charters that a people's right to self-determination should never be diminished.
Viet Nam and Mr. Him Sen opposed this, declaring that Mr. Hun Sen should enjoy a monopoly, or near-monopoly, of power in Phnom Penh. They knew that by doing so they would give the nationalist forces led by Prince Sihanouk no choice but to launch a military struggle to secure their legitimate right to self-determination. Both Viet Nam and Mr. Hun Sen want to trigger off this civil war. We are sad that the Cambodian people, who have now suffered fear almost 20 years, continue to live in agony. But it is Viet Nam and Mr. Hun Sen who are responsible for this state of affairs, and they should be condemned for it.
After raising the hopes of the Cambodian people through our principled and moral stand over the past 10 years, we cannot disappoint them by abandoning them at this crucial hour when they are so near to securing real liberation. The United Nations can and should help the Cambodian people by insisting that there should be a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem. The international community must insist that it can never accept anything less than this. Such a comprehensive political settlement must give the Cambodian people the right to determine their own future in free, fair and democratic elections under international supervision. Only this will end the civil war and allow the Cambodian people to breathe freely again.
The exercise of self-determination in Cambodia must be based on national reconciliation of all Cambodian parties. All parties must have a stake in the future of Cambodia, lb attempt to exclude any party as a pre-condition for national reconciliation is unrealistic and irresponsible. It is tantamount to inciting the prolongation of conflict and bloodshed. That is why Prince Sihanouk has wisely and realistically called for the formation of an interim quadripartite Government of all four Cambodian parties. This interim quadripartite Government will have the responsibility of organizing free and fair elections. Since all parties will be involved in organizing the elections, all will be bound by the results.
No matter what we, as individual countries, may think about any Cambodian party, only the Cambodian people have the moral and political right to determine who should or should not rule Cambodia. Nobody else has that right. In exercising their right to self-determination through free and fair elections, the Cambodian people will finally be able to pass their verdict and judgement on the Khmer Rouge. The inter national community has the obligation to help create conditions that will enable the Cambodians to exercise freely their political choices, and to respect their choice, whatever it may be. The international community should recognize that the Cambodian people will have the wisdom to choose wisely.
Let me restate the central issues of the Cambodian problem. First, the total withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops must be verified by the United Nations, as only the United Nations can provide an effective international supervisory, monitoring and control mechanism. Secondly, the Cambodian people must have the opportunity to exercise the right of self-determination, which is a basic right of all peoples under the united Nations Charter. Thirdly, none of the Khmer parties should be denied the opportunity to stand for election under the comprehensive political settlement, as only the Cambodian people have the right to decide who should govern them; the exclusion of any party should not be made a pre-condition for a settlement agreement.
My country, Singapore, does not bear any historical animosity against Viet Nam. But why have Singapore and our Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners championed the cause of Cambodia so energetically in the past decade? We have done so because Viet Nam's invasion and occupation of Cambodia have threatened the peace and stability of South-East Asia. we have done so because Viet Nam's action, if not repudiated, would set a very unfortunate precedent. Viet Nam must not be allowed to get away with only partially solving the problem. If it succeeded, it would have demonstrated that aggression pays. It would have shown to others that it is possible for one country to invade another country with impunity, set up a client regime, and after a long enough interval walk away from the mess it created, leave a resistance war raging and go back to business-as-usual with the rest of the world. That would create a dangerous precedent. For all peace-loving States of the international community, we must not accept this dangerous precedent. It would put our security in jeopardy if this should become acceptable international behaviour.
The Cambodian issue has been a success story of the united Nations. This may sound paradoxical but it demonstrates that international moral pressure does work. Through the united Nations resolutions adapted year after year, with increasing support, we have forced Viet Nam to change its position over time. We have come this far. Viet Nam is taking the first step towards the resolution of the Cambodian question by thinning out its troops in the field. But the problem is far from being resolved. We at the united Nations must continue our moral suasion to convince Viet Nam that it has the responsibility to settle the Cambodian question comprehensively in the interest of a just and lasting peace for the Cambodians and in the interest of regional security and stability. When Viet Nam contributes to the comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian issue, peace will return to Indo-China. When there is peace in Indo-China, the international community will help in its reconstruction. Viet Nam will finally be able to concentrate on its cam internal economic and social development and reap the fruits of prosperity.
","But we have clearly learned this year that even when the major Powers are prepared to settle their conflicts a necessary but insufficient condition for the attainment of peace has been met. We are also aware that, even as we have to work harder on the problems of international and regional conflicts, a new generation of problems compelling urgent attention has come on out agenda - problems such as drugs, the environment, refugees and debt. Such a comprehensive political settlement would provide, among other things, for the withdrawal of foreign forces under effective international supervision and control, the creation of an interim administrative authority, the promotion of national reconciliation under Prince Sihanouk and the right of the Cambodian people to choose their own leaders free from outside interference. 'A> understand the fallacy of this argument, let me cite an analogy* if the South Africans decided to withdraw their forces from Namibia but insisted cm leaving in place the Windhoek regime as the exclusive Government of Namibia, without giving the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) the right to compete in fairly held elections, we would immediately denounce South Africa aid declare that fee Windhoek regime had no legitimate right to rule Namibia since it was installed by foreign occupation forces. Thirdly, none of the Khmer parties should be denied the opportunity to stand for election under the comprehensive political settlement, as only the Cambodian people have the right to decide who should govern them; the exclusion of any party should not be made a pre-condition for a settlement agreement."
44,1989,NOR,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure, Mr. President, to congratulate you upon your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I feel confident that you will guide our work to a successful conclusion.
The challenges that we face together are enormous. On the threshold of the last decade of this century, we shall have to wake choices and take decisions that will determine the course of human progress far into the next millennium. The unparalleled speed and scope of the changes now facing us are the most striking characteristic of our time. We are witnessing rapid globalisation.
Changes involve uncertainty. But change also involves opportunity. We must seize this opportunity. We must agree and act on a global agenda for the management of change. If we fail to act, or if we act wrongly, we may soon face a threat to our future.
We are living in a transitional period. The awareness of the conflicts between human activities and environmental constraints is literally exploding. Even today, the number of poor, illiterate or unemployed people in the world is growing. This finite world of ours will have to provide food and energy for a troubled world population sometime in the next century. It may have to sustain a world economy which is five or ten times larger than the present one. This cannot be done by perpetuating present patterns.
We have made some progress in our efforts to prevent war. But while nuclear war remains a long-term threat to our survival, the process of ecological degradation constitutes a clear and present danger. We are experiencing it in our daily life. It is increasingly visible everywhere. People all over the world are not just worried about their own and their children's future: they are deeply anxious about the future of this planet.
As we approach the third millennium, we must fashion a global concept of security that will embrace the notion of sustainable development, the need to combat underdevelopment, the unequal distribution of wealth, the degradation of our environment and the depletion of our resources. We are facing a new era which will have to be shaped by responses to common challenges which unite mankind, rather than the conflicts which have divided nations in the past. Nations can no longer attain security through competition and at each other's expense. They have to seek co-operation in order to enhance their common security.
We are witnessing amazing changes in East-West relations. Old tensions are abating. As stated by the United States Secretary of State, James Baker, only two days ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have moved from confrontation through dialogue to co-operation, and we all heard this in the statement by President Bush in the Assembly this morning.
We welcome the commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union to cut their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons by half. We are heartened by the progress made during the recent meeting in Wyoming. Success would serve as a recognition of the fact that nuclear weapons are not the solution to genuine security: their competitive accumulation leads to the insecurity of nations. This message is of fundamental importance to our efforts to stem the further spread of nuclear weapons.
We should urge the nuclear weapon States to further strengthen that message by concluding a comprehensive test-ban treaty. In the meantime, we welcome the progress made towards ratification of the threshold test-ban treaty and the treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions. A ban on chemical weapons is an urgent requirement. I therefore warmly welcome the new initiative presented by the United States President this mornings it is my sincere hope that this new step, and the understanding reached between the Soviet Union and the United States, will pave the way for a total ban on chemical weapons.
For the first time, the nations of East and West in Europe have sat down to deal with the dangers of their military confrontation, which have divided that continent for more than four decades. Again, it is the recognition of common interests which provides the engine. We now see the opportunity to reduce instabilities and to prevent military dispositions from blocking a promising process of peaceful change. Our task should be the construction of an open, equitable and co-operative political order where nations enjoy equal security at the lowest possible level of military force. We are intent on contributing actively to this all-important process of transformation, which is now fostering co-operation among all the nations which make up the security order in Europe.
By lowering and moving the military walls in Europe we are opening ourselves to a new era of co-operation. We must seek expanded economic relations on the basis of commercially sound principles and open economies. We must seek practical co-operation and common approaches to environmental protection. We must expand scientific and technological co-operation and broaden our cultural exchanges.
Countries in eastern and central Europe have embarked on a new course. They are engaging in a process of reform and democratisation in their internal policies as well as in their approach to the common challenges which confront us. We welcome - and we support - these efforts. We cannot guarantee their success. They must forge their own future. They must shape their own societies. Nevertheless, we shall convey in tangible and substantive ways our will for co-operation and indeed our solidarity with the peoples of eastern Europe, who have embarked on a new quest for freedom.
Political change reflects and creates new social energies and aspirations. The quest for human freedom defies oppression. Our commitment to the protection of the universal human rights recognizes no boundaries of State. It is a transnational commitment which transcends borders in Europe and in the world at large.
I welcome the declaration from the ninth non-aligned Summit in Belgrade, with its emphasis on human rights and the rights of women and their role in development. The declaration bears witness to the broadening support for these ideals. I strongly endorse what the Secretary-General observes in his report: '...it is becoming increasingly plain that no Government can expect immunity from international exposure to criticism if it flouts human rights in trying to overcome political dissidence or ethnic unrest.' (A/44/1, sect. VII) This year's General Assembly will consider the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Norway has taken an active part in the process, and we urge the Assembly to adopt the Convention. We have seen significant progress in the resolution of regional conflicts over the past year. My Government will present its view on these conflicts later during this General Assembly. One of the most hopeful changes has been the renewed trust in the United Nations, in viewing United Nations peace-keeping as an alternative to intervention.
Norway fully supports the Secretary-General's observations about the serious consequences of the financial shortfall affecting United Nations peace-keeping operations. Let me also stress the need for stronger political support for present operations. A special responsibility lies with the Security Council, which, in some cases, inter alia, in southern Lebanon, has failed to bring the weight of its authority to hear on those parties which defy the will of the international community and prevent the peace-keepers from fulfilling their mandate.
In Namibia, the foundation is being laid for a new independent State in Africa. Although the difficulties are manifold, we trust that the parties involved, with the assistance of the United Nations, will bring independence, and that process, forward on schedule. Norway, for its part, is ready to contribute its share to this historic development on the African continent.
The international community must rally to the task of combating the many challenges to our common security: the proliferation of nuclear and chemical arms, as well as their means of delivery; poverty; terrorism; and drug trafficking.
Let me call your particular attention to the serious international problem of drug abuse. There are no simple solutions: we need a broad strategy encompassing the control of supplies, the reduction of demand, the suppression of trafficking, and the prevention and treatment of addiction. Resources are needed at all levels: to assist producer countries in reducing the export of illicit drugs to the largest markets, to control the demand for drugs in the major 'consumer' countries, and to establish effective international co-operation, in the field of law enforcement also. Illicit drug trafficking is indeed an international problem. It solution requires global co-operation. We need to strengthen the United Nations by committing funds and vesting decision-making authority in United Nations institutions.
Since the publication of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development two and a half years ago, we have witnessed a surge in awareness concerning the environment. Several factors have contributed to this change. Reports of severe and lasting ecological degradation because of atmospheric, water or soil pollution are coming in from many regions of the world. Our scientists warn us that we may be facing a general global warming and significant changes in world climate.
The stratospheric ozone shield may be in danger. Scientific and technological developments are continuously opening new possibilities for modifying nature, for example through advances in biotechnology. At the same time, we are in the process of losing global biological and genetic diversity at an unprecedented rate, particularly through the rapid reduction of tropical rain forests.
If we look at the agenda of international conferences and negotiations on environmental questions for the next three years we find an impressive level of activities. At this session we have before us the consolidated report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. We are pleased to note that most of the United Nations organizations and many Governments are in the process of giving effect to the recommendations of the report. It is encouraging that the recent Western economic summit meeting, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and others, called for the integration of environmental concerns in day-to-day economic decision-making. Similarly, the non-aligned countries have called for urgent co-operative measures to ensure a sustainable and environmentally sound development.
A key principle in that process has been sustainability, a clear recognition and admission that economic development has, so far, not been sustainable. We need a green agenda. We need growth that respects the limitations set by nature. However, growth itself should not be limited. Poverty alleviation does not compete with sustainable development. Environmentally sound investments are necessary to sustain development. The industrialized countries carry a particular responsibility for securing growth in the world economy and opening markers to exports from developing countries. Developing countries have declared their readiness to undertake necessary policy reforms. I believe they should pursue and strengthen those efforts. However, to succeed we need the support of the international community.
Devastating debt burdens have for too long hampered growth and development in third world countries. It is now vital that the debt burdens be reduced to sustainable levels. We therefore fully support the view that debt reductions must occupy centre stage. The international community now recognizes the need to reduce the debt overhang. However, our strategy will succeed only if it is fully implemented. The readiness of commercial banks to play their part remains vital. We are concerned about reports that the banks are now failing to make new capital available for developing countries and thus to live up to their responsibilities under the Brady Plan.
We must agree on measures to restore development in the debt-ridden countries. Financial transfers to developing countries must be increased. The growth in aid volume has stagnated deplorably. The United Nations target of a 0.7 per cent ratio between official development assistance and gross national product is far from being met. Many countries both could and should do much better. I see no reason to conceal the fact that, while Norway has given around 1 per cent of its QJP in official development assistance to developing countries, we are disappointed that the OECD average has declined to a meagre 0.34 per cent.
But aid alone will not suffice. The importance of increased export earnings for the economies of developing countries cannot be overemphasized. Protectionist tendencies must be halted and reversed.
The question of energy is also in fact intimately linked both with economic growth and with environmental protection. We have lacked an energy dialogue in the past. We have felt the shock waves that sharply fluctuating oil prices have sent through the world economy. Norway sees the need to start a new dialogue on energy issues that will also address related environmental concerns.
Regional action is a central part of the processes of follow-up to the World Commission. African Ministers of Economic Planning, Education and Environment met at Kampala in June to set priorities for action to implement the recommendations of the report. In the Kampala Declaration they frankly state that economic development that is not sustainable should no longer be called development. We look forward to similar action from the conferences scheduled for Asia and the Pacific and for Latin America in 1990.

The industrialized countries account for the bulk of the world's accumulated pollution and resource depletion. Next May the countries of Europe and North America will meet at Bergen, Norway, for the regional follow-up meeting for 'Our Common Future' in the region of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE). We expect that conference to adopt a strong ministerial declaration that will reflect the commitment and political readiness of ECE Governments to set new national and regional targets for concrete action.
Next year the Second World Climate Conference will convene at Geneva. The spectre of global climate change is increasingly emerging as the most alarming environmental problem facing us. The abnormal variations in weather patterns we have witnessed during the 1980s and the human suffering and the enormous damage caused by floods, drought or hurricane in the course of the past few years have only underlined the need for action.
The Hague Declaration in March of this year called for new and wide-ranging principles for international co-operation to protect the atmosphere. Some 40 countries have now signed the Hague Declaration, and many others have indicated their support. The Declaration defines the need for new institutional authority, either by strengthening existing organizations or by creating a new institution, but within the framework of the United Nations. It calls for specific emission standards and targets, as well as for dispute settlement procedures binding on the parties. The establishment of new mechanisms to secure genuinely additional financial resources is a matter of priority. Such financial compensation would enable poor countries to adjust their economies more successfully to a sustainable development pattern. 
The Norwegian Government has proposed the establishment of an international climate fund with individual industrialized â country contributions in the order of 0.1 per cent of GNP.
The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under the leadership of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is of crucial importance in the elaboration of strategies for combating global warming. The Panel's report, which is due by September of next year, will form the main basis for the preparation of a global convention on climate. I urge full support of the work under way in the IPCC. We are encouraged that an increasing number of developing countries are now taking part in that process. There is no competition or conflict between the Hague initiative and the IPCC process. On the contrary, the Hague Declaration is intended to strengthen and supplement processes already under way internationally to protect the world climate.
The follow-up process of the report and the intensive research and negotiations now in progress concerning climate both point forward to the 1992 conference on environment and development. The forty-fourth session of the General Assembly will take important decisions on the preparatory process leading to the 1992 conference. We have noted the support of the Belgrade non-aligned summit for the candidacy of Brazil to host the conference. We feel confident that this would be a good choice, and we support it. It underlines the message that the conference should be addressing the vital linkage between environment and development.
Let me briefly outline my views on what we should aim for during our preparations for 1992.
First, the 1992 conference should he based on the concept of sustainable development. There is no way that we can solve the global environment problems now facing us without a direct linkage to a broader economic and social development process.
Secondly, and for those reasons, the preparatory process should address the need for additional financial resources. Cleaning up accumulated pollution and reversing present processes of ecological degradation are clearly going to be expensive. The alternative of doing nothing or too little, however, will be even more expensive. The developing countries will need increased assistance to help them avoid making the same mistakes that the industrialized world has made over and over again. I welcome the proposal made by Prime Minister Gandhi at the last non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade for the establishment of a planet protection fund. Several other financial mechanisms could also be explored, such as a system of consumer tax on non-renewable resources and users' fees on harmful emissions. We must he willing both nationally and internationally to apply such rules and principles.
Thirdly, we should set a timeframe for the negotiations on a global climate convention which would enable us to sign it during the 1992 conference, if at all possible.
Fourthly, we should make a new and committed effort to strengthen our institutions. Here, again, I attach particular importance to the creation of effective instruments which can deal with the challenges to the world climate. Perhaps that could be done through a strong monitoring mechanism for the forthcoming climate convention.
The 1980s have been characterized as a lost decade for development. This is true, even if there are notable exceptions. At the same time, we have experienced a crisis of multilateralism as nations have turned away from international institutions when concerted action has been most needed. The global vision has given way to fragmented outlooks and unilateral impulses.
But we have also seen economic globalisation on an unprecedented scale. The revolution in information, biotechnology and other technologies, the liberalization of capital markets, and the ensuing integration of trade and financial movements constitute but a few examples. Governments run the danger of losing control. National Governments are increasingly unable to cope with a situation of global interdependence, and our international institutions are still not given sufficient authority or resources to meet the new generation of problems. We face the reality of a global economy that is unbalanced, fragmented and interdependent at the same time.
We support the idea of convening a North-South summit under the aegis of the United Nations, with the aim of moving towards a more equitable and effective system of co-ordination and co-operation between industrialized and developing countries in linking economic and environmental tasks of global importance.
The time has come for a recommitment to multilateralism, to the search for global solutions. And we need to adopt new approaches. I believe we face an era in which the new threats to our security must be given the same high-level attention as the traditional issues concerning war and peace. Our founding fathers saw the need for a strong institution to deal with threats to international peace and security. I believe that certain elements of supranationality should now be considered at the global level. The challenges from the environment are a case in point. In regional co-operation, nations are gradually learning to accept majority decisions that on occasion may be viewed as contrary to narrowly defined national interests. The long-term view must come to prevail also in our global co-operation.
The international community is rediscovering the United Nations, how indispensable it is and how useful it can be, provided nations furnish it with the means to function as required. A global agenda for the management of change requires a strong United Nations.
 Collective management of global interdependence is no empty slogan. It is, very simply, the only acceptable formula for enlightened statecraft as we move into the last decade of this millennium.
","As we approach the third millennium, we must fashion a global concept of security that will embrace the notion of sustainable development, the need to combat underdevelopment, the unequal distribution of wealth, the degradation of our environment and the depletion of our resources. A special responsibility lies with the Security Council, which, in some cases, inter alia, in southern Lebanon, has failed to bring the weight of its authority to hear on those parties which defy the will of the international community and prevent the peace-keepers from fulfilling their mandate. Resources are needed at all levels: to assist producer countries in reducing the export of illicit drugs to the largest markets, to control the demand for drugs in the major 'consumer' countries, and to establish effective international co-operation, in the field of law enforcement also. The industrialized countries carry a particular responsibility for securing growth in the world economy and opening markers to exports from developing countries. The follow-up process of the report and the intensive research and negotiations now in progress concerning climate both point forward to the 1992 conference on environment and development."
44,1989,LAO,"ï»¿
Allow me first on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to congratulate you, Sir, most warmly on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. My delegation is convinced that under your skilful guidance the work of this session will be crowned with success.
I should also like to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, our feelings of renewed confidence in the tireless efforts he has made to promote and strengthen peace and co-operation among nations. 
The general international situation has seen a certain easing of tension following the resumption of the dialogue between the two main Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States of America, which made possible the signature and entry into force of the Treaty between tine United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. With this very welcome step the world now awaits the conclusion of other agreements on disarmament, particularly one relating to the reduction by 50 per cent of strategic offensive weapons as mentioned encouragingly by the delegations of the Soviet Union and the United States in their statements last week. The deadly capacity of conventional aid chemical weapons also requires full attention from us all. There are grounds for hoping that an agreement will be concluded as soon as possible.
While the general international situation has seen positive changes, nevertheless it remains complex aid full of contradictions. We still see the stockpiling and modernization of weapons, continuing nuclear tests and also research into the militarization of space. Certain Western circles do not seem to be willing to give up their ideas of aggression, interference, the use of force and confrontation, which date back to the dark years of the cold war. Thus the concept of nuclear deterrence reaffirmed by certain great Powers at a time when all our energies are being channelled into building a non-violent world free of nuclear weapons is a threat to the interests and security of all peoples and nations of the world. It should be noted, moreover, that in certain regions conflicts that have lasted for decades have not only not been resolved satisfactorily but are becoming ever more convoluted and tragic military bases are not being dismantled and continue to threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.
In the Persian Gulf area, the political wisdom guiding the leaders of Iran and Iraq has enabled those two fraternal countries to conclude a cease-fire, thus putting an end to a destructive and agonizing war which tore them apart for nearly eight years. We are convinced that the various efforts being made to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987), efforts broadly encouraged aid supported by the international community, are sure to achieve the hoped-for result, namely, a final, just and lasting solution to the conflict.
The situation in Afghanistan continues to concern us greatly despite the successful conclusion of the Geneva Agreements in April 1988 aid the total withdrawal from that country of Soviet troops. While to date the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have properly applied aid implemented these Agreements both in spirit and in letter, it is to be regretted that the other signatory countries have not suitably honoured their commitments ad have chosen to torpedo them deliberately, which means that Afghanistan at this time is in the grip of a murderous, fratricidal war which sows devastation and grief among the innocent civilian population, the consequences of which will reverberate well beyond the borders of that coin try.
The climate of understanding which developed last year in the Maghreb also encouraged the hope that the problem of Western Sahara would see a happy, acceptable solution through constructive and steady dialogue guaranteeing the courageous Sahraoui people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.
As for the situation in southern Africa, we are pleased with the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia under the leadership of the courageous South west Africa People's Organization (SWAEO). However, it is deplorable that given this positive development the Pretoria regime still continues to practise the inhuman and criminal policy of apartheid against the black African population and the front-line States.
In Latin America and the Caribbean we appreciate to the full the efforts of the Contador a Group and its Support Group and their contribution to peace. The Guatemala Agreement of 7 August 1987 and the Tela Declaration of 7 August 1989 which followed testify to the will of the peoples of this region to reach a peaceful settlement of their conflicts without external interference. Any attempt to supply assistance to the contras in Nicaragua aid to carry out policies of coercion and blockade against other countries by any foreign Power will merely seriously compromise the peace efforts.  
In the Indian Ocean region, the existence of military bases of foreign Peers equipped with nuclear weapons is a constant threat to the independence and security of littoral ad hinterland states. The convening of the International Conference on the Indian Ocean, in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly of the United nations, thus remains necessary, indeed essential in order to guarantee Peace and to promote cooperation among peoples.
The Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes supports the initiative taken by the coastal countries of the Mediterranean to transform that region into a zone of peace, security end cooperation free of  y foreign military presence.  AS regards the situation in Cyprus, the Government and people of Laos commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations whose mission of good offices has made it possible for the people of the two Cypriot co-unities to begin the process of direct negotiations in order to achieve a just and lasting solution to the problem dividing them.
In the Middle East, the situation remains disturbing, owing to the intensification of the occupying Power's implementation of a repressive policy against Palestinian Arabs in the occupied territories. The popular uprising - the intifadah - which, is the expression of the determination end courage of the oppressed Palestinian people, certainly enjoys the sympathy and firm support of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. We also support my initiative aimed at the urgent convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the Participation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on an equal footing with the other parties directly concerned.
In the Korean peninsula, the artificial division imposed from outside and the presence of foreign armed forces in its southern part are the major obstacles to
the peaceful ramification of Korea. Any attempt to admit either part of Korea to the United Nations will merely complicate the situation.
se situation in South-East Asia has currently become the main focus of international public opinion. It will be recalled that each year during the debate on the question of Kampuchea in the Assembly, some claim that the withdraw of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia is a sine qua non for the settlement of this question. Now, that withdrawal has been fully effected. It was concluded less than a week ago in the presence of many international delegations and with  the world's mass media. It was carried out in accordance with the timetable established by the State of Cambodia. But the situation in that country remains unclear, owing to the attempts by some to help Cambodian factions and by other: to return the genocidal Pol Pot regime to power through so-called power-sharing. Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge have already resumed their recidivist action in the field against innocent civilians, thus terrorizing all foreign nationals, including Laos, in that country. At the military level, convinced that the Vietnamese retreat will weaken the State of Cambodia, the armed elements of the democratic coalition have not hesitated to begin encroaching on the of the latter, particularly in the region of Pailin, near the Khmer-Thai:	Given ail that, it is a mistake, not to say an illusion, on the part of partisans of those who believe that, after the Vietnamese withdrawal from rebel forces will be able to seize some of the land in order to negotiate from a position of force. The case is the same in Afghanistan.
Given such a situation, can we, as supporters of peace and stability, remain indifferent? The Jakarta Informal Meetings were of the view that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is linked to the non-return of the genocidal Pol Pot clique to power and to the halting of foreign assistance to Cambodian parties, in order to
avert civil war and to promote national reconciliation. The international Paris Conference that accompanied those meetings led to new positive elements. At this stage of development, we still need to find the meat reasonable means for translating those well-known formulas into actions, to prevent the resumption of armed hostilities, and to avoid actions that might alienate the efforts of countries in the region and those of the co-chairmen of the Paris Conference, who have striven tirelessly to unite the Cambodian parties round a table. My delegation appeals for a turn to the better and for a display of realism.
As for the situation in my country, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, we have seen new, positive developments following the adoption a few years ago of a policy of openness consisting of promoting and encouraging foreign investment through the subsequent restructuring of various administrative and juridical branches able to respond to that new need. This policy, it is generally felt, has contributed actively to improving the climate of relations among countries in the region. It is also comforting to stress here that relations between my country and Thailand are steadily improving, although the border dispute has not yet been settled definitively.
The international political climate has certainly improved over the last few years. However, contrary to expectations and hopes, the world economy continues to go through a serious crisis in its development. Ear from resolving itself, the present structural crisis in tine world economy offers an uncertain future. In fact, the crushing burden of debt continues to oppress the third world. Commodity prices continue to plunge, terms of trade have deteriorated, aid discriminatory practices against the exports of developing countries have further increased. In that truly disastrous external environment, developing countries have undertaken
large-scale reforms and have agreed to broad adjustment measures, which have in certain cases entailed extremely high social and political costs. Those countries deserve the full support aid sympathy of the international community. It is true that a certain degree of recovery has been noted in certain Western developed countries, but that has had scant influence on the effort to improve the health of the world economy.
In the light of today's reality, when the interdependence of States is more obvious than ever before, international economic problems can be solved only if we co-ordinate our actions and if we all, developed and developing countries, act together. For in the new age no country or group of countries can by itself develop and protect itself from the repercussions of world social, economic and ecological problems. In that spirit we support a united and multilateral approach to seeking lasting and effective solutions to present-day problems. If that goal is to be attained, there is a pressing need for serious and constructive dialogue between North and South to begin, and from that viewpoint everything should be done to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly, planned for April 1990, devoted to international economic co-operation, and particularly to the resumption of the developing countries growth and economic development.
At a time when the world economy is facing an unprecedented crisis, certain industrial countries are continuing to adopt coercive measures against third-world countries, in violation of ethical principles and of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The international community must do all it can to put an immediate end to such unfair practices.
The drug problem, one of the greatest, scourges of the century, continues to be a source of world concern. The Lao Government fully shares that concern and has taken various measures designed, on the one hand, to bring a gradual halt to the traditional cultivation of poppy by those who engage in such cultivation and, on the other hand, to replace it by a substitute crop. We have developed projects for co-operation in this sphere with such international organizations as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNEDAC), as well as with various interested countries. We plan to expand that co-operation, which should be based on strict respect for the independence and
sovereignty of each State. It is true that in the struggle against drug abuse the non-production of narcotics is of great importance. However, the effective response to the problem is reduction and elimination of demand. The most powerful drug cartels in the world will ultimately founder if all of our children learn just to say 'No' to drugs.
In conclusion, my delegation wishes to assure the President that he will have our full co-operation and that we shall work in a constructive spirit with other delegations to contribute to the success of this session of the General Assembly.
","With this very welcome step the world now awaits the conclusion of other agreements on disarmament, particularly one relating to the reduction by 50 per cent of strategic offensive weapons as mentioned encouragingly by the delegations of the Soviet Union and the United States in their statements last week. While to date the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have properly applied aid implemented these Agreements both in spirit and in letter, it is to be regretted that the other signatory countries have not suitably honoured their commitments ad have chosen to torpedo them deliberately, which means that Afghanistan at this time is in the grip of a murderous, fratricidal war which sows devastation and grief among the innocent civilian population, the consequences of which will reverberate well beyond the borders of that coin try. The climate of understanding which developed last year in the Maghreb also encouraged the hope that the problem of Western Sahara would see a happy, acceptable solution through constructive and steady dialogue guaranteeing the courageous Sahraoui people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. As for the situation in my country, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, we have seen new, positive developments following the adoption a few years ago of a policy of openness consisting of promoting and encouraging foreign investment through the subsequent restructuring of various administrative and juridical branches able to respond to that new need. In that truly disastrous external environment, developing countries have undertaken
large-scale reforms and have agreed to broad adjustment measures, which have in certain cases entailed extremely high social and political costs."
44,1989,ISL,"ï»¿I join previous speakers in congratulating our President on his election to preside over the current session of the General Assembly. It testifies to the high esteem in which he is held by the General Assembly and is also an indication of the respect felt for the great country, Nigeria, of which he is a worthy representative.
As inhabitants of an island separated from its neighbours by a vast ocean, Icelanders may have had a keener appreciation than the peoples of most nations of the extent to which distance has come to count less and less as a factor in world affairs. The forging of ever-closer links within the world community has been apparent at many levels - technological, economic and environmental. As a consequence, there is new a growing awareness among the various peoples of the world of a universality of interest and of a common destiny of humankind. Some time ago somebody coined the phrase, 'global village', to describe that trend. Someone from a seafaring nation would perhaps put it differently, we are all in the same boat.
The globalisation of issues that used to be the prerogative of individual States has not simply been a matter of historical inevitability. Deliberate political action has also had a role to play. The far-reaching changes that are under way in East-West relations, as evidenced most recently in bilateral talks between the United States aid the Soviet Union, have shown us how effective political leadership can truly make a difference.
We are entering a new era in international relations, which, seems to offer realistic prospects for a fundamental transformation of the political, ideological aid military confrontation which has so characterized One post-war era. The successful management of the present transition period will require the political will arid imagination to map out new avenues in international relations, paying due regard to the risks and uncertainties involved.
Efforts to overcome suspicion aid lack of trust in relations between East aid West have helped establish an environment in which it might now prove possible to channel resources from costly military competition to more creative international endeavours. The easing of tensions between East and West will thus no doubt redound to the benefit of North-South relations also.
I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his valuable contribution to solving serious international and regional conflicts, thereby strengthening the role and image of the united Nations.
Strengthening the united Nations implies reinforcement of the rule of law in international relations. The growing awareness of the world community of the rule of law in international affairs is particularly welcome to an unarmed nation, which fought its battle for independence without resort to violence.
The changing world environment is opening up unprecedented opportunities for the united Nations. With the cold war mentality on the wane, the world
Organization can now for the first time entertain realistic hopes of translating into reality the vision contained in the United Nations Charter. At the same time* the Organization itself has emerged as a more effective agent of change.
We who are alive now can be seen as merely temporary guests on this planet, Earth. While we are here we are under an obligation to preserve the common heritage of our forebears and to secure the living conditions of our descendants, the generations that come after us.
Iceland is a country which is overwhelmingly dependent for its existence upon the exploitation of the resources of the seas. For Icelanders the safeguarding of the environment is a matter of life or death, no less.
We are grateful for the initiatives which are apparent on the international front in so many spheres*, on the protection of the ozone layer, on long-range transboundary pollution and, most recently, on the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. Two years ago we welcomed in this body the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, chaired by my Nordic friend Gro Harlem Brmdtlaid, the Prime Minister of Norway. The report analysed the state of the environment and made recommendations for future action. This year we started the preparatory work for a United Nations conference on environment end development, to be held in 1992.
These initiatives respond to a need which is becoming ever more apparent to the world community. In the industrialized world we are looking into the murky backyard of the civilization we have created - be it on land, at sea or in the atmosphere. To all of us, and particularly with reference to the developing world, it is becoming apparent that without reducing poverty, and at the same time protecting the environment, economic growth will be denied us in the future.
We are seeing the effects of global warming, the greenhouse effect, destruction of tropical rain forests, deforestation, acid rain, desertification and depletion of the ozone layer.
The inhabitants of the earth's continents need to be reminded that the oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the earth's surface. They are and will remain in the future a basic source of life on earth. For my people, the Icelandic nation, preservation of the natural resources of the seas will, therefore, remain paramount. As we say in Icelandic: 'Fcourland vort halft er hafio' - or, the sea is half of our fatherland.
The living resources of the sea can be considered as the world's food reserves. The increasing pollution of the seas, not least that caused by radiation and by the industrialized nations' practice of using the open seas as a dumping ground for their industrial wastes, is therefore a major cause for alarm, not only for coastal States but for the whole world community.
We can view these developments against the threat of the even greater, indeed catastrophic, damage which could be caused by the weapons of mass destruction. We need only recall the devastation which resulted from the use of these weapons at the close of the Second World War.
In its greed and short-sightedness the ruling species of this earth, which has given itself the honourable title of 'homo sapiens', seems not only to be prepared to disregard the consequences of its behaviour on its own habitat, but to be actually engaged in total warfare against nature - even ready to destroy it completely.
I was struck by the sombre assessment in the Brundtland report which refers to the 6 million hectares of productive dry land which is turned into worthless desert each year, and the destruction of more than 11 million hectares of forests annually. Over three decades this destruction would extend to land masses the size of, respectively, Saudi Arabia and India. The report warns us of the environmental trends which threaten radically to alter the planet and endanger many species upon it, including the human race. Are we helpless in the face of these assaults on our globe? I say 'no' - end the initiatives I referred to earlier can be seen to have their basis in a recognition of the legal obligation to work together to protect our planet. These obligations can be traced to the principles of the united Nations Charter which govern our work in this body. The general principles of the Charter entail firm commitments for mankind and for Governments not to pollute our planet, nor ruthlessly to exploit our natural resources. The Charter establishes a duty of a moral and ethical character. Our past, present and future activities constitute an integral ecological whole. The Bible reminds us that as we sow, so shall we reap.
The General Assembly has adopted resolutions setting out some of the relevant principles; one of these is the 1982 resolution adopting the World Charter for Nature. We have seen endorsed in this body the principles of the Stockholm Declaration adopted at the close of the 1972 united Nations Conference on the Human Environment. I also note article 55 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Convention of 1949.
In 1982 the world community adopted the united Nations Convention on the law of the Sea, which contains, in its part XII, important principles on the protection of the marine environment. The Brundtland Commission concluded that
'the most significant initial action that nations can take in the interests of the oceans' threatened life-support system is to ratify the law of the Sea Convention'. (A/42/427, annex, Chapter 10, para. 55)
The World Charter for Nature includes among its 24 principles the obligation to respect nature and not to compromise the genetic viability of earth. Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides that care be taken in warfare to protect the natural environment against widespread, long-term and irreparable damage. A group of legal experts reporting to the Brisndtland Commission set out a
series of legal principles asserting, for example, the fundamental right of all human beings to an environment adequate for their health and well-being.
But it is in the Law of the Sea Convention that we can seek inspiration for our further efforts in the field of environmental protection. It is a matter of pride foe my nation and for many of the peoples of the developing world that we were ahead of our time when we started our long-drawn-out struggle for this constitution of the marine environment. In the Convention we can find the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment through co-operation between States on a global and regional basis. We find the limitations on dumping and pollution of the atmosphere particularly relevant in this context.
The Government of Iceland is of the view that existing legal instruments for the protection of the environment should be strengthened. There exist various legal instruments that apply to specific fields of protection of the environment. But new instruments are needed, for example with regard to climatic change. New fields should be explored. We welcome, for instance, the initiative of Malta proposing the inclusion of a new item in the Assembly's agenda, on environmental protection of extraterritorial space.
We are, however, also of the view that we can take further steps by drawing from the experience in drafting the law of the Sea Convention. A new concise legal instrument should be prepared, setting out the principles with regard to the rights and obligations of States generally applicable to all fields of protection of the environment. These principles would relate to the right of all human beings to a safe environment and the obligations to conserve natural resources and maintain biological diversity and to provide for utilization of natural resources on the basis of tine principle of optimum sustainable yield. They would call for standard-setting, for environmental assessment and for obligatory co-operation between States in the protection of the environment. It would be appropriate for the General Assembly itself to signify its commitment to this field by taking the steps necessary for the preparation of such a new legal instrument, either under its own auspices or in connection with the preparatory work for the 1992 conference on environment and development.
The well-known Norwegian expert in international law Jens Evensen - a judge at the International Court of Justice - has reminded us that 'good planets are hard to find'. Let us realize and accept in all humility that we have to live in peace, not only among ourselves but also with mother Earth.
The changes towards more economic and political freedom in Central aid Eastern Europe are both more rapid and more radical than could have been expected previously. As evidenced by developments, particularly in Poland and Hungary, countries in Central and Eastern Europe now seem to have a realistic prospect of being able to abandon a political and economic system, forced upon them in the wake of the Second World War, that was alien to their culture and heritage and, as history has proved, utterly detrimental to their economic progress.
These developments are a major factor in establishing a basis for improvements in East-West relations. But it must be recognized that internal change in Eastern Europe does not take place in isolation? the irreversibility of internal change may to a substantial degree depend upon external responses.
Present developments in Central and Eastern Europe need, therefore, to be encouraged. They should be looked upon as an unprecedented opportunity to transform East-West relations, to build a new foundation for a lasting peace in Europe that gives more weight to political than to military arrangements.
As the use of force in East-West relations has become more remote than at any other time since the Second World War, arms control aid disarmament have moved to the centre stage of attention. Arms control, however, should not be regarded as a substitute for genuine progress across the whole range of issues an the East-West agenda, which includes, certainly, the human dimension. The balanced results of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security aid Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which ended in January, have helped to place the security-related aspects of that agenda in a proper context.
Yet there can be no question but that progress on arms control has a positive impact far beyond the area of security proper. The early conclusion of the current CSCE-sponsored Vienna negotiations on conventional forces in Europe, on the one hand, and confidence and security-building measures, on the other, holds particular promise. An agreement to eliminate current imbalances in conventional weaponry would remove one of the underlying causes of East-West tension and facilitate the transformation of political relations in Europe.
Prospects for substantial and meaningful disarmament have also been boosted significantly by the declared willingness of the United States and the Soviet Union to cease production, and do away with their stockpiles, of chemical weapons. We welcome, in this context, the proposals made by President Bush to this Assembly only a week ago and the positive Soviet response.
The reduction of the massive arsenals of nuclear weapons is no less a test case for improvements in East-West relations than are negotiations on conventional weaponry and confidence-building in Europe. If the past provides us with any guidance, an era of co-operation is not likely to be realized if the competition in nuclear weapons cannot be managed.
The Treaty to eliminate intermediate nuclear forces on land has dramatically demonstrated how substantial cuts in nuclear weapons can serve the purpose of enhancing security. It is in this spirit that we welcome recent success in the removal of obstacles to a strategic arms-reduction treaty. The progress made towards the ratification of the Threshold Test-Ban Treaty and towards a treaty ran peaceful nuclear explosions is a necessary step towards the goal of a comprehensive test ban.
The Icelandic Government has expressed its view that; once the current negotiations in Europe have yielded satisfactory results, confidence-building and arms control should be extended to the seas. The seas have not received much attention in disarmament negotiations so far, although several treaties apply to the maritime domain. The arms race at sea clearly deserves more attention in order that a safer and more secure ocean environment may be created.
We therefore welcome the growing recognition that improved stability, predictability end confidence are called for at sea no less than on laid. There is also a growing understanding that confidence-building at sea must be compatible with the principle of freedom of navigation aid must take into account the asymmetrical dependence of different States upon the seas and secure ocean lines of communication.
The strategic arms talks offer the prospect of a substantial reduction in strategic nuclear weapons, including those at sea. In our view, the large number of non-strategic naval nuclear weapons should be taken into consideration as a subject in a confidence-building and disarmament process that includes sea areas.
Security and the environment are becoming increasingly interrelated. The contamination of the ocean environment must be taken seriously by nations that depend on the living resources of the seas. Repeated Soviet nuclear-submarine accidents remind us of the potentially disastrous consequences of such accidents, particularly if they were to occur in important fishing waters such as those around my country. As an initial step, we therefore suggest that international guidelines for the safety of sea borne reactors should be worked out by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These guidelines should apply to all vessels.
I have argued that the problems of the environment are emerging as the dominant issue facing this Organization in the decades ahead. But, even as we take on new tasks and responsibilities, there will remain a need for the good offices of the united Nations in bringing regional conflicts to a peaceful solution.
The situation in the Middle East and a peaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict - continues to be of primary concern to the international community. A comprehensive, just aid lasting solution will be found only if the parties concerned refrain from acts of violence and thus show their sincere will to attain the goal of a lasting peace.
Israel's plan to hold elections in the occupied territories is an important step in the process of seeking a solution to the conflict. In particular, we welcome and support the 10-point plan recently presented to this Assembly by President Mubarak of Egypt for the implementation of such elections. Egypt has ignited hope for a dialogue that might lift the Israeli-Palestinian conflict off the streets aid onto the negotiating table.
We welcome the constructive efforts of the Arab League to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon. A lasting solution guaranteeing that country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity must include the withdrawal of all foreign troops. The taking of hostages end abductions constitute intolerable violations of international humanitarian law.
One of the most important achievements of the United Nations is the extensive codification and progressive development of human rights. The United Nations has successfully increased the number and scope of international agreements. Its latest achievement in this field is the drafting of a convention on the rights of the child, to be considered at this session of the General Assembly.
In spite of this active role of the United Nations, the frequency and magnitude of human-rights violations are deplorable. It is obvious that setting standards is not enough; we must, through international action, make Governments and individuals abide by these standards, and we must increase pressure on all those who violate human rights. One of the means to that end is to strengthen the implementation measures aid enforcement capabilities of the united Nations Another key element is knowledge. Every individual on Earth must be informed of his fundamental human rights. We must always bear in mind that it follows from the Charter of the United Nations that a State cannot claim that the promotion and protection of human rights constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of a State.
I referred earlier to the increasing awareness of the world community of the role of the rule of law in the affairs of nations. In this connection the Government of Iceland welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the item on a united Nations decade of international law, following the Hague Declaration of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We note the incorporation in that Declaration of references to many of the principles of the rule of law which, as I have indicated today, should govern relations between States.
More than 1,000 years ago the Icelandic Althing - the oldest parliamentary assembly in the world - adopted the principle of the rule of law to guide the relations between the various interests in the newly established republic. This principle - Legibus gentes sunt moderandae - was inscribed on the gavel used for many years in this noble Assembly. We are reassured that in the era of co-operation that we are now entering, the world community will let its actions be guided by this universal principle of the rule of law.
","As inhabitants of an island separated from its neighbours by a vast ocean, Icelanders may have had a keener appreciation than the peoples of most nations of the extent to which distance has come to count less and less as a factor in world affairs. The increasing pollution of the seas, not least that caused by radiation and by the industrialized nations' practice of using the open seas as a dumping ground for their industrial wastes, is therefore a major cause for alarm, not only for coastal States but for the whole world community.

It gives me pleasure at the very outset to convey to Major-General Garba my sincere congratulations on his election to the prestigious position of President of this world body at its forty-fourth session. His election is a tribute both to his country, Nigeria, which has demonstrated its unflinching loyalty to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, and to his own vast ability, skill and experience.
Let me also pay a tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, for his outstanding record at the helm of the General Assembly at its forty-third session.
I should like also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his relentless efforts to enhance the role of the Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security and the solution of global problems. We urge that his role in finding peaceful, comprehensive solutions to regional problems receive full support from the Security Council and the General Assembly. Today's world, fortunately, is marked by a general relaxation of tension in international relations and improved prospects for finding peaceful and lasting solutions to global and regional problems. New vistas of co-operation or. the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels have been opened, facilitating the solution of common-security, political, economic and environmental problems that have plagued our world. Mutual relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are improving, and confrontation between the two has eased considerably. Progress has been made also in negotiations on the reduction or elimination of various types of nuclear, chemical and conventional weapons, while the destruction of at least one category of nuclear weapons is already under way.
The need for speedy solution of regional problems has been universally acknowledged, although the process of achieving this has been painfully slow. Peoples in various parts of the world, including our own region, are still the victims of senseless wars and destruction because old policies based on confrontation have not been abandoned in the interest of regional peace and harmony.
In the Middle East, we condemn the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab lands, including Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights, and Israel's iron-fist policy against the heroic Palestinian intifadah. The convening of an international conference with the full participation of all parties concerned, including the State of Palestine, on an equal footing, remains the only possible avenue for resolving the Middle East conflict.
The Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the cessation of war and the commencement of talks between Iran and Iraq. We sincerely hope they will find an honourable and lasting solution to all their differences in the near future. 
In Cyprus, we welcome meetings between the President and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, and we support a peaceful solution achieved through dialogue and based on the independence, territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Cyprus.
We welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea and demand that an end be put to all forms of interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea. All efforts should be made to restore peace in the country and to let Kampucheans themselves solve their internal difficulties.
We also support the Korean people's quest for peaceful reunification and national unity through dialogue and reconciliation.
In southern Africa, the continuation of the abhorrent policy of apartheid is the source of great human suffering, destabilization and conflict. We demand the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and believe the Secretary-General and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group should be rendered full support so they may supervise a free, democratic and unhindered election and the achievement of full independence for Namibia. We welcome the high-level meeting between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front, and support the efforts of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity towards the holding of a fair referendum without administrative or military constraints.
We support the accord reached among five Central American countries on putting an end to war and destruction in Nicaragua and hope for its unhindered implementation.
It is also our hope that the question of the Malvinas may be promptly resolved on the basis of General Assembly resolutions, eliminating the differences between Argentina and the United Kingdom.
The disparities in economic development between developed and developing countries is deepening constantly, while the economic and social situation in most developing countries continues to deteriorate further. The plight of the least developed countries has reached a particularly distressing level because the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries has not been implemented. Growth and development in developing countries continue to be mostly stagnant or to register negative rates. Commodity prices remain low and terms of trade are worsening, and protectionist measures on the part of developed countries have been on the increase. The problem of debt and debt servicing has become unbearable for developing countries, resulting in a net flow of financial resources from developing to developed countries. We welcome the convening in April 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly and hope the fourth United Nations Development Decade will reverse the adverse trends experienced during the Third Decade.
It is also our earnest hope that the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, scheduled for 1990 in Paris, will adopt adequate measures for implementing General Assembly resolutions on acceleration of the development process in the least developed countries in the 1990s. Despite our sincere wishes and concerted efforts, and contrary to the general trend of improvement in the international climate, the situation in our region remains far from satisfactory. If anything, it has deteriorated further. Aggression against Afghanistan and interference and intervention in its internal affairs have acquired new dimensions. The complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and our sincere compliance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements notwithstanding, these Agreements have been sabotaged by Pakistan. Prom 15 February to the end of August 1989, 18 different types of weapons have been put in the hands of extremist groups trained in Pakistan to continue the blood-bath in Afghanistan. These weapons include 250 ground-to-ground rocket launchers, 110 pieces of field artillery and mortars, 120 recoilless artillery, 550 air-defence missile complexes, 2,950 heavy machine-guns, 4,500 manual rocket launchers and 200,000 different types of ground-to-ground rockets.
The number of military training centres for the extremists in Pakistan has now reached 180, marking an increase after the entry into force of the Geneva Agreements. Each week between 30 and 35 armed groups, comprising 1,200 to 1,500 people trained in these centres, are infiltrated into Afghanistan to bring death and destruction. Units from Pakistan's 11th Division are directly participating in the fighting inside Afghanistan. So do mercenary Wahabis from Saudi Arabia, which is also putting generous financial assistance in the hands of the extremists. Similarly, from 15 February to the end of August 1989, a total of 413,102 rockets and heavy artillery shells have rained down on the inhabitants of the cities of Afghanistan. What has been the result? Thousands of civilians killed and thousands more injured. In Kabul alone, 1,383 rockets have claimed the lives of 671 people and injured another 1,014. Recently even the aeroplane used by the representative of the Secretary-General was not spared such rocket attacks. As recently as 22 and 23 September, a total of 40 rockets were fired on Kabul - on the
ewe of the General Assembly - killing 41 people and injuring 59. One of the rockets hit a crowded market-place. This is blind terrorism perpetuated by the interventionist policy of one of the signatories to the Geneva Agreements.
The resort to rocket attacks on cities and the blind and indiscriminate terrorist attacks against civilians testify not to the strength of the extremists but to their weakness. It is the result of crushing defeats of these groups in Jalalabad, Khost, Kandahar and elsewhere in Afghanistan. The heroic armed forces of Afghanistan defending the independence, territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the country, as is their patriotic duty, have dealt these hirelings of the aliens so crushing a blow that they do not dare any more, even with the direct assistance and participation of the Pakistani army, to face the defenders of Afghanistan. The result has been desperate rocket attacks on cities and the indiscriminate murder of innocent men, women and children. These attacks cannot, however, compensate for the moral, political and military bankruptcy of the extremist groups, nor can they revive in the rank and file of the opposition the lost hope of a military victory. Many commanders inside the country have by now realized the need for ending this fratricidal war and restoring peace through national reconciliation.
What Pakistan is continuing against Afghanistan is State terrorism, which has been condemned by the Assembly as well as by the Non-Aligned Movement in a resolution adopted at the Belgrade summit meeting.
If internal problems in a neighbouring country should be taken to constitute a basis for policy towards that neighbour, who can predict what could happen to Pakistan and what its future would be? The Punjabis, Sindis, Pashtoons and Baluchis are all tired of the increasing domination of the Pakistani military. However, these are Pakistani problems and we, as neighbours, do not arrogate to ourselves the right to get involved in them. Nor do we believe in creating Governments for others outside their country.

The hope for military victory which was crushed at Jalalabad has been further lest during what was termed the sunnier fighting season. No new deadline of 12 or 18 months will accomplish through military means what was supposed to happen weeks or even days after 15 February of this year but did not.
But the question is; How many more Afghans have to go down the drain of a senseless fratricidal war for the planners and executors of the war to realize the futility of the military option? How much more must Afghanistan, a least developed country, be destroyed before a military solution is abandoned in favour of a political solution?
The time to bring peace to Afghanistan is now. Every day that passes claims the lives of more of its people and brings more havoc to its economy. The grounds for peace, for reconciliation, for the establishment of a broad-based government exist in Afghanistan. What is required is the abandonment of old policies, of intransigent positions and of disregard for reality.
The path to arrive at peace in Afghanistan is clear. Full and faithful implementation of the Geneva Agreements by the parties and guarantors and the implementation of consensus resolutions of the General Assembly are the most important and basic steps in that direction. Putting an immediate end to interference and intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, as clearly stipulated by the Agreements, can and must play a cardinal role in realizing peace. Pakistan's sincere co-operation with the United Nations good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNQ3MAP) can turn it from its present ineffectiveness into one that fully supervises the implementation of all the provisions of the Geneva Agreements. So far, the Government of Afghanistan has brought to the notice of UNGOMAP 6,492 cases of flagrant violations of the Geneva Agreements through 827 notes delivered to its headquarters in Kabul. These cases cover violations of every single provision of the Geneva document on non-interference and non-intervention, such as, among other things, the dismantling of bases, refraining from the dispatch of armed groups and the transfer of arms and not committing acts that would undermine the stability of the other high contracting party. None of these violations has been investigated exactly as stipulated in the Geneva Agreements, owing to Pakistan's complete disregard for the accords. The continuation of war, destruction, great human suffering and loss of life in my country is a telling testimony to the complete neglect of all the provisions of the Geneva Agreements by Pakistan. When the flames of war, aggression and intervention are still increasingly swallowing up lives and properties of the people of Afghanistan, any claim that the Geneva Agreements' provisions on non-interference and non-intervention are being implemented can obviously not be taken seriously.
The people of Afghanistan and the international community are beginning to question the sincerity and good will of Pakistan in signing the Geneva agreements, as well as the actual observance and supervision of their implementation. The statement made at the opening of the general debate by the President of the United States of America, Mr. George Bush, and his words on the need to work together in the framework of the United Nations to bring peace to those who have fallen victim to regional conflicts are encouraging. A positive change in United States policy, from putting the means of war and destruction in the hands of extremists to assisting and contributing to the peace process in Afghanistan, would play a significant role in putting those words into effect.
War cannot accomplish any policy goals and the so-called interim government, illegally established by Islamabad, cannot gain even a grain of legitimacy. The situation has already disintegrated into infighting and armed clashes inside Afghanistan. The policy of supplying them with huge quantities of advanced weapons cannot serve the United States interest in the region, while in the long run the continuation of war, destruction and human suffering in Afghanistan will further damage its standing among the Afghan people. Peaceful ways of arriving at policy objectives are certainly there and must be sought.
The situation in Afghanistan has changed since 15 February 1989. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has abandoned the monopoly on power. Therefore, the continuation of previous policies by the United States Administration is not realistic. This has been reflected in the United States mass media and also in the United States Congress. We are ready to welcome in Kabul a special envoy of the United States Administration for a fact-finding mission and an exchange of views. We believe that such a trip would allow the United States to get first-hand knowledge of the present reality in Afghan society and of our goodwill in regard to restoring peace and for a democratic system based on political pluralism and a free economy.
As is the case in most other parts of the world, in our region too the traffic in arms and narcotics go hand in hand. The involvement of Afghan extremist groups in the production and smuggling of drugs during the past 10 years has brought about a very dangerous situation. The Republic of Afghanistan stands ready fully to co-operate in eradicating this serious problem.
We welcome the positive and realistic trends in the policy of our neighbour to the west, the Islamic Republic of Iran. From the great country of China, another neighbour of Afghanistan, we expect a more positive contribution to the restoration of peace in our country. We, on our part, are ready to have normal, friendly relations with all the countries of the world, particularly our neighbours.
The question of the safe, voluntary and honourable return of Afghan refugees requires urgent attention. Those who perpetuate the war in Afghanistan must not cite the continuation of the war as a pretext for their policy of hindering the return of the refugees. While we express our gratitude to all these countries, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other organizations and agencies for having provided for our Afghan brothers while they were refugees, we believe the time has come for such assistance to be geared towards their repatriation to their homeland and reintegration in the life of their country. We urge Pakistan to co-operate in the establishment of mixed commissions. The establishment of these commissions, which according to the Geneva Agreements should have occurred immediately after the entry into force of the Agreements 16 months ago, is long overdue.
The reconstruction of Afghanistan requires urgent international, governmental and nonâ1governmental assistance. Unfortunately, 3wever, a number of countries have refrained from putting at the disposal of the United Nations Coordinator for Economic and Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan the assistance they have already pledged. Assistance to the people of Afghanistan should not fall victim to political considerations.
As regards the internal aspect of the difficulties of Afghanistan, our stand has been set forth on several occasions, most recently by the President of the Republic, Mr. Najibullah, in his address to the Ninth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade. Allow me to reiterate briefly the main contents of the position of the Republic of Afghanistan.
We believe that dialogue should start among all Afghan political forces inside and outside Afghanistan aimed at holding a nation-wide peace conference with the participation of all forces concerned. The conference should agree on a leadership council and declare a six-month-long cease-fire. During that period the leadership council should establish a broad-based coalition government and create a commission to draft a new Constitution and the law on general elections for its approval. Following the adoption of the new Constitution and the law on elections by a traditional Loya Jirgah called by the leadership council, general elections through direct, secret ballot should be held. A new government formed by one or more political parties enjoying a majority shall govern the country in accordance with the new Constitution. We stand ready for the supervision of the general elections by an international commission.
The Republic of Afghanistan believes that a peaceful political solution must be comprehensive and just, and one in which all political forces must participate. Leaving any political force, including the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan out of the coalition, not only will not solve the problem but will create serious obstacles. The level of participation in the State structure should be subject to negotiation, but participation itself should not. Peace in Afghanistan must come through rational concessions accepted by all. These concessions should be aimed at eradicating all the grounds for conflict and war and not at sowing the seeds of yet another war.
It is an open secret that a great number of commanders have boycotted the leadership of organizations based in Pakistan, realizing their servitude to the enemies of our homeland. A number of commanders have opened talks with the State and they are observing cease-fires in areas under their control. Contacts with others are continuing and, sooner rather than later, cast negative feelings and mistrust will give way to friendship, brotherhood and unity.
The leadership of the Republic of Afghanistan has faith in armed opposition commanders because it is they who will bring the blessings of life and tranquillity to the people in the areas under their control. Similarly, the leadership of the Republic of Afghanistan will continue its policy of national reconciliation despite the irrational position adopted at present by the leaders of extremist organizations based in Pakistan. For us, the national interests of Afghanistan and the restoration of peace in our country are above any group, tribal, ethnic, political, party or ideological interests.
The external aspects of the situation around Afghanistan could best be resolved by convening an international conference with the participation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, China, the United States, the Soviet Union and the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The conference, which at the outset would agree on putting an end to the delivery of weapons to all factions in Afghanistan, should guarantee Afghanistan's permanently neutral and demilitarised status, which would be enshrined in the new Constitution. Because of Pakistani aggression, interference and intervention, the Republic of Afghanistan came before the Security Council in April this year. Except for a very few delegations, the overwhelming majority of countries which participated in the debate supported a political solution and the need for the implantation of the Geneva Agreements. If armed intervention and violation of the Agreements continue. Afghanistan will have no choice but to come before the Security Council once again.
In conclusion. Mr. President, let me reiterate our conviction that by renewing our faith in the principles and goals of the United Nations Charter, we together, under your leadership, can contribute significantly through our deliberations and decisions in this Assembly, to the establishment of a better, safer and more orderly world for all of us to live in. My delegation stands ready to co-operate with you in reaching this goal.
","Today's world, fortunately, is marked by a general relaxation of tension in international relations and improved prospects for finding peaceful and lasting solutions to global and regional problems. The disparities in economic development between developed and developing countries is deepening constantly, while the economic and social situation in most developing countries continues to deteriorate further. When the flames of war, aggression and intervention are still increasingly swallowing up lives and properties of the people of Afghanistan, any claim that the Geneva Agreements' provisions on non-interference and non-intervention are being implemented can obviously not be taken seriously. A positive change in United States policy, from putting the means of war and destruction in the hands of extremists to assisting and contributing to the peace process in Afghanistan, would play a significant role in putting those words into effect. While we express our gratitude to all these countries, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other organizations and agencies for having provided for our Afghan brothers while they were refugees, we believe the time has come for such assistance to be geared towards their repatriation to their homeland and reintegration in the life of their country."

I wish, first of all, to convey to the Ambassador of Nigeria, Major General Joseph Garba, our congratulations on his election as President of this General Assembly. His talents as a diplomat guarantee a substantive contribution to the success of these sessions.
We also wish to acknowledge the positive presidency of his predecessor, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Congressman Dante Caputo.
We also desire to extend our congratulations to the Secretary-General, Ambassador Javier Perez de Cuellar, and his colleagues, for their effective peace-making efforts.
We are pleased that these meetings are being held under the presidency of a representative of the Africa* continent. My Government has always been interested in broadening its relations with the peoples of Africa. It has steadfastly maintained its condemnation of apartheid aid all other forms of discrimination. They are offensive to human dignity. As you know, Mr. President, our ties to Africa are due to the United Nations, especially through our participation in the Committee on Decolonisation and in the United Nations Council for Namibia. We note with satisfaction the progress being made towards the attainment of independence for that Territory.
The Chilean Government wishes to express satisfaction with the renewed vitality and effectiveness of our Organization, which represents a reiteration of the commitment of the international community to the principles of the United Nations Charter.
We likewise note that the new relationships that are being established between the super-Powers are contributing to an improved international political atmosphere. The gentle winds of understanding are opening the way to a better world. Of course, our sense of optimism is not limitless. We continue to have serious concerns with regard to the grave problems which are threatening the peace or which are adversely affecting developing countries.
Regional armed conflicts, poverty, the drug traffic, lack of access to world financial markets, obstacles to international trade, destruction of the environment are problems that still exist. There has been progress towards better understanding but the opportunities for well-being do not reach the great majority of humanity.
As a country that is part of the American community, I wish on this occasion to stress again our solidarity with the peoples of Central America, a region harassed by the action of foreign interests.
My Government also views with profound regret the prolongation of the tragedy afflicting the Lebanese nation. We support the appeal for peace in that region made by His Holiness John Paul II. We are convinced that all non-Lebanese troops should be withdraw from that territory.
Violence continues to distress the peoples of the Middle East. We feel this very deeply because many descendants of the Arabs and the Israelis are part of our Chilean society.
There is no rest for those who champion the cause of peace and the rights of man. Whenever we begin to think that progress is being made in troubled areas, strong forces of reaction threaten that progress. We are still concerned therefore about the citizens of Turkish origin who are being persecuted in Bulgaria. Chile reiterates its support for the universality of the United Nations, and would therefore welcome the desire expressed by the Government of the Republic of Korea for membership in this Organization.
We regret the prolongation of the Cambodian drama. Despite the progress there, we feel that much remains to be done to enable the Cambodian people to recover their right of self-determination and freedom.
In addressing the representatives of the peoples of the world I do so with the satisfaction that comes from speaking in the name of a nation aid a Government that are taking an historic step, overcoming both major domestic and external obstacles. Thanks to the efforts and determination of each and every Chilean, we have built a new society based on political and economic freedoms. From the depths of the crisis that affected us between 1970 and 1973, we have rebuilt our democracy and a strong and prosperous economy. On more than one occasion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile has explained to this Assembly the process we have been following in establishing a secure democracy and a strong, developed economy. We have also announced in advance the precise dates, forms and stages for achieving the transition to full democracy, in accordance with the constitution which was overwhelmingly approved by the voters in 1980 - and the improved text of last July received the broadest popular support in our political history.
There were those who did not wish to acknowledge the power of the rebirth of democracy in Chile, because it meant the end of the totalitarian regime of the 'Popular Unity'. There were also those who did not believe or who questioned the sovereign decision of my Government and my people to establish a free and progressive society. We were the object of discrimination, a double standard and irrational hostility, and then, in the face of Chile's undeniable progress, a conspiracy of silence arose. Only recently has Chile gained the international understanding and recognition its historic achievements deserve. The disinformation, ideologization and scepticism that distorted my country's image have finally given way to objective reality. There has been a positive change within the international community in its attitude towards Chile. The combination of political and economic freedoms is a reality in Chile and stands as the principal achievement of the Government of President Augusto Pinochet.
From adversity, Chile has emerged strengthened. We have shown that foreign pressure cannot overrule the decision of a nation when its cause is just. We have learned that the sovereignty of nations is also a constant challenge. Finally, we have learnt that the only real collaboration between nations is collaboration which recognizes the independence and dignity of all States. The people of Chile is the only people which can choose what the destiny of the Chilean people is to be. Supported by accomplishments and facts, I can affirm that we have carried out what we proposed and what we promised. The Government of President Pinochet has made a reality of the objectives it set for itself in 1974. Freedom of the press, the activities of the most varied political parties, completely open public debate, full individual and trade union rights and economic improvement are, among other things, concrete expressions of a fruitful process of normalization which is not limited to recognition of civic freedoms but recognizes also those freedoms of a social, cultural and economic nature without which any society collapses into frustration. The progress Chile has been achieving in its economy and in modernizing its social structure ensures that democracy will not be a risky, fragile and Utopian adventure.
Chile today is calm and peaceful, and the worth of moderation is new very clearly valued. Op to 1973, ideologized programmes had the upper hand; these were revolutionary in scope, and aimed to change society radically, 'today, on the other hand, only democratic parties have popular support and a chance at the polls.
The progress Chile has made is not the result of foreign inspiration or aid. Chile owes its success aid its bright future to its people and its Government; they have worked hard and not turned from the path laid out by their opinions and traditions. We have a stable currency, sustained growth, controlled inflation and a balanced budget. We have put in place economic freedom that is stimulating the creative initiative of individuals aid recognizes the function of the market rather than the State bureaucracy in allocating resources. Chile's progress and the stability of its Government's policies inspire confidence in those doing business with my country. They know that our word is good, that we keep our promises and that our future belongs to our people.
Progress in Chile has taken us to the threshold of being a developed country. I would like to give you some figures which reflect the sustained progress made by the Chilean economy: real growth in gross domestic product (<3)P) since the 1982 recession has an annual average of close to 6 per cent, and was over 10 per cent in the first six months of this year; more than a million and a half productive jobs have been created over the last five years, reducing the unemployment rate by half j in 1970, Chile exported 400 products to 58 countries, and is now exporting over 1,500 products to 112 countries? in 1973, Chile's exports totalled $1,305 billion, while exports in 1989 will exceed $8 billion; in 1986, the foreign debt peaked at $19.5 billion, and has since been reduced to $16.8 billion. In the social domain, expenditure has been concentrated on the sectors where there is extreme poverty, achieving successes which are the pride of all Chileans. For example, the health indicators show that the infant mortality rate dropped from per thousand in 1970 to 18.8 per thousand in 1988; life expectancy rose from 61.5 years to 71.8 years between 1970 and 1988> and the literacy rate has readied 94.3	per cent.
The changes the world has experienced in the last 16 years have been wide-ranging and profound. The option Chile took in 1973 - its commitment to expansion and freedom - ran counter to many of the dominant trends in the economy and policy of that time. The same policies and sectors which failed in Chile towards the end of the 1960s and the early 1970s managed to establish themselves elsewhere, and now we are witnessing the collapse of the illusions offered by totalitarian and collectivist systems and their eventual demise. Peace itself seems to be gaining strength, and decisions by the main Powers are converging towards a greater degree of understanding and rationality.
The world has become ever more interdependent. Knowledge and science, technology and resources are overcoming boundaries and artificial limits. The same phenomenon is occurring with problems or situations which affect the whole international community and therefore pose a challenge to world co-operation and to this Organization.
One of the greatest challenges facing the international community is the challenge of effectively combating drug trafficking, a scourge which is corrupting society, the family and nations. We join with those Governments which have undertaken to combat such traffic, particularly the Government of Colombia for its courage in confronting the powerful criminal organizations which have taken advantage of that nation.
Since 1973, Chile has kept the most severe manifestations of this problem under control through a rigorous programme of prevention. We are not a drug-producing country, but we have been the victims of the activities of drug traffickers. In September 1973, one of the first acts of the Government was to expel a group of foreign drug traffickers which, taking advantage of the political and social crisis in the country, had set themselves up in northern Chile.
We are convinced that individual action by any one State is not enough: we must join forces. The world has declared war on drugs, but we must make it clear that contingency actions in this war will not solve the problem definitively. The permanent solution is education to strengthen our young people end alert them to the damage drugs do and programmes to help victims recover. To do this, the community of nations must allocate the necessary resources to implement effective education programmes.
We have been expressing our concern about terrorist activities for years now. I should like to take this opportunity to repeat that we repudiate and reject terrorism. We Chileans are particularly conscious of terrorism. We have suffered from its cowardly, irresponsible attacks and more than once have seen how other nations allow the free transit of know terrorists claiming political immunity. If modern societies wish to overcome, once and for all, terrorism and narco-terrorism Which is threatening to engulf us all, we must act decisively. No nation should offer them shelter or facilitate their movements.
On occasion, certain international organizations have permitted the human rights question to be manipulated systematically. Attempts have been made to politicize it and even to include the legitimate fight against terrorism and subversion under the phrase 'violations of human rights'. We are not disregarding in this context the inviolable rights inherent in every human being. But we condemn the gross manipulation of human rights which, at its very heart, demonstrates that there is no real respect for what is said -falsely - to be respected. Human rights must be respected by all nations without exception, but must not be manipulated.
It is neither just nor balanced to make facile pronouncements on the painful events that some nations, such as Chile, had to experience in overcoming subversion and terrorist violence. In our case, these were the result of the political upheaval aid breakdown of our society from 1970 to 1973. We must bear in mind the root causes and the general context of the disruption of the peaceful life of our peoples.
In Chile we have been able to build a society in which human rights are protected not only by democratic institutions and the rule of law, but also by Chileans' respect for each other's individual freedom, values and beliefs. Those rights are also protected by the spirit of understanding that prevails in Chile.
For our part, we have decided to build a new future for Chile, and to accept the implications of our own past.
In 1978 the Government of Chile adopted an amnesty law as the corner-stone of our efforts to pacify and unite the com try. Amnesty is the juridical course of prudence, of reconciliation and of commitment to a peaceful Chile - the common goal of the vast majority of the Chilean people. For the sake of the future of everyone, we believe it is necessary to put the past behind us, to heal rather than reopen wounds. The people aid the Government of Chile are firmly committed to continuing to advance on the road of unity and peace which they have always followed.
International co-operation is the basis of peace and progress. The world is advancing toward the creation of expanded free-trade markets. An outstanding example is the European Community.
We find reason for hope in the prospects that the twenty-first century holds for nations capable of facing the challenges of the future. That hope is based on the fact that the free-trade agreements will inevitably be extended to Latin America, which is moving forward in accordance with the prevailing trend towards greater economic freedom.
Chile wishes to promote effective Latin American integration. It is necessary to modify the present approaches based on the artificial strategy of imports, restraint's on foreign investment, and regional markets strictly protected and regulated by the State. We believe that, instead, those approaches should conform to the prevailing trends towards privatisation, elimination of customs barriers, a free market and the negotiation of general agreements that would enable the region to swim with the tide of progress and to move towards ever-freer flows of goods and services offering opportunities to everyone. The conditions have been created for true regional economic integration that would expand the agreements reached in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Chile has made every effort to accommodate its economy to those trends, convinced as we are that this is the preliminary step to the broad aid modern integration that will enhance Latin America's promising prospects. However, we also view those prospects with concern because the trade negotiations aid associations of the industrialized nations could become de facto protectionist barriers against trade with the rest of the world.
The recent experience of the unfair embargo on the export of Chilean fruits - which, for reasons that remain obscure, was temporarily excluded from world markets - demonstrates not only the complexities of international trade, but also the danger of protectionism on the part of the developed nations, which can halt the exports of the developing countries aid inflict serious damage on their economies.
Our peoples want to move with the great currents of world progress. They do not want to receive 'humanitarian assistance' in exchange for protectionism, which maintains imbalances harmful to the developing nations. What we want is equality of opportunity, just and equitable treatment. I am sure that on the basis of such equal treatment and mutual respect my country and many others will be able to advance securely on the road of growth aid to meet the foreign-debt obligations which weigh so heavily on our economies.
Nevertheless, a large foreign debt entails great sacrifices of our peoples' standard of living and slows production aid consumption in creditor as well as debtor countries. Everyone involved in this cycle must join forces to overcome it.
It is not an exaggeration to say that the re-evaluation of the dollar, high international interest rates, and protectionism have been the direct causes of the present debt problem.
A plan for co-operation and co-ordination between the industrialized nations has served as a complement to the Bretton Woods institutions. But in that co-ordination the interests of the developing world have not been adequately represented. The monetary discipline on the part of the industrialized nations that would take into account our countries' economic needs has not emerged.
Chile's foreign policy is based on the principles of international law and on the goals of peace and co-operation. Those goals are linked not only to the promotion of the national interest within the community of nations but also to the promotion of the common good at the international level. In our country's actions in multilateral forums, we are firmly committed to the promotion of peace, friendship and co-operation between States.
We are living in a dynamic era. But the enduring human values - truth, justice, equality and freedom - must be maintained.
Present international relations are marked -- as they will also be in the future - by a growing freedom from ideologies; by the diffusion of power among many centres of decision-making aid influence; by the globalisation of relations between nations as a product of the clear and growing interdependence of all spheres of human activity, aid, finally, by the growth of a consensus on the role of the individual, his creative capacity and his initiative as the most dynamic elements in the social process.
We are living in a new age. Some very difficult times, which seriously threatened the idea of co-operation between nations as well as human freedom, have been left behind. We have reason to be optimistic. Ahead of us lies a world of opportunities. Chile is determined to face the challenges with the decisiveness characteristic of young and confident nations.
","As a country that is part of the American community, I wish on this occasion to stress again our solidarity with the peoples of Central America, a region harassed by the action of foreign interests. The same phenomenon is occurring with problems or situations which affect the whole international community and therefore pose a challenge to world co-operation and to this Organization. In Chile we have been able to build a society in which human rights are protected not only by democratic institutions and the rule of law, but also by Chileans' respect for each other's individual freedom, values and beliefs. Nevertheless, a large foreign debt entails great sacrifices of our peoples' standard of living and slows production aid consumption in creditor as well as debtor countries.

I am privileged to be afforded this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Garba on his election to the office of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly, secure in the knowledge that his vast and varied experience will serve to ensure a fruitful and constructive session.
I would also like to express my delegation's appreciation and congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the able manner in which he presided over the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
The Commonwealth of Dominica is a firm believer in the principles espoused and the goals pursued by the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies. We have been particularly heartened by the significant role played by the United Nations in the redaction of tension and the resolution of conflicts in the recent past. Foreign troops have departed from Afghanistan and Kampuchea, there is a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and preparations are under way for free elections in Namibia.
It now remains for the people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to resolve their internal conflicts and reach for that peace that has unfortunately eluded them for so long.
The United Nations has been rediscovered, as it were, as a mediator, and that bodes well for the future of the Organization and for peace in the world. It demonstrates that this body can operate with some effectiveness once we abandon our contentious attitude and discard the ideological blinders that so often deter efforts to find solutions to the many problems confronting the international community today.
My delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General and his staff for the progress trade towards free elections in Namibia aid a foreseeable end to the domination of that country by South Africa. The struggle for free expression by all the peoples of southern Africa must, however, continue apace. We need not be reminded that a minority regime continues to dominate and repress the black majority in South Africa. We cannot take any comfort from the intimations of a President whose authority is validated by the evil that is apartheid and who, in the service of the white minority, is bent on the preservation and perpetuation of a system that is abhorrent to the civilized world. In the context of apartheid, gradualism is unacceptable. As long as apartheid exists we cannot, as Members of the United Nations, rest easy. That evil must be eradicated completely, and no effort should be spared in that regard.
The Commonwealth of Dominica believes that only stringent, comprehensive and effective measures by all nations will force the minority Government in South Africa to heed the call for peaceful change to a society of men and women of all races freely participating in all facets of the affairs of their country.
The immediate lifting of restrictions on the press, the end of the state of emergency, and the release of Nelson Mandela aid all other political prisoners would be, in our view, the preliminary indications of the Pretoria regime's intention in good faith to bring about the peaceful change desired by all people of good will.
The extent of human rights abuses in various parts of the world is nothing short of appalling. Members of the Organization, in keeping with the relevant provisions of the Charter, have a duty to denounce any violation of human rights in the strongest possible terms. Adherence to and respect for the principles of the United Nations require every Member to speak up loudly against all human rights abuses, whether it is the brutal repression and massacre of students peacefully seeking democratic change in Asia or the indiscriminate killing of innocent women and children in local conflicts in Africa, Central America or elsewhere. We must untiringly work for a world where the fundamental rights of men and women everywhere are protected against abuse from the State.
The Commonwealth of Dominica welcomes the new spirit of co-operation, openness and frequent discussion between the United States and the Soviet Union. The improvement in super-Power relations and its attendant lessening of tension in the world is an encouraging sign and we fervently hope the process, which has already led to a better climate for international peace and security, will continue, notwithstanding the immense obstacles posed by reactionary forces on both sides. One of the benefits of the new understanding is the recently signed Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and current proposals for further education about the stockpile of nuclear weapons, which is still unacceptable large. We dare to hope that one day the world will be free of the fear of nuclear war, but that hope is tempered by the alarming proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
The production and distribution of conventional weapons, ever increasing in sophistication and destructiveness, continue to cause problems for regional stability. The appetite for those weapons grows daily, especially in countries strapped for resources to provide the basic economic and social needs of their people. At a time when common sense should dictate a reordering of priorities, many nations irrationally opt for destruction rather than construction. As lamentable as that policy appears to be, there is little hope for its reversal as long as the preservation of power by a few takes precedence over the utilization of power for the good of the many.
At this time every year we make mention of the dangerous state of instability in the Middle East. Division, mistrust end irrationality continues to fuel the conflicts in that area. The international community looks on helplessly as the State of Lebanon is destroyed. As we assemble here the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that once flourishing nation are being violated by the presence of foreign troops on its soil. Its capital city has been reduced to rubble by warring factions. The people of Lebanon deserve a better fate.
Prospects for a solution to the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza appear bleak because the underlying issues have not been adequately and seriously addressed. Proclaiming the right of Israel to exist within secure boundaries is only half of an equation which also requires recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination end to a homeland. The question is forced upon us: does the international community lack the will, inclination or purpose of spirit to endeavour to find solutions to the problems of the Middle East, and are we relegated to the task of adopting resolutions, or even to matters like perennially querying the credentials of Israel, that prove meaningless to the people in that region, whose lives are destroyed on a daily basis?
International terrorism continues to be a cons tent threat to the world aid we should recognize it in all its ugly disguises, so that we are the better able to deal with it effectively. Acts of terrorism violate the fundamental tenets of the civilized world community, threatening the democratic freedoms of all mankind. As Members of the United Nations we must band ourselves together to rid the world of this evil, taking every practical measure to conquer the terrorists no matter what their ideological stand.
As with international terrorism, the scourge of illicit drugs must be of immediate concern to all Members of this body. No hope for a halt in the trade in illicit drugs can be entertained unless a concerted international effort, co-ordinated by the United Nations, is undertaken. The problem knows no boundary; it respects no ideology or power; it makes no distinction between rich and poor. North and South, East and West. Its engine is driven by the prospect of the huge fortunes capable of being amassed clandestinely and quickly. Nations which once connived at the production of illegal drugs for export have belatedly discovered the pain and misery of drug abuse among their own people.
The Commonwealth of Dominica, like most Members of the Organization, has laws strictly prohibiting the production, distribution and use of illegal drugs. Punishment is swift and certain. But small countries like ours cannot hope to match the resources and organizational effort at the command of those engaged in this unwholesome activity and, from all appearances, a solution to the problem of illicit drugs is beyond the capacity of even the most well-endowed communities acting alone.
Universal in its destructive force, the illegal drug problem presents a unique challenge to the world and an opportunity for co-operative action on an unprecedented scale. As Members of the United Nations we must accept the challenge, and for the sake of humanity we cannot fail to seize the opportunity here and now. Some matters which were of foremost importance 44 years ago have, in some instances, assumed less significance on the agenda, but essentially the United Nations must still make every effort to ensure that we live in a better world. And a better world encompasses a safe environment for all the inhabitants of this earth. The United Nations involvement in the identification of environmental problems and the search for solutions is commendable, but nations must all do more, both collectively and individually, to protect the environment in which we live.
Depending on the economics of the situation, the origin of the problem takes different forms. Industrialized countries are confronted with huge amounts of deleterious waste resulting from the production of an expending variety of goods and services to meet the demands of their customer-driven societies, while the struggle for economic survival in third world countries unfortunately end unavoidably results in the depletion and destruction of ecological systems vital to the balance necessary for maintaining a safe environment. We believe that, given the present state of technology, economic and industrial development is not necessarily incompatible with a healthy environment, aid the development and implementation of programmes for the safe disposal of industrial waste should not be postponed indefinitely. As a complement to that effort we call for increased assistance to those countries which are lacking in the resources necessary for the protection and preservation of important ecological systems.
Citizens of developing countries have the same right to a clean and safe environment as their counterparts in the industrialized world, and the cynical practice of inducing third-world countries to accept waste hazardous to the environment should cease. It is in the interest of all of us to take steps to protect the entire planet.
I am convinced that unless we take a good hard look at ourselves at regular intervals we shall merely continue to meander along with no purpose, with no goal and a good deal of indecision. At a time of budgetary constraints the United Nations can ill afford to react to every whimsical suggestion of every Member State. There are, I believe, sufficient and adequate resolutions of this body on every issue - resolutions which, if implemented, would go a long way to curing the ills of the world. With courage, determination and purposeful commitment, we can make this earth a better and safer place for all its inhabitants.

 
","The Commonwealth of Dominica believes that only stringent, comprehensive and effective measures by all nations will force the minority Government in South Africa to heed the call for peaceful change to a society of men and women of all races freely participating in all facets of the affairs of their country. The improvement in super-Power relations and its attendant lessening of tension in the world is an encouraging sign and we fervently hope the process, which has already led to a better climate for international peace and security, will continue, notwithstanding the immense obstacles posed by reactionary forces on both sides. The question is forced upon us: does the international community lack the will, inclination or purpose of spirit to endeavour to find solutions to the problems of the Middle East, and are we relegated to the task of adopting resolutions, or even to matters like perennially querying the credentials of Israel, that prove meaningless to the people in that region, whose lives are destroyed on a daily basis? But small countries like ours cannot hope to match the resources and organizational effort at the command of those engaged in this unwholesome activity and, from all appearances, a solution to the problem of illicit drugs is beyond the capacity of even the most well-endowed communities acting alone. Industrialized countries are confronted with huge amounts of deleterious waste resulting from the production of an expending variety of goods and services to meet the demands of their customer-driven societies, while the struggle for economic survival in third world countries unfortunately end unavoidably results in the depletion and destruction of ecological systems vital to the balance necessary for maintaining a safe environment."
44,1989,UKR,"ï»¿
It gives the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic great pleasure to greet the representative of Nigeria, Mr. Garba, as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Many years of co-operation with him have convinced us that he will fulfil his high duties with honour and dignity. Please convey to him our heartiest congratulations on his election.
The prospects of an era of peace in international relations and of the consistent implementation of related tasks for multilateral co-operation among States can open up an entirely new phase in world history. If that were to come to pass, succeeding generations, saved from the scourge of war, would pay fitting tribute to those present in this Hall as contributors to and joint authors of that process. 
It is noteworthy that a number of representatives, as well as the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization, found it necessary to recall the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War and to speak about its lessons. The Ukrainian delegation deems that appropriate and logical. The peoples of the Soviet Union, including the Ukrainian people, bore the brunt of the war and sustained its heaviest losses. At the same time, they made the most significant contribution towards saving the peoples of Europe from Fascist enslavement. The liberating mission of the Soviet Union is indelibly printed in the grateful memory of nations. To forget, let alone to ignore the fact, would be to desecrate the sacred memory of the fallen and to insult the living. The lessons of history shall not fall into oblivion.
The wheel of history cannot be reversed. The inviolability of post-war borders constitutes the foundation of peaceful relations in Europe. We share the clear and unambiguous position expressed in that regard by the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
We are encouraged and heartened to see the promising and positive changes in international relations gathering momentum and becoming ever more teal and tangible. Tensions have eased and confrontation has diminished, fruitful political dialogue is emerging between States, confidence is growing and injecting an entirely new, peaceful note into international relations. There is a growing trend towards ensuring global security not through an arms build-up but through agreed reductions in arms. A new world order is taking shape based on the primacy of international law, the renunciation of confrontation and enmity in favour of confidence and good-neighbourliness, and mutual regard for the interests of countries and peoples. There is a growing awareness of the need to elaborate generally acceptable approaches to global challenges, to seek universal consensus and to achieve comprehensive international security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
The time has come for concrete action that would allow, without excessive reliance on methods involving military force, the activation of the mechanism of political and legal restraint, as well as the peacemaking potential of the non-military components of security. The United Nations can and should play a major role in that respect. The Ukrainian delegation is in favour of making the most effective use of United Nations potential to prevent crises and maintain international peace and security. We are firmly convinced that it is through the United Nations and with its assistance that a secure and non-violent world can be established, the first outlines of which can be discerned even today.
The path leading to such a world is not an easy one. There remain many roadblocks, chief among which is the arms race. Only disarmament can ensure progress towards a secure future. The beneficial influence of the first practical results of disarmament on the overall political climate in the world can already be felt today. Those results are clearly stimulating negotiations in other areas.
The order of the day is nuclear disarmament. In that context, an early conclusion of an agreement between the USSR and the United States on a 50 per cent reduction of strategic offensive arms is of paramount importance, as is the eventual complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The strategy of nuclear deterrence is clearly indefensible. It essentially means the perpetuation of nuclear weapons with all the fatal consequences they entail.
The question of halting all nuclear testing has become of special importance. It is central in keeping the general nuclear-weapons situation under control. The Ukrainian delegation supports the calls for early consideration by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament of the problem relating to a comprehensive nuclear-test ban. The proposals to extend the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water to underground tests could be considered as one way of addressing the problem. A mutual Soviet-United States moratorium on all nuclear tests could serve as a prelude to a verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban agreement.
Should the armsÂ· race extend to outer space, international security would be undermined in an unpredictable way, and the threat of global catastrophe would increase immeasurably. Outer space must remain peaceful and open for international co-operation in its exploration for the benefit of all nations. In that context, we have high hopes for the Soviet-United States dialogue and the intensified effort towards practical results on the work of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. 
Today real conditions exist for the total and global elimination of chemical stockpiles and a ban on development and production of these weapons. The encouraging progress achieved in Geneva, where work on a convention banning chemical weapons and eliminating stockpiles of them is in its final stage, as well as the Soviet-United States approach to this issue, are proof of that. The Ukrainian delegation believes that the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session must urge the Conference on Disarmament to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion at the earliest possible date. The conclusion of a convention would undoubtedly make a major contribution to the process of real disarmament, started by the elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate and shorter-range nuclear missiles, and would signify its diversification and its elevation to the multilateral level.
There should be no areas closed to disarmament talks. A comprehensive approach to solving disarmament problems would appear to be the most productive. The progress of negotiations in Vienna confirms that this is an entirely justified and realistic way of dealing with the issue. Proposals and counter-proposals advanced by the War saw Treaty and North Atlantic Treaty Organization member States have opened up a teal prospect of reaching early agreement on a gradual switchover to a defensive military doctrine and to the development of armed forces on the principle of reasonable sufficiency.
As the socialist countries members of the Warsaw Treaty organization stated at the Bucharest meeting of the Political Consultative Committee, they see the immediate goal of negotiations to be the establishment, as early as in a first-stage agreement, of common ceilings, equal for both alliances, on the aggregate numbers of troops and the amounts of main types of armaments in Europe and its various parts. New levels would be considerably lower than the current lowest levels of either side. 
Drastic reductions of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe in the next few years, coupled with a phased reduction and, ultimately, elimination of tactical nuclear weapons, would be are effective means of reducing the risk of war. It would make the disarmament process universal and contribute to enhanced confidence.
On the subject of confidence-building measures, let me stress the special importance that the Ukrainian SSR attaches to developing and expanding measures. We are in favour of extending confidence-building, observation and limitation measures to cover all kinds of military activity, including naval and air force activities. kind of armed forces or armaments should be exempt from the negotiating process.
Our position of principle is to ensure a dynamic transition from individual confidence-building measures, openness and glasnost in international relations to a large-scale policy of confidence in all spheres of military activity without exception as an integral part of security and peace on Earth.
 A sine qua non for ensuring international security is an effective verification regime. We are firmly convinced that it should embrace all aspects of the disarmament process, leading to the establishment of a comprehensive disarmament verification system. The United Nations can, and indeed must, make a substantial contribution to it.
Recently we have often heard concern voiced at the fact that multilateral disarmament measures are lagging behind bilateral ones. This situation should be remedied. Prospects of multilateral disarmament would look much better if the Security Council, pursuant to Article 26 of the United Nations Charter, were to take & meaningful interest in the ,maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion ... of the world's human and economic resources, for the cause of armaments. In other words, it should seek to ensure security at the lowest possible levels of armament in individual States - levels sufficient for their defence but insufficient for offence.
The initial steps taken towards real disarmament open up prospects of channelling resources released in this way to meeting the needs of social and economic development. The problem of converting military production to civilian use is now being addressed in practical terms.
Conversion undoubtedly poses complicated problems, involving retooling and reorienting plants and re-employing and retraining personnel, and so on. It therefore seems all the more necessary to pool our efforts to solve those problems at all levels - national, regional and global - drawing upon the experience so far accumulated in this area.
We haveÂ· every hope that the United Nations and its specialized agencies will conduct specific studies and make recommendations on individual aspects of the problem. It is essential, however, that the United Nations should be able to collect all information available and thus become a kind of centre for developing a global strategy on converting military production. Many conversion studies conducted both in the East end in the West have demonstrated that conversion not only is feasible but will also have positive social and economic effects.
What is becoming increasingly clear is that military expenditures slow down economic, technological and social development. It is to be regretted that that these conclusions have not been supported everywhere. Nevertheless, we would like to hope that a conversion in thinking is not too far off either. What we need is to share our experience on an international scale and to work out together approaches to, and criteria for, converting military production. Disarmament is important - and not just as an end in itself. It should become an additional resource for raising the living standards of peoples and giving them tangible benefits. In our view  the famous phrase ,We shall beat swords into ploughshares, is an apt description of the indivisible triad of disarmament  conversion and development.
Now let me make one final point on the problems of disarmament. This concerns the role of the public  of parliaments - citizens' diplomacy. We should like to see the international public exerting even more vigorous efforts in the context of the World Campaign for Disarmament. The United Nations seminar on multilateral confidence-building and war-preventing measures held last September in Kiev proved that such projects were useful. The Ukrainian SSR intends to continue its support for activities related to the World Campaign for Disarmament.
Over decades the entire system of international relations has been in a state of tension generated by regional conflicts. The last year  however  has brought us the first gleams of hope.
We needed a policy that would take into account the realities of the nuclear age so as to make headway in attaining a political settlement of existing crises. We needed new thinking that would give us a view of the world not in the light of confrontation and a balance of forces  but in the light of a balance of interests  We can new speak about a new situation. A chain reaction of positive changes, varying in scale and importance, has affected almost all regional crises. A kind of pattern for settling them is taking shape. Typically, it features a realistic approach to evaluating the actual state of affairs in conflict areas, the political will and readiness to reach compromise, a quest for national reconciliation with no external interference# the use by the major parties to the conflict of negotiating machinery with United Nations mediation and under its auspices, and the establishment of an institution of international guarantors.
We are highly appreciative of the contribution made by the United Nations to the drafting and conclusion of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan. The Organization should play a major role now as well, in ending the bloodshed and attaining political solutions in Afghanistan affairs, as provided for in the Geneva Agreements and the resolution adopted at the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The United Nations, and above all, its Secretary-General, are able actively to promote intra-Afghan dialogue and to establish the machinery for a political settlement enlisting the involvement of Afghanistan's neighbours.
The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Mr. Abdul Wakil, proposed here a clear and constructive plan for an Afghanistan settlement. Regarding the plan's external aspects, the situation around Afghanistan could be best settled by an international conference, to be attended by Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, China, the United States, the Soviet Union and the country serving as Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. It would be convened for the purpose of reaching agreement on ending supplies of weapons to the warring parties and guaranteeing Afghanistan's status as a demilitarised and neutral State, friendly towards its neighbours.
These provisions would be included in the country's new Constitution. Such an approach to, and a way out of, the crisis is fully in keeping with the imperatives and spirit of the times.
The general trend towards improved international relations, reduced tensions, and the diminished risk of war has cleared the way for a settlement in the Middle East. The world has, by and large, come to realize that this calls for collective efforts at an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations which would offer an opportunity for the parties to the conflict to reach a historic compromise. It could undertake an exhaustive examination of the proposals designed to attain a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. Prospects for a non-violent solution to the impasse caused by a longstanding confrontation have emerged in southern Africa as well. At the same time, it is quite clear that the dynamics and endurance of a solution to the problems facing southern Africa are directly proportional to the speed with which the dismantling of the apartheid regime can proceed, for the regimes is the toot cause of the region's tensions. The international community must do its utmost to bar the apartheid regime's admittance to the third millennium.
Encouraging steps have been taken towards a real settlement in Central America. They make it incumbent upon all the members of the international community to support the still fragile process towards reaching a final settlement that would accommodate the interests of all the parties concerned. We commend highly the agreement reached by the five Central American Presidents as well as their awareness of the region's problems and their wisdom, audacity and realism. We welcome the constructive and flexible position of the Nicaraguan Government, which is complying faithfully and scrupulously with its obligations and showing its genuine interest in bringing peace to the region.
Like all other States, we have an interest in establishing a zone of peace, co-operation and neutrality in South-East Asia. The road towards this goal lies through achieving a settlement in Cambodia. The withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia creates the necessary conditions and prerequisites for a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian problem. This involves measures to prevent civil war and genocide and to adopt international guarantees for Cambodia's status as an independent, peaceful, neutral and non-aligned State.
The implementation of proposals put forward by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea on the peaceful, democratic reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from the territory of that nation would promote peace and security on the Korean peninsula and clear the way for a unified Korea to join the United Nations.
We advocate broad and constructive interaction among all members of the international community in eliminating hotbeds of tension through political means on a just, honest and, hence, solid basis. All States, great and small alike, and international organizations - above all, the United Nations - have an important contribution to make to this end.
Our Organization has not yet fully tapped its potential in conflict-prevention. The resources of the Security Council and the possibilities of the Secretary-General have not yet been fully utilized. We share the conclusions in the report of the Secretary-General on the role and significance of preventive diplomacy.
While duly recognizing the current positive trends in political relations among States, we cannot but note the lack of real progress in the development of the economic interaction of States. The situation of the world economy remains unstable, and existing problems are getting worse.
The economic situation of developing countries is particularly disturbing. They are still suffering from backwardness, external debt, inequality in international trade and various kinds of protectionist and other unlawful measures used by the strong against the weak. The present system of international economic relations does not meet the interests of the overwhelming majority of States and is undemocratic.
The growing economic interdependence of States and the internationalisation of economic life has set the stage for the development of co-operation and healthier international economic relations. These goals have been advanced by the production, at the United Nations, of the idea of international economic security, aimed at achieving an equitable, generally advantageous and generally acceptable state of the world economy and international economic relations and at creating conditions for peaceful coexistence and co-operation among all States, regardless of their level of development or of their socio-economic system.
In recent years the environment issue has firmly established itself on the list of international priority problems. The problem of environmental protection can be resolved effectively only at the global level. We very much appreciate the role of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in mobilizing the efforts of the world community to prevent environmental catastrophe. We need to develop and improve the potential of the United Nations in monitoring, assessing and predicting threats to the environment and in providing relief assistance in case of environmental emergencies. The Ukrainian SSR supports the idea of setting up, within the framework of the United Nations, a centre for urgent environmental assistance. The work of that centre could bring the conservation efforts of international organizations to a new and higher level and would be a practical contribution to overcoming environmental crises.
The international conference on environment and development, scheduled for 1992, will have to draft a world strategy for environmental survival. The proposed mandate of the conference is almost perfectly in keeping with the goals and purposes of the international environmental security concept initiated by the Ukrainian SSR, together with Czechoslovakia and other countries.
We hear more and more people demanding that protection of the environmental health of the planet be placed on a solid foundation of international co-operation. That gives us the hope that environmental security will be ensured and that the environment will not suffer irreparable damage. As was pointed out at the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, it is criminal to drain the world economy through the arms race and to ignore the need for preserving man's habitat. 
Today, more than ever before, the correctness of a country's historical direction is to be judged by the human dimension of its domestic and foreign policy. A State's participation in united Nations humanitarian activities and its rejection of double standards is a clear indication that it cares about people and is striving to preserve universal human values. I should like to address just one aspect of this topic.
Virtually all those- who have spoken during the general debate have voiced great concern about the problem of drug abuse. Possessing huge financial resources, criminal drug trafficking syndicates are undermining the political and economic foundations of States and ate entangling governmental and judicial institutions in a web of corruption. Millions of people are losing their health, and even their lives, to drugs. No one can overcome this evil single-handedly. Only joint efforts can produce the desired result. International conferences on drug-abuse control have demonstrated that the world community is serious in combating this scourge. The Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and other instruments adapted to fight drug abuse were the result of the growing awareness among States of the global nature of this problem.
The international co-operation that has clearly emerged in this field must be developed further. What is necessary is close interaction and co-ordinated efforts in combating drug trafficking and drug abuse. We believe that the United Nations could take the next logical step in this direction by proclaiming a decade for combating drug abuse and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs.
The Ukrainian delegation is prepared to submit a draft resolution on the subject for consideration at this session of the General Assembly. The General Assembly could ask the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Narcotic Drug? to draft a programme for such a decade to be adopted by the General Assembly.
At the heart of such Ð° programme as we see it, there would be measures for the effective implementation of conventions to fight drug abuse and the 1987 Interdisciplinary Plan, as well as activities sponsored by the United Nations Fund to combat drug abuse, and the integration of efforts at the national level. The convening of an appropriate international conference could constitute one of the stages of the programme. The conference could review progress in implementing the programme for the decade and decide on further steps.
Finally, the Ukrainian SSR is prepared to co-operate actively with all countries in strengthening the international legal order and drafting specific measures to enhance the role of international law. In our view, a decade of international law, proposed by the non-aligned countries, could promote this objective. Our policy of asserting the supremacy of international law is intimately related to the process of creating our own State based on a genuine rule of law. Bringing the norms of domestic legislation, into full conformity with its international obligations, the Ukrainian SSR stands in solidarity with all States that are also striving to achieve higher standards of legal protection for the individual.
The renaissance of the United Nations is linked with renewed hopes for a peaceful future. We hope that efforts to create a world in much peaceful, civilized relations among States and nations rule supreme will meet with the support of all delegations attending the forty-fourth session. We hope that the work of the General Assembly will impart a new impetus to progress towards a more secure future and help turn the United Nations into an effective instrument of peace.
","Tensions have eased and confrontation has diminished, fruitful political dialogue is emerging between States, confidence is growing and injecting an entirely new, peaceful note into international relations. The time has come for concrete action that would allow, without excessive reliance on methods involving military force, the activation of the mechanism of political and legal restraint, as well as the peacemaking potential of the non-military components of security.

44,1989,KEN,"ï»¿My President, Mr. Daniel Arap has directed me to convey to you, Mr. President, his best wishes for a successful forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this body. Africa is proud to see one of her illustrious sons occupy this lofty chair. You can, Sir, count on my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of your duties in directing the affairs of the Assembly.
I should also like to convey to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, former Foreign Minister of Argentina, my delegation's sincere appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he presided over and guided the affairs of this Organization during its forty-third session. The international political scene continues to undergo encouraging and positive developments in the search for solutions to regional and global problems. The past few years have witnessed previously inconceivable progress in long-standing disputes and conflicts and much of this progress has been the result of a renewed optimism and faith in the relevance and role of the United Nations. This Organization, whose fundamental principle is the maintenance of international peace and security, has consistently striven to demonstrate the superiority of negotiations and mediation over confrontation in the conduct of international relations. The increasing success in global acceptance of this process is in no small measure due to the effective and outstanding leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and I express my delegation's sincere appreciation of his untiring efforts in promoting the objectives of the United Nations.
The important contributions this Organization made towards resolving regional conflicts in 1988 have been further expanded in 1989 to include the independence process for Namibia. Similarly, there are encouraging signs that the United Nations will be required to play a pivotal role in the resolution of the Kampuchean problem and the crises in Central America. Those heavy responsibilities cannot be effectively carried out without the full support of all members of the international community. Kenya wishes to put on record its total support for all United Nations efforts aimed at securing international peace. We urge all Members of this body to extend similar support and to work towards a better world in which human suffering can be alleviated and wanton waste of resources avoided.
Kenya fully supports and highly commends the Secretary-General and his staff for their exemplary work in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1 .8) on Namibia, but we are gravely concerned at South Africa's continued
refusal to abide by the spirit and letter of that resolution. The presence of the brutal counter-insurgency Koevoet forces, in Namibia was maintained long past the deadline for their disbarment, and the laws and proclamations relating to the electoral process and the Constituent Assembly were drafted in terms that were incompressible even to the educated elite. The laws as drafted then were to facilitate the continued rule of Namibia by South Africa. The racist regime in South Africa, to use the words of President Bush, 'failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart'. (A/44/PV. 4, p. 52) We hope that the amended laws to be published soon will make possible free and fair elections in November. Thus Kenya urgently calls on the international community to put pressure on South Africa to abide fully with resolution 435 (1978) in order to avoid a situation where the elections lead to more chaos and suffering rather than the peace we so dearly desire.
With regard to the situation in South Africa itself, we are hopeful that the change in leadership will not be merely a change in persons. We in Kenya expect the new leadership to take truly positive and progressive steps towards a humane society in which all peoples, regardless of race, can live in harmony. However, until that time, we remain gravely concerned that, despite repeated calls for change, the racist Pretoria regime has continued to enforce its abhorrent system of apartheid and has continued to deny its black majority population its inalienable right to self-determination. We demand the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, the lifting of the State of Emergency, an end to the brutalisation of the black population, including innocent children, the engaging of the press and the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and other political organizations. We remain convinced that, unless immediate and effective pressure is applied on Pretoria, peaceful change will not be possible.
We are equally convinced that the only means at the disposal of the international community to effect positive change is through the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime, in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. As President Bush told us on Monday here in this Assembly, 'freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of its own'; 'we must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings'; 'Make no mistake, nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march.' (A/44/PV. 4)
The odious policies of apartheid are the main source of conflict in the southern Africa region. That poses a serious threat to both regional and international peace and security. Pretoria's persistent acts of aggression and destabilization against front-line and other neighbouring States continue to wreak havoc on their economies while the influx of refugees escaping Pretoria's brutality further strain limited resources available for social development. Kenya urges the international community to provide financial and material assistance to front-line and other neighbouring States in order to assist them in reducing their economic dependence on South Africa, thereby lessening the impact of Pretoria's destabilization.
Encouraging developments in some spheres of international relations only serve to underscore the need to do wore in areas where little or no progress has been made. Kenya remains deeply concerned that no positive developments have been recorded regarding the Palestinian question. The world has witnessed a rapid deterioration in the overall condition of the Palestinian people. We are convinced that no just and lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle East until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized, including their right to self-determination and to a State of their own, as already proclaimed. We commend their leaders for the positive steps they have taken towards a resolution of the Palestinian question.
We continue to be distressed at the dangerous escalation of violence in Lebanon, and we urgently call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese territory and for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire as advanced recently by the Arab League. We support all efforts of the Arab League to resolve this tragic crisis and call on the entire international community to fully respect Lebanon's territorial integrity and its right to exercise its sovereignty within its internationally recognized boundaries.
Kenya welcomes the positive developments that have been made in the search for a solution to the Kampuchean problem. We welcome Viet Nam's decision to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea by the end of this month, and fully support all efforts undertaken by the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to arrive at a just and lasting solution to the problem. Similarly, we are heartened by the continued search for a solution to the Cyprus question and also by the regional initiatives undertaken by the Presidents of Central America to achieve a peaceful climate in that sub region.
In the Korean peninsula, we support the admission of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations. We are also encouraged by the renewal of the dialogue and contacts between the two Koreas, with a view to achieving the peaceful reunification of their two countries for the mutual benefit of all Korean people. We wish them the best of luck in working out the modalities for attaining this cherished goal. The Korean problem will be solved only by the Korean people themselves.
In Afghanistan, we note with satisfaction the successful implementation of the Geneva Accords. It is now incumbent upon the Afghan people, however, to settle their internal problems without interference or pressure from any quarter so that peace and tranquillity can return to that country, which has suffered for so long.
In all these aspects, Kenya firmly remains unswerving in its commitment to the right of all peoples to determine their own future, free of outside interference or pressure.
It is Kenya's belief that disarmament is a moral imperative of the international community, if the basic objective of maintaining international peace and security is to be achieved. The continued accumulation of sophisticated and lethal nuclear and conventional weapons continues to threaten the survival of mankind. But we remain hopeful that the improved relations and intensified bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers as highlighted here by President Bush on Monday will have a positive impact on the global disarmament efforts and lead to the easing of tension in the world as a whole.
As we approach the end of the decade of the 1980s, the world economy continues to cause concern. According to the 1989 World Economic Survey, global economic output grew by the high rate of 4.3 per cent in 1988. World trade increased by an even faster rate of 8.3 per cent, exceeding the rates achieved in the 1970s. But virtually all the benefits of the expansion in world output and trade accrued and continue to accumulate in favour of the industrialized countries. The expectation that the benefits of growth in the world economic output would trickle down and spread to more developing countries has not been realized. Under current trends, prospects for the future point to a deterioration of the situation. What we need is an environment of improved international economic co-operation based on the reality of the growing interdependence among national economies. We believe that this session presents many opportunities for finding ways and means of managing such interdependence. Developing countries must play a more meaningful and beneficial part in the world economic activity and decision-making. The benefit of global growth and expansion must be enjoyed by all the nations of the world.
As the Economic Survey rightly puts it:
'In a global view, it is an anomaly that the richest country in the world is absorbing a large part of the savings of other countries instead of attributing to the flow of capital to the rest of the world.' It is our hope that during this session we shall make progress in building the basis for the redirection of capital investment flows towards developing countries in the years ahead.
The debt problem which emerged in almost all developing countries in the early 1980s has now proliferated and become a persistent crisis, halting growth, disrupting social order and increasing the threat to political stability in many developing countries. In spite of endless and strenuous adjustment efforts and debt rescheduling, the prevailing international financial and monetary system has made it virtually impossible for the affected developing countries to cope with the burden. Such decisions as those of the Toronto summit have made little or no impact and need to be strengthened.
Massive net financial resource transfer from the capital-importing developing countries to developed countries has deteriorated, increasing to more than $32 billion in 1988 as compared to a previous annual range of from $20 billion to $25 billion. This has added to the burden of building the needed basic infrastructure set-up, particularly in Africa, to increase the productivity of their economies, including the capabilities for dealing with the harsh external environmental shocks. It is our hope that efforts to deal with these negative transfers will be strengthened.
The problems of debt and net transfer of resources from developing countries to developed countries are tightly linked to the problem facing developing countries in the field of international trade. The most viable and effective strategy to debt solution and revitalizing sustainable growth in developing countries must provide for increased export earnings for developing countries as an important component. Yet the trend in the multilateral trading system is towards increased strains. The ongoing multilateral trade negotiations provide an important opportunity to reverse this trend and to strengthen the system.
The initiative taken by the Group of 77 in calling for a special session of the General Assembly devoted entirely to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of the economies of developing countries, was indeed timely, It will provide an important opportunity for arriving at a consensus on development. Simultaneously, the elaboration and establishment of a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade should provide measures for securing an improved international economic environment to support the efforts of developing countries.
Africa has faced the most prolonged and serious economic crisis in history. As the Survey clearly and correctly points out:
'Africa's economies remain highly vulnerable to circumstances that are largely beyond their control'. (World Economic Survey 1989, E/I989/45, p. 29) The external constraints on Africa's recovery have become more binding. Africa's external debt rose from $220.1 billion in 1987 to $210 billion in 1988. The scheduled debt ratio now amounts to about 40 per cent of export earnings. Overall commodity prices fell by nearly 13 per cent in 1988 while import prices continued to rise. Today Africa is a net exporter of financial resources while new loans are out of reach and tied to rigorous adjustment policy requirements. African economies are dominated by primary goods-producing sectors and characterized by small manufacturing sectors that are overly dependent on imported raw materials and intermediate goods, producing almost entirely for domestic use. Africa's debt-service obligations and stagnant export earnings restrict the imports that are necessary for the revival of investment and the utilization of existing agricultural and manufacturing capabilities. Urgent action is therefore required regarding the Secretary-General's suggestion in his report to this session on the work of the Organization that it is necessary to review the decisions of the Toronto summit aimed at alleviating the debt burden of low-income countries, especially African countries, where the results have so far been disappointing.
Finally, my delegation would like to add its concern to that already expressed by other delegations concerning the degradation of our environment. The
preservation and the protection of the sanctity of the environment should be the primary responsibility of all nations - big or small, developed or developing. North or South. We in Kenya have the singular honour of hosting the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Our own President, His Excellency Mr. Daniel arap Moi, has taken a decisive lead in preserving our common heritage, the wildlife, and protecting the environment. As he pointed out in his address to the opening session of the recent UNEP Governing Council:
'... environmental problems are human in origin and global in nature; their solution would therefore require both human intervention and global action and co-operation'.
The Committee for Development Planning has noted that environmental damage in affluent societies is a consequence of excessive development and unrestrained demands for even larger goods and services resulting in huge quantities of waste. On the other hand, in the developing countries the most fundamental environmental problems are a consequence of poverty with the ever-increasing struggle for food and energy resulting in the accelerated destruction of forests, the degradation of the soil and the depletion of water resources. Issues of economic development cannot therefore be separated from environmental issues. At our recent meeting in Caracas we, the Group of 77, devoted a lot of time to discussions on the contributions developing countries can make in global co-operation on the environment and development. These contributions, which among other things include the reaffirmation of our commitment to the strengthening of international co-operation for the protection of the environment, demonstrate the importance developing countries have attached to this issue. Kenya has taken significant steps to protect its arable land from soil erosion, by reforestation, reclaiming marginal land through the use of severely constrained financial resources and raising public awareness of the dangers involved, and mobilizing people through the spirit of self-help. We have also done our best to protect our regional marine environment. As the Secretary-General emphasized in his opening statement at the last session of the Economic and Social Council, while the challenges facing us are the responsibility of. all countries it is evident that the industrialized countries have the most to contribute not only in mitigating the damage which they are causing to the global environment but also in assisting developing countries. The deliberations during this session on a conference on environment and development present the industrialized countries with great and timely opportunities to demonstrate the political will that is so vital in laying the basis for a successful conference. It is our hope that such a conference will set in motion the desired momentum towards genuine international co-operation on the environment and sustainable development. When that conference comes let us make it an opportunity to assess what we shall have done between now and then to protect our environment rather than an assembly to lament our failure to protect our planet.
","However, until that time, we remain gravely concerned that, despite repeated calls for change, the racist Pretoria regime has continued to enforce its abhorrent system of apartheid and has continued to deny its black majority population its inalienable right to self-determination. But we remain hopeful that the improved relations and intensified bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers as highlighted here by President Bush on Monday will have a positive impact on the global disarmament efforts and lead to the easing of tension in the world as a whole. The initiative taken by the Group of 77 in calling for a special session of the General Assembly devoted entirely to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of the economies of developing countries, was indeed timely, It will provide an important opportunity for arriving at a consensus on development. Simultaneously, the elaboration and establishment of a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade should provide measures for securing an improved international economic environment to support the efforts of developing countries. Urgent action is therefore required regarding the Secretary-General's suggestion in his report to this session on the work of the Organization that it is necessary to review the decisions of the Toronto summit aimed at alleviating the debt burden of low-income countries, especially African countries, where the results have so far been disappointing."
44,1989,BLZ,"ï»¿We in Belize are keenly aware of the essential role the United Nations plays in advancing the cause of freedom, peace and justice throughout the world. Our struggle for political independence was rooted in our peoples' desire to be free, but it was nurtured and strengthened right here, in the corridors of the United Nations, by the overwhelming support we received from the international community.
It is not surprising, then, that the Constitution of Belize affirms principles of universality - principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God, faith in human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the dignity of the human person. Such principles translate into respect for the sovereignty of other nations, the right to self-determination of peoples, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his appointment to that high office. The world community looks to him - an accomplished son of Africa - with great expectancy and hope. We express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our deep appreciation and recognition of his tireless efforts in promoting peace and the noble objectives of our Organization.
This year, the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly opened in a spirit of optimism. The present atmosphere is one of reduced international tension. The ideological forces that have polarized the world for half a century are diminishing. We see a universal movement of people - people everywhere - in search of freedom and democratic participation.
It is a time of momentous change and transformation. There is a growing recognition of the imperative to manage the world's resources in the interests of the global family. While all this is taking place, issues like environmental degradation, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (ANDS) and drug abuse have joined the scourge of poverty as priority issues on the international agenda - doing so in ways that underline how interdependent nations and people have become. The achievements in the political sphere are in stark contrast to persistent economic problems facing many developing com tries. In the Latin American and Caribbean region, the massive debt problem, flight of capital, decline in trade and investment, and the growing disparity between the rich and the poor have resulted in many countries suffering reverses in the decade of the 19803.
Reducing poverty and revitalizing growth is the challenge of our time. As we begin the new decade, the task ahead is clear. The development agenda for the 1990s must be to harness growth and use resources creatively to improve the quality of life of all our people. If we are to achieve a high quality of growth and development, our Governments must make better use of the resources. This calls for sound public financial and fiscal responsibility. We must find better ways for public expenditure to complement and spur private production, not displace it and we must provide the essential social infrastructure in education, health and housing to benefit the many, not divert scarce resources to luxuries for a select, privileged few. We must bring the informal workers into the regular economy and allow individual enterprise to flourish.
But this will not happen by itself. There is need for concerted action in a new dynamic partnership where people elect Governments and Governments empower people to solve their own problems and take control of their lives. For this to happen, we must launch a new era in education to equip our young people with the knowledge, skills and attitudes they require to take an active role in the development process.
Such pragmatic efforts at the national level will, however, be frustrated if the international economic environment is not conducive to development. While we in the developing countries must carry the primary responsibility for our future, the industrialized world has a vital part to play - not just in providing external resources and the transfer of technology, but also in ensuring that the developing countries have easy access to their markets. 
The time has come to address the pressing imbalances in the world economy. We have repeatedly acknowledged that peace and development are inextricably bound. Indeed  it is true saying that development is another name for peace, or, as others have put it, that economic freedom and political freedom are essential and inseparable considerations on the read to national prosperity. The one will not long survive without the other.
Because of this vital connection between politics and economics in ' Id of global interdependence, the special session of the United Nations devoted to international economic co-operation to be convened in April 1990 takes on added importance. Of special concern is the growing trend in the industrialized world toward protectionism. The economic integration of Europe poses new realities for many of our countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific - the ACP Group. Cur economies are open and vulnerable not only to the ravages of hurricanes but also to the man-made disasters resulting from arbitrary decisions in the boardrooms of the industrialized world which distort the levels of commodity prices.
Such vulnerability and fragility make it all the more imperative that we put our own houses in order. We have tried to do that in Belize. Working in accordance with the process of democratic choice, the people of Belize, in the second national elections since our independence eight years ago, decided to replace its Government after one term in office. Belizeans arrived at a consensus to take charge once again of their political, social and economic future in a compassionate and productive atmosphere in which Belizeans come first, l ensure this, they elected to government a majority of the candidates of the People's United Party, the political movement that with the support of the people and the backing of the international community led Belize to independence in 1981. 
Independence brought with it the promise of development, of more opportunity, peace and stability. Good government delivers and makes possible the attainment by the people of a better standard of living and a higher quality of life. The dynamics of development impel us to give highest priority to that assurance of human dignity - the creation of jobs.
My Government, therefore, continues to welcome investors from abroad who, with their capital, technology and access to new markets can join Belizeans in expanding trade and providing increased export earnings and economic activity. Those investors are our partners in development, who will participate with Belizeans in the mixed economy, assuring jobs at decent wages while at the same time benefiting from the climate of free and fair competition of a socially just market economy.
In accordance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, it is heartening to note the current constructive efforts now under way aimed at achieving the peace that has eluded our region for so long. The present political climate now renders the military option obsolete in resolving the embittered tensions that for ages have remained a major obstacle to international peace and security.
The community of nations has reiterated deserved recognition of the far-sighted and unfailing determination of the Contadora process in its conviction that the peoples of Central America wish to achieve peace, reconciliation, development  id justice without interference, in accordance with their own decisions and historical experience.
The recent signing of the historic Tela agreement between five Central American Presidents is the latest example of the region's commitment to fulfilling the undertakings assumed under the Eequipulas procedure in search of a firm and lasting peace. That joint plan for the voluntary demobilization, repatriation or relocation of the Nicaraguan resistance is hailed as a singular achievement of the Central American peace process, which seeks national reconciliation and democratization.
Belize maintains its commitment to peaceful coexistence and harmony with all our neighbours. Over the past year Belize and Guatemala have continued the negotiating process aimed at the conclusion of a possible draft of a comprehensive treaty to afford a just and lasting determination of the controversy. We stand ready to resume these discussions with a renewed spirit of goodwill,, without compromising the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Belize.
The continued support of our sister Caribbean countries, the Commonwealth of Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as the solidarity and understanding of out Latin American neighbours, gives us confidence that the reality of our two sovereign nations living as good neighbours will find universal acceptance.
In a similar vein we applaud the announcement of the renewal of negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the Falkland Islands, recalling our own struggle, we exhort our Argentine friends to refrain from any action that might be prejudicial to the Interests of the Falklands or compromise their inalienable right to self-determination.
My Government continues to be seriously concerned at the erosion of the constitutional process and the denial to the people of Panama of their right freely to elect a Government of their choice. The decision of the military leadership to annul elections and subsequently impose a president of its own choosing as Head of State of Panama further isolates that country in the international community.
The friendship and co-operation between the peoples of Belize and Panama have a long history and it Is the wish of ray Government that this relationship should continue. We recall the solidarity demonstrated by Panama during Belize's struggle for independence and the pivotal role played by the late Panamian leader General Torrijos towards the achievement of Belizean independence.
We call on the current leadership in Panama to co-operate in national and regional efforts to establish the framework for a return to democracy and constitutional rule in Panama and to put in place mechanisms for early and fair elections.
The success of democracy is inevitable  as is now being proved in several parts of the world. We invite the leadership in Haiti to take certain steps on the path to democracy to demonstrate its commitment to early elections and transition to democratic rule and we ask all sectors of Haitian society to co-operate in this important process.
We now focus attention once more on the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. The magnitude of this global problem, in addition to its economic and social consequences, has now become a major national security concern for many nations in our region. At home in Belize we are committed to launching a concerted drive to eradicate the drug problem and to join forces in regional and international actions to put an end to this menace to society.
While the cultivation and use of marijuana in Belize have abated considerably, we recognize a new danger stemming from the growing use of crack and cocaine, as well as the use of our territory as a trans-shipment point for illegal drugs. In the face of these problems my Government proposes to work in collaboration with friendly Governments at the interdiction level to eliminate this serious threat to our country. We also recognize that if the use of illegal drugs in our society is to be eliminated  the problem must be addressed as an education issue as well. We will therefore shortly be launching a major campaign using all available resources in our educational system to focus national attention on the inherent dangers associated with the use of illicit drugs. We also plan to establish a drug rehabilitation centre and welcome international support in this endeavour.
We wish to record our support for the related proposal of our sister Caribbean Community (CARICCK) State of Jamaica, which calls for the establishment of a multinational anti-drug task force within the United Nations system. This is a welcome opportunity for countries to pool their resources and intelligence capabilities against the well-organized, well-financed, and better-equipped drug cartels. And we can do so without infringing on the sovereignty of any nation.
Despite some progress and relaxation of political tensions in conflicts on the continent, the minority white racist Pretoria regime continues its intransigence, oppressing and exploiting the already dispossessed black majority in South Africa. The apartheid policy of this terrorist settler rule administration remains today as the glaring obstacle in the path of peace, stability and development in that region. Belize does not entertain notions that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, can be reformed. We insist on the total eradication of all vestiges of this system, which is an affront to any standard of human dignity. Belize continues to associate itself with those who are committed to keeping up the relentless pressure on South Africa until our brothers and sisters eventually triumph using all possible means in their just and legitimate struggle.
On Namibia, we trust that the Security Council will lend its full weight to ensuring that South Africa proceeds to disband all its paramilitary and commando units which still threaten the implementation of political progress towards Independence. Even at this late stage, the international community must remain vigilant to ensure that South Africa does not succeed in subverting the process towards democratic elections in Namibia.
Belize recognizes the urgency of achieving a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the core of which is the question of Palestine. No just and lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle East until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized, including their right to self-determination and a homeland, without compromising Israel's security. At a time when the Palestinian leadership under Chairman Yasser Arafat is offering important peace initiatives, my delegation looks forward to the early convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization and all parties on an equal footing.
In the case of Lebanon, it is our hope that the current cease-fire will be respected by all the parties concerned and that Lebanon will be given the opportunity to recover from the destruction and violence which has occurred. All Lebanon wants is to be left alone so that it can find Lebanese solutions to Lebanese problems. Outside interference can only hinder this.
The global issue which today holds centre stage is the environment. In the coming decade, the world must deal much more effectively with problems resulting from the degradation of the environment acid rain, ocean pollution, nuclear and toxic waste, ozone depletion and climate change. Industrial countries account for over 75 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions, the main cause of global warming. Clearly, therefore, the major responsibility to reduce emissions rests there.
Belize has its own concerns our rain forests, our coral reef system and our flora and fauna are gifts of God which we have a duty to protect for generations of Belizeans yet unborn. We are committed to protecting Belize's natural resources and environment to maintain a harmonious ecological balance, but we must take a holistic approach to the environmental challenge. We must promote and protect the environmental qualities of life in the fullest sense by extending economic choice and opportunities, for poverty is the ultimate environmental degradation. A fundamental environmental task for the decade ahead is the promotion of sustainable agriculture to feed our people. We must meet the growing environmental challenge by expanding economic freedom. True and lasting economic development must necessarily include maintaining ecological balance.
Our societies in the third world are undergoing serious strains in the care of children and in guaranteeing women equal opportunities in education and employment. Our ability as a people to provide the values and ideals that will guide the next generation will determine the course of social realities in the twenty-first century. As a policy, the Government of Belize supports public and private initiatives in the promotion and defence of human rights, and particularly 
the rights of the child and of women. As soon as it is practicable, Belize will accede to and ratify the convention on the rights of the child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, end give practical effect to them by force of law.
All this requires action new. The future is now. We can promote political freedom if we also promote economic freedom. We can aim for a high quality of growth while at the same time providing for the equitable distribution of the fruits of growth. We can achieve greater productivity and expanded trade if we liberate the creative energies of out people and remove the barriers to an interdependent global economy. If we do act effectively together, we may be able to look back on this time as a turning point in building a more peaceful and just world - a new world, a far better world - one in which the eternal dignity of man is respected. 
","We must find better ways for public expenditure to complement and spur private production, not displace it and we must provide the essential social infrastructure in education, health and housing to benefit the many, not divert scarce resources to luxuries for a select, privileged few.

44,1989,FRA,"ï»¿I am speaking on behalf of the European Economic Community. Mr. President, allow me in my turn to extend to you on behalf of the European Community and its member States warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the office of President of the General Assembly. Your experience in international affairs, your perfect familiarity with the United Nations system and your personal qualities particularly qualify you to occupy that important office. We have no doubt that those attributes will enable you to work wonders.
Let me also include in this tribute your predecessor at the head of the Assembly, Mr. Dante Caputo. The energy and efficiency with which he discharged that office merit the gratitude of the entire Organization.
I should like also, on behalf of the Twelve, to assure the Secretary-General of our unswerving and unqualified support in his weighty task, and to express our admiration for his untiring activity throughout the world in favour of peace.
The European Community and its member States have always considered that they have a special contribution to make to the efforts being made to build a more just and peaceful world bound by ever-closer ties of solidarity.
I should now like to put forward a few thoughts about the main thrust of our external action, by pointing to our common struggle for peace, the outlook for economic development and the fight against the scourges inflicted on our societies by human rights violations, terrorism and drug abuse.
I should like first to say a few words about the hopes that have been kindled by developments in the year gone by. while the progress made is still too fragile for the international community to be certain that it will soon see the dawn of peace break upon the world, and while tensions still exist or are worsening here and there and indeed new conflicts are emerging, the fact is that, all in all, the cause of peace has advanced more than it probably ever has done in recent times.
In relations between the eastern and western parts of Europe, recent developments suggest that the deep wounds of history, once considered as incurable, are now beginning to heal. On both sides, a common language is enabling us to talk to one another, negotiate and reach agreements that only a short time ago seemed beyond our grasp.
The European Council has sought to give fresh impetus to East-West relations, as this is warranted by the changes towards greater political and economic freedom that have taken place in the Soviet Union and several Central and Eastern European countries, notably Poland and Hungary. While we must regret that there remain serious violations of human rights in some of those countries, how could we fail to welcome the reforms on which they have embarked and support and encourage them when they are quite plainly contributing to overcoming the divisions of the last War at a pace and on a scale hitherto unprecedented in Europe.
The proceedings of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe are closely bound up with that prospect. Since the adoption of a closing document last January in Vienna, two key meetings - the Information Forum in London and the first session of the Conference on the Human Dimension in Paris - have made it possible to take greater advantage of the scope of the Helsinki process to advance the cause of fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the values of democracy.
As for the negotiations on measures aimed at building confidence and security and on conventional forces in Europe, whose purpose is to remove the imbalances liable to undermine the stability and security of the continent, they have taken a decisive turn, and there are hopes that in the coming months significant progress can be made which would have major importance for the future of East-West relations.
In the broader setting of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, there have been encouraging results following the impetus created by the Conference on chemical disarmament held in Paris in January 1989. The Twelve would like to see the conclusion at the earliest possible opportunity of a comprehensive, verifiable treaty banning chemical weapons. The results achieved in that field at the recent United States-Soviet meetings are a most encouraging sign in this respect.
By the same token, I welcome the progress announced yesterday by the President of the United states and moments ago by the Soviet Foreign Minister with regard to their bilateral negotiations on reducing by half their stockpiles of strategic weapons. We hope there will be an early outcome to these negotiations and that the significant gains of the past, such as the anti-ballistic missile Treaty, will be preserved.
But Europe is not the only theatre in the struggle for peace, to which our Organization attaches universal significance. Encouraging signs have emerged in many parts of the world, holding out promise of the settlement of some conflicts. The utmost must be done to give added impetus to those favourable develops, and the Twelve are setting about that task.
In Namibia, the process towards independence and peace is under way. The twelve unreservedly support the action of the Secretary-General and earnestly call on all the parties not to impede the movement towards peace. The European community stands ready to welcome an independent Namibia among its partners under the Lome Convention.
The rewarding dialogue started with the front-line States, notably in Luxembourg last June, shows that everyone aspires to an early settlement of these long-standing conflicts which have delayed or thwarted the region's development plans. Here again, the Community is more than ready to foster reconstruction and, whether it be in Angola, Mozambique or elsewhere, to help the population build a new era of peace. 
In that connection, the Community and its member States have always insisted on the need to put an end to the apartheid system and bring about the establishment of a just, democratic society in South Africa. I shall come back to that basic demand.
The Twelve are particularly attentive to the implementation of the Secretary-General's peace plan for Western Sahara, which is expected to lead to a referendum on self-determination and holds out hopes for a settlement of this issue. They are convinced that the creation of the Arab Maghreb Union will contribute to that end.
Through the recent Tela agreements, the countries of Central America have demonstrated their determination to take their destiny in their own hands. This is a source of satisfaction to us. The success of the exercise will depend on the different parties abiding by the undertakings they have given. It is also envisaged that the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) will lend their support to the implementation of the peace agreements.
The Community and its member States wish to pay a tribute to the sense of moderation and dialogue displayed by the Central American Heads of State, moved as they have been by the spirit of democracy. The San Pedro Sula Conference, held in February 1989, showed the determination of the European Community and the Contadora group of countries to give their support to the process of negotiation and economic integration which the Central American Governments have set as their goals.
The Twelve also note with satisfaction the progress made by democracy in South
America, and especially the prospect of positive developments in Chile, heralded by free elections.
Since the announcement of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, which was welcomed by the entire international community, the Secretary-General has, with the Twelve's support, pursued his endeavours to ensure that the negotiations move progressively towards a final settlement. But we should not be content with the current 'no war - no peace' situation. The Twelve accordingly wish to launch an appeal to the Governments of the two countries to contribute to the efforts of the
Secretary-General and his colleagues to transform the present armistice into a lasting peace and to lose no more time in fully implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1987).
The Twelve express the hope that the Iranian leaders will demonstrate their readiness to contribute to international life in a constructive and peaceful manner consonant with the norms governing relations among States, so that that country can again take its rightful place in its region and in the international community at large.
The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan was a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a political solution. As long as the conflict continues, there will still be a need for all the Afghan parties to seek ways and means of bringing about a genuine process of self-determination, leading to the formation of a fully representative government and the existence of a truly independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. The Twelve confirm their support for the United Nations Secretary-General in the efforts he is making to facilitate a settlement, in the hope that the refugees will be able to return to their homes in freedom and dignity, the Community and its member States stand ready, once a settlement has been reached, to contribute to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, in the same way as they are already contributing to the humanitarian assistance being provided for the long-suffering people of that country.
In Cambodia, signs have emerged in recent months, albeit tentatively, of a possible return to peace. The Twelve have welcomed the decision of Viet Nam to withdraw its troops and consider that their withdrawal has made it possible to seek an overall political solution to the Cambodian conflict. The Twelve's support could not but encourage France to take the initiative of convening an international conference in Paris, with the co-presidency of Indonesia, bringing together all the 
Khmer parties and the countries most directly involved, in the presence of the UN Secretary General. Although the meeting did not make it possible to reach an agreement, it can be said to have marked a very important turning point in the search for a peaceful solution. The process which has now started should be pursued, with the requisite determination, with the aim of arriving at least at an overall settlement guaranteeing the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia and enabling the Cambodian people to control its own destiny through free end internationally supervised elections. The temptation of the different parties involved to seek a solution in the field still by force of arms could lead only to a stalemate.
The Twelve are convinced that the only way out of this long-drawn-out conflict lies in dialogue and national reconciliation. The continuing instability in that region is also adding to the tragedy of the Vietnamese boat people. The Twelve share the determination of the Secretary-General and the international community to find a solution to this problem. In the case of the Korean peninsula. we should like again to voice the hope that, in accordance with the principle of universality enshrined in our Organization, the Korean people may enjoy full representation in the United Nations at an early date.
The progress that has been accomplished and the stronger conviction we now have that peace is possible everywhere can only strengthen our resolve to work the Middle East. In the Middle East at a time when, on the Palestinian  side, a number of important decisions have opened up fresh prospects for a realistic search for a settlement of the Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question, no real progress has yet been made in responding to those moves. Yet the passage of time is not working to anybody's advantage. Let us beware of the disappointment that is bound to be aroused by such missed opportunities.
The Community is making the same message plain to one and all: if a peace settlement is to be reached, then it is necessary to recognize, both in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, the right of all States, and of Israel in particular, to security and the right of all peoples to justice - in other words, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, with everything which that implies. In the Community's view, the appropriate way to attain those goals remains the organization of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations.
The situation in the occupied territories provides a dramatic illustration of the effects of the lack of progress in seeking a settlement. The measures taken against the population in those territories - the continued closure of the universities, the expulsions, the extension and increase in the number of detentions on administrative grounds - have prompted the Twelve to appeal yet again to the Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations as the occupying Power, in accordance with the Security Council resolutions.
The Twelve, in the Madrid Declaration, have made their position known on the Israeli plan for organizing elections and granting provisional self-governing status to the territories. For the impact of such elections to be really meaningful, they should form part of a comprehensive settlement process based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the application of the principle of land for peace, and they should be held with adequate guarantees of freedom throughout the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem. In the same spirit and on the basis of the same principles, the Twelve welcome Egypt's contribution to the peace process, as set out in the 10 Points  which President Mubarak has Put forward. The Twelve hope that this will
make it possible, in particular, to set in motion the necessary dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.
Without waiting for the settlement which, they so earnestly desire, the Community and its member states plan to step up their cooperation with the occupied territories and to develop their program of assistance to the population, which has suffered so severely from the continuing occupation and its attendant restrictions. 
I now  wish to refer to Lebanon. In Lebanon, the tragedy of a nation that has been torn apart has lasted for 14 years now. Never has the suffering been so great as over the past few months, nor the battles so bloody, nor the ordeals borne by everybody so horrendous.
It is this that has prompted the Community and its Member States to call for an effective cease-fire and the lifting of the blockades and for a start to be made towards a process of national reconciliation ensuring the full restoration of Lebanese sovereignty on the basis of fresh institutions. They have constantly given their support to the moves made by the Arab League, which were initially led by the Committee of Six and subsequently by that of the three Heads of State. They welcome that top-level Committee's resumption of its mission, which they fully support, and hope that once the parties have all agreed to its proposals, dialogue and the quest for peace will prevail.
It is now essential that, at a moment when dialogue is being renewed, all Lebanese parties be freed from external pressures so that they may be able to agree on a new system for living side by side, one that takes into account the existing demographic and social situation. Through the introduction of such a system and the withdrawal of all foreign forces - with the exception of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) - Lebanon must regain its full sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. 
This is what France has been endeavouring to do, and will continue to do with the support of its partners in the Community, while making it its constant concern to support the Arab moves led by the Tripartite Committee until hope is rekindled in Lebanon.
At the same time the Community and its member States have signified their solidarity with the entire Lebanese people by undertaking an assistance programme aimed at alleviating their suffering and at contributing to the restoration of normal living conditions and the resumption of economic and social activities.
We cannot speak of Lebanon without referring to the fate of the hostages, several of whom are nationals of the Community's member States. How can we forget Colonel Higgins, who was serving the United Nations? The Twelve condemn the taking of hostages, which must be fought with all the means at our disposal in the spirit of the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council. The Twelve wish to appeal to those countries which might be able to exert some influence in secure the liberation of the hostages.
I should like to state the Community's unchanging position with regard to Cyprus, a member of the European family. The Twelve call on all the parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General and his Representative on the spot with a view to overcoming the existing obstacles and finding the paths to dialogue. The Twelve ask them not to let slip the opportunity now available for a just and lasting settlement that will safeguard the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
We all know that world peace is a sacred cause. It warrants all the energy and resolve we can devote to it. It calls for determination and obstinacy. We may. no doubt, feel rather discouraged when no sooner has one hotbed of tension died down than others flare up, for we are then dogged by feelings of hopelessness, like those which Sisyphus may be felt at the top of his mountain before the stone started to roll down again.
And yet, hope remains alive when the chain of men and women epitomized by our Assembly are still linked together in the service of peace. We know that that unremitting task is a collective one and that progress cannot be made unless we are all mobilized.
Hence it is with the same determination, the same degree of hope and the same trust in good fortune that we have to tackle other conflicts and other areas of tension, evidence of further rifts here and there.
I should here like to turn to the case of those two countries, Senegal and Mauritania, which were living in harmony and united by a common design, but which have suddenly been rocked by violence to the point where they have now become brother enemies. Can Senegal and Mauritania soon return to the path of understanding and dialogue? The Twelve earnestly hope so. This is why they are supporting the mediation efforts of President Mubarak and hope that conciliation and reason will prevail.
Other tragedies are being played out. In Ethiopia, where the civil war continues to rage bringing in its wake a host of displaced populations, suffering and poverty, prospects for dialogue seem nevertheless to be emerging. The Twelve hope to do all they can to pave the way for negotiation and reconciliation. The same holds true for the Sudan and Somalia.
In this connexion I should like to pay a tribute to the action of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), whose work everyone considers irreplaceable.
Lastly, I should like to mention the hopes aroused by the discussions between the Governments at Colombo and New Delhi in a bid to restore peace and national unity in Sri Lanka. 
In the case of East Timor, the Twelve reaffirm their support for the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General. They hope that early progress will lead to a just and comprehensive settlement, accepted internationally.
The cause of peace is making progress in spite of everything, as we can see, and our Assembly bears special witness to the fact. It is making progress through multilateral and bilateral dialogue, through the readiness of States to renounce war in settling their differences, and through the action of the United Nations in every instance where its mediation is imperative. The Twelve intend to associate themselves fully with this ever renewed task and they will play a major role in quelling conflicts, by reasons, I would say, of their very nature and calling, and through the example they are setting through the agreement among them and their prospective union.
Yet peace-making, the reduction of tensions and the banishment of violence cannot be dissociated from the struggle against the inequalities marking international economic development. We must take care - I say again - not to provoke new trouble spots that might be stirred up by the revolt of the poor. We must make sure that growth world-wide is shared more fairly and is more balanced and more geared to coping with the abject poverty of those countries which have few natural endowments or which have been ill-treated by history or crushed by the burden of debt. Action in favour of growth and development is, more than ever, an integral part of the struggle for peace. The Community has made that fact a key feature of its relations with the rest of the world.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, economic growth has recovered and has brought about a sharp increase in trade. Our aim is to consolidate that trend while at the same time continuing the struggle against inflation and unemployment. We have to ensure that everybody benefits from the movement. The fact that whole regions, in particular in Africa and Latin America, are continuing to lag behind
would reduce all efforts to naught if priority were not given to North-South solidarity.
As the world's foremost trading power and its leading provider of aid, the European Community considers that tangible steps have to be taken in the three key areas of international economic co-operation, development and the environment, about which I shall now say a few words.
In recent years Europe, together with Japan and a number of other Asian partners, has progressively taken over the momentum formerly generated by growth in the United States. Such growth is healthy and is the outcome of efforts of investment and modernization and the determined and convergent action of member States to hold down inflation and, above all, to finalize the establishment of the internal market by 1993.
This internal market will not be self-contained. The Europe of 1993 will be a 'Europe of partners'. The programme for finalizing the creation of the internal market will not entail any weakening of the Community's international obligations. All its multilateral or bilateral commitments are and will be respected. It is in our very interest to preserve and encourage a free and open trading system.
All Europe's partners will benefit from the single market of 1993 as a result of the dismantling of frontiers, the improvement of access procedures and the greater degree of transparency. The economic growth generated by the merger of 12 markets into a single market of 320 million consumers will work to the advantage of everybody when it is borne in mind that imports, which already account for one quarter of its gross domestic product, are expected to progress even further.
In more specific areas, the efforts deployed by the Community at the internal level will also have positive effects for third countries. For instance, the progressive accomplishment of economic and monetary union - which will be one of our major priorities in the coming months - will be instrumental in contributing to the stability of the international monetary system.
The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, on which work started five years ago, is continuing, it is contributing to the improvement of the world market situation. The Co-unity reaffirms the undertakings it gave at the mid-term meeting of the Uruguay Round negotiations in April 1989. The efforts it is making
are considerable, and I would recall that it remains the world's largest importer of agricultural products.
In 1989 the Community has continued to strengthen its relations with all the regions of the world. First, it is making preparations with the European Free Trade Association for a renewed framework for dialogue and co-operation. Then, a series of agreements have been concluded with the countries of Eastern Europe: with Hungary, Czechoslovakia and, even more recently, with Poland, to which Commissioner Adriessen and myself paid a visit. Developments in this last-named country make it increasingly urgent to dispatch the aid that was decided on at the Summit of the Arch and accepted by 24 countries. We must force the pace to respond to the extent of the need.
Negotiations are being conducted with the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, and are being envisaged with the German Democratic Republic. This is the basis on which the Community plans to engage in a variety of forms of co-operation to supplement that in which its member States are already engaging.
The creation of the Arab Maghreb Union will enable the European Economic to step up and diversify the already very rewarding relations it maintains with those Mediterranean countries. Discussions are proceeding with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council for the purpose of supplementing the Cooperation Agreed signed in 1988 by means Of a fresh trade agreement.
In Asia, 1989 has been a year marked by new joint steps taken by the EEC and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN, in their bid to further industrial cooperation by stepping up investments. With its Latin American partners, the Community is pursuing its efforts to diversify cooperation and trade. in Central America, it is developing it cooperation under the San Jose Agreements, thereby enhancing the efforts being made by the countries of the isthmus.
Lastly, I should like to express my deep satisfaction at the improvement in the Community's trade relations with its main partners in the developed world, where willingness to negotiate is now the overriding consideration.
This improvement in the climate is fragile, and our best chance of consolidating it is to complete the Uruguay Round negotiations by the date scheduled and to secure substantive results in all areas.
In the coming months, North-South solidarity will be in the international headlines: the renewal of the lome Convention, the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on economic cooperation and development, the second international conference on the least developed countries in Paris, and the launching of the fourth development decade.
Let us grasp the opportunity offered by these various occasions, for they will make it possible to take stock of what has been achieved and also to realize that we need to go further. Development depends to a large degree on the domestic strategies adopted by the countries concerned themselves. A large number of developing countries have embarked on a courageous adjustment process that is an essential requirement, even though it may sometimes give rise to problems from the social and political standpoints. I wish to pay tribute to their efforts which often demand heavy sacrifices.
However, these efforts will be useful only if they are made in a favourable international environment. In the first place, it is absolutely essential to lighten the burden of excessive indebtedness which has now become intolerable. In this crucial area, the concerted and constructive approach that has prevailed has already made it possible to overcome the inhibiting factors and to record some measure of progress.
Several of the Community's  member States have taken additional steps in favour of the poorest countries by cancelling official development assistance loans. France, for its part, has announced through the President of the Republic an across-the-board cancellation of the debts accruing from development assistance in the case of 35 of the poorest African entries. This measure will come into force on 1 January 1990 and is - I must say here - free of any conditions.
At the same time, other countries which are certainly not as poor but which are grappling with a heavy burden of indebtedness to the banks are having to face difficult political and economic choices. This is particularly the case in Latin America where solving the debt problem should make it possible to consolidate and strengthen democracy in the region. 
Two countries, Mexico and the Philippines, have already successfully embarked on that path. But progress in coping with indebtedness cannot be sufficient in itself to ensure development, and fresh resources are necessary. Such resources must, in the first instance, be generated by trade. The Community has already, to a large extent, opened up its market to products from the developing countries, without awaiting the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it has recently made significant improvements in the access of tropical products to its market.
In the ongoing renegotiation of the Lome Convention, it will endeavour to improve further an arrangement that is already proving advantageous. Even so, for the vast majority of the developing countries, dependent as they are on a handful of export comities, access to the markets of the industrialized countries is not enough. The Common Fund for commodities, should now come into force. For its part, the Community plans to strengthen the STABEX and SYSMIN mechanisms for the stabilization of export earnings under the Lome Convention.
Alongside these measures, official development assistance still represents a lifeline, and the Community is already making a considerable effort in that regard. The assistance proved by its member States taken together has been quite clearly moving in the direction of the 0.7 per cent target since the early 1980s.
In the final analysis, however, economic development hinges on an unfailing international mobilization of forces to protect our environment. The heating up of the atmosphere, the deterioration of the ozone layer, the pollution of the oceans and freshwater resources and desertification - all pose a threat to our entire planet.
Contending with this threat at an early date is a responsibility that is incumbent upon all of us.
Many developing countries do not always have sufficient funds for that purpose. An effort by the industrialized countries to introduce new forms of co-operation and financing will make it easier for the individual countries in the world to take care of the environment and to manage their natural resources in a common endeavour. This must surely be one of the most necessary forms that international solidarity can take.
Such solidarity is exemplary when it takes the form of protecting the tropical forests, helping Bangladesh to combat the incalculable consequences of flooding, or setting up an observatory in the Sahara.
The planetary scale of the threat is such that international negotiations are needed to spell out the objectives of common interest.
With that prospect in mind, the conference on the environment and development, which the United Nations Secretary-General is convening in 1992, will represent a major turning-point. Before then, the world climate conference which will take place in 1990 should afford an opportunity for making significant progress on the question of the greenhouse effect. The Community earnestly calls for the conclusion of an international agreement on climatic changes, and it would also like a dialogue to be started on ocean-bed mining. The Community has already taken, or is about to take, a number of decisions having immediate effects the early implementation, and at a faster pace, of the Helsinki decisions on the eradication of chlorofluorocarbons; the launching of a programme of action on the greenhouse effect; accession to the Basle Convention on movements of dangerous waste; the creation of a European environmental agency and the drawing-up of a tropical forest assistance programme.
These actions, coupled with support for the current international negotiations and with the integration of environmental issues into co-operation with the developing countries, are indicative of the Community's growing commitment to the preservation of our planetary environment.
There are other threats that also call for our vigilance and decisive action. We likewise cannot keep silent at the violations of mankind's most fundamental freedoms and rights. There are many such violations and they unfortunately continue to exist in too many countries on all the continents.
The Twelve are constantly waging war on behalf of human rights, which are the foundation of the United Nations, for they cannot remain indifferent to the intolerable violations to which those rights are being subjected. It is not that they are trying to behave as a censor, rather their fight is inspired by the values which underpin the Community and have brought its member States together.
The events of Tiananmen Square are still present in our memories, we may ask whether the European Community's relations with Beijing have been compromised for a long time to case. We sincerely hope that this will not be the case. We shall show vigilance, however, in the hope that the leaders of the People's Republic of China will eventually heed the appeals addressed to them by the entire international community. 
We also attach considerable importance to ensuring that China fully abides by the undertakings it has given in respect of the constitutional instruments for Hong Kong.
The Twelve wish to launch a further appeal for the Burmese people to be allied freely to exercise its right of expression.
Free elections have been held in Panama also. The Twelve are giving their support to the efforts of the Organization of American States to put forward a solution to the crisis, they reaffirm their reservations about the new regime currently in power, which does not enjoy any form of institutional legitimacy.
I turn now to South Africa - yet again. It has to be asked whether the winds of change bluing over southern Africa as a whole will also have a positive impact in South Africa. The Twelve, which have constantly denounced the particularly odious apartheid regime, have taken note of the statements made by the South African leaders asserting their determination to embark on reforms. However, the
twelve likewise note - and deplore - the extension of the state of emergency, the continuing ban on anti-apartheid organizations, the pursuit of repression and the continued detention of a large number of political prisoners, starting with Nelson Mandela. They will not let up the pressure until the aims being sought have been attained.
Violations of human rights are the blight of international relations, the leprosy of modern times. The Assembly has been witness to the emergence of the most admirable legal instruments and high-minded resolutions, which every State has accepted. How can one not speak here of the emotion of people who are suffering and whose hopes have been suddenly dashed in the face of brute force and the abuse of authority or merely a lack of understanding at man's relentless and courageous march towards freedom? I should like to pay tribute to the Commission on Human Rights, which is striving with all its might to win respect for the values enshrined in the United Nations. This year the Commission has submitted two particularly important drafts to the Assembly, after some years spent on the
difficult task of putting them together. These are the draft of the second optional protocol covering the abolition of the death penalty and the draft of a convention on the rights of the child. I hope that final consultations will permit the General Assembly to adopt these two drafts by consensus at this session.
Respect for freedom cannot be dissociated from the rejection of terrorism. Resorting to the barbaric practices of terrorism is unwarranted, whatever the circumstances. All terrorists have to be brought to justice. That means that every country must adopt a very firm attitude and that there has to be a concerted response.
With the early prospect of the creation of a Community area without internal borders, there is increased collaboration between the agencies responsible for public order in the Twelve, which consider that, as the threat stands at present, there are no grounds for relaxing their vigilance.
But there is another challenge to democratic values which cannot go un-mentioned: the scourge of drug abuse. The tragic events in Colombia last month, when the drug traffickers demonstrated their deadly power, have once again underscored the need to strengthen international cooperation in the fight against drugs. I wish to pay tribute to the authorities of Colombia for their coverage. The Community gives its full backing to them and to the measures taken by the President of the United States. Over and above the action being taken at the regional level, the Twelve consider that an effective solution to drug problems has to be sought in an international context involving producer countries, consumer countries and the countries of transit. It is with that in mind that the Twelve consider that the right forum for this purpose is the United Nations, with its Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control, and that they have contributed to the adoption of the new United Nations Convention against illicit drug trafficking, opened for signature on 20 December 1988.
The Community attaches the utmost importance to the work of the United Nations, as demonstrated by its very active participation in peace-keeping operations. That is why our first concern is to see the efficiency of the United  Nations enhanced and to learn about the initial results of the reforms undertaken for that purpose.
This is the first time that it has fallen to France, which is the current President of the Council of the European Communities, to speak in this capacity before the Assembly on behalf of the Europe of the Twelve. I am conscious of the honour that has been done to me. In France's eyes, the European Community is a very great undertaking whose scope it readily adopts as its own. I hope that the Community's identity will grow stronger as it increasingly opens to the world. Through its voice in international organizations and the presence and action of the 'troika' when urgent issues arise, the Community sends out a message of peace from its own people to the other peoples of the world. I am happy to have been able to speak on behalf of Europe.
Allow me, in conclusion, to say a few words on behalf of my own country. The ardent desire for peace, the aspiration for progress and the sacred defence of the law all represent, for every man and woman on our planet, the sum total of hope that no force on earth can ever stifle. That is the significance of the steps which France has taken in 1989, with the Conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons, action on human rights, action on behalf of Lebanon, and the Paris Conference on Cambodia. That is also why France has resolutely chosen, in the family of nations, to support the most impoverished and least favoured peoples. 
On the threshold of the year 2000, we are faced with and involved in fresh struggles. Let us wage them without beating around the bush and without asking futile questions. Future generations will judge us by the manner in which we have responded to the major challenges of the present, such as the threat to the environment, the crushing poverty of millions of human beings, and the violation of rights and freedoms. 
  The key word in response to all these problems is .is solidarity. It is France's fervent hope that voices will speak out in unison from this prestigious forum to enjoin the international community to give fresh impetus everywhere to dialogue, development and peace.
","I should now like to put forward a few thoughts about the main thrust of our external action, by pointing to our common struggle for peace, the outlook for economic development and the fight against the scourges inflicted on our societies by human rights violations, terrorism and drug abuse. The Twelve express the hope that the Iranian leaders will demonstrate their readiness to contribute to international life in a constructive and peaceful manner consonant with the norms governing relations among States, so that that country can again take its rightful place in its region and in the international community at large. The Twelve confirm their support for the United Nations Secretary-General in the efforts he is making to facilitate a settlement, in the hope that the refugees will be able to return to their homes in freedom and dignity, the Community and its member States stand ready, once a settlement has been reached, to contribute to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, in the same way as they are already contributing to the humanitarian assistance being provided for the long-suffering people of that country. The Community is making the same message plain to one and all: if a peace settlement is to be reached, then it is necessary to recognize, both in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, the right of all States, and of Israel in particular, to security and the right of all peoples to justice - in other words, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, with everything which that implies. Lastly, I should like to express my deep satisfaction at the improvement in the Community's trade relations with its main partners in the developed world, where willingness to negotiate is now the overriding consideration."

The Mali delegation, which I have the honour to lead, extends its warmest congratulations to Ambassador Garba on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session. His election honours all of Africa, and we are all the more pleased since his country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, maintains excellent relations of friendship and co-operation with the Republic of Mali. My delegation is convinced that his personal qualities and his rich diplomatic experience, which have won him the confidence of the General Assembly, guarantee that our work will be successful.
I take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the effective and wise way in which he directed the work of the forty-third session. I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his constant efforts to realize the ideals of the United Nations. The fruitful co-operation that existed during the term in office that President Moussa Traore has just ended at the head of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) enabled us to appreciate his great devotion to the cause of peace and co-operation between peoples. I extend to him the sincere thanks of the Republic of Mali for his constant understanding and willingness to help in the quest for solutions to African problems.
Since the last session the international political situation has continued to develop favourably, and there has been a political relaxation in the relations between the two major Powers. However, for the nations that constitute the third world there remain many uncertainties and subjects of concern which form an obstacle to a positive evolution of the world climate and provide challenges to be met. They include natural disasters; economic and financial constraints and the debt crisis  unsuitable remedies put forward by international financial and  monetary institutions the persistence of the apartheid regime and of the grave situation in the Middle East and the intifadah and many hotbeds of tension that continue in many parts of the world in spite of the increasingly expressed resolve to eliminate them. In a few weeks there will be a self-determination referendum in Namibia that will set the Namibian people on the noble and lofty course of independence and freedom.
Being well aware of the strategy of the Pretoria racists, which is constantly to resort to delaying tactics, the Organization of African Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have deplored the reduction in the numbers of those making up the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, because they know the real dangers of such reductions.
Our fears have been confirmed by the massacres of Namibian fighters that darkened the initial days of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the recent assassination of Anton Åubowski, the incorporation into the South African security forces in Namibia of elements of the Koevoet, which is a veritable death squad, and the intimidation of Namibians by the South African security forces - in a word, by all the sordid plots hatched by the Pretoria racists.
The intentions of the Pretoria racists always remain the same: to perpetuate their colonial domination in Namibia and to establish in the Territory a Government that does their bidding. In the past the goal was to destroy the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the authentic representative of the Namibian people  today it is to prevent, by all sorts of fraudulent manoeuvres, SWAPO's winning the elections.
In this context, we urge the Security Council to take the appropriate measures to control the situation in Namibia effectively and completely, in order to ensure that the independence process proceeds correctly. In that regard, we welcome the recent measures taken by the Security Council to increase the number of police officers attached to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.
In any event, the November elections must result in genuine independence for Namibia. A perverted independence and a failed decolonisation would betray all the sacrifices made by the heroic Namibian people and the commendable efforts of the international community to assert the inalienable rights of peoples and to protect international peace and security.
In South Africa itself, the lot of the black majority has not improved since our last session. The black population is still denied its most basic rights. The state of emergency is still in force, despite the repeated appeals of the international community. Arrests, arbitrary judgements and summary executions continue at a frenzied pace.
The Pretoria racists must yield to the evidence that repression, however fierce, will never succeed in stifling a people's aspirations to freedom nor in overcoming their desire for liberation. The continuation of the people's revolt, which is broadening in South Africa, in spite of violent repression, bears eloquent witness to that.
What is needed in South Africa is the establishment of a democratic, multiracial and egalitarian regime, installed by free elections. For that to be achieved, it is essential that the state of emergency be lifted, that Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners be unconditionally freed, that discriminatory laws be repealed and that all South Africans, without distinction as to race, enjoy the right to vote.
The Declaration on South Africa adopted by the ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Southern Africa in Harare on 21 August should be the basis of any negotiations to that end. Much is being said about changes that have occurred in the leadership of the political party in power in South Africa and about the new spirit of openness of the new President and of his desire for a change in policy in South Africa. We do not harbour any illusions: apartheid cannot be tolerated it must be totally dismantled and it is only if actions by the new leaders of the racist regime of South Africa ate taken along this path that we will appreciate them.
My country is convinced that the international community roust remain vigilant in view of the manoeuvres of the racist regime of Pretoria, and at the special session of the General Assembly on the policy of apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa, planned for next December, we shall express our complete solidarity with the valiant people of South Africa.
In Angola, we are pleased with the establishment of dialogue between the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA, a dialogue we fervently hope will lead to genuine peace in that country. We therefore urge all patties to abide by the Gbadoli agreements and take specific steps in keeping with the aspirations of the Angolan people to unity, peace and social and economic development.
In Western Sahara, the joint efforts of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General have led to the development of a settlement plan for this question in accordance with resolutions 104 (XIK) of the OAU and 40/50 of the General Assembly. Acceptance of the plan in August 1988 by the two parties - the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front - is an important step in the process towards the organization of a free and general referendum on self-determination. It is true that obstacles remain, but the establishment last June of the Technical Commission for the Implementation of the Plan will certainly make it possible to overcome them. Aware of the seriousness of the situation, my delegation urges the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLE ARIO to embark on a dialogue with a view to a just and definitive solution to that painful conflict. As a country of the region, the Republic of Mali, will continue, as in the past, to work towards a settlement of the conflict.
In another area, there have been positive developments in the Chad-Libya conflict since July 1989, thanks to the summit meeting held at the initiative of the Head of State of Mali, General Moussa Traore, which convened in Bamako his peers from Algeria, Gabon, Nigeria, Libya and Chad. The signing of a framework agreement between the two countries on 31 August in Algiers offers good prospects for a definitive solution to that dispute.
In the Middle East, the Palestinian people is still waging its heroic struggle to recover its- national rights. The most heroic expression of that struggle is the intifadah - that revolt of the people in the occupied territories which has mobilized Palestinians into the streets, including a large number of women and children, who are standing up unarmed to the Israeli occupation forces which, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949, ate committing acts of torture and carrying out massacres. The current generation of stone throwers is a new category of martyrs of the Palestinian people whose sacrifice invites the international community to undertake firm and resolute action to compel Israel to recognize the inalienable national rights of that people.
My delegation is convinced that the problem of the Middle East, at the core of which is the question of Palestine, requires a comprehensive settlement. In this regard it supports the idea of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of  the five permanent members of the Security Council and of all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, on an equal footing.
The persistent upheaval in Lebanon and the present tragedy of the Lebanese people are direct consequences of the Middle East problem. The Malian people deplore these tragic events. We appeal to the international community at large to do more to restore peace to that country, by preserving its independence and its territorial integrity, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and the deployment of the United Nations Interim force in Lebanon. My delegation supports and encourages the mediation efforts now being made by the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League to find a solution to that tragedy.
In agreeing to observe a cease-fire, Iran-Iraq have contributed to restoring calm to the Gulf region, thus facilitating the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to resolving that fratricidal conflict.
In Afghanistan, General Assembly resolution 43/20 welcomed with satisfaction the signing of the Geneva Agreements on 14 April 1988, an important step towards a definitive settlement of the conflict. In spite of the withdrawal of Soviet troops, calm has not been restored in Afghanistan. The 1988 Agreements are in jeopardy the United Nations good offices mission in Afghanistan and in Pakistan is not enjoying the desired co-operation. It is therefore up to the parties concerned, as well as the United States and the Soviet Union, which are the guarantors of these Agreements, to co-operate with the United Nations in order to make it possible to arrive at a negotiated settlement. In connection with South-East Asia, the informal meetings between the parties to the struggle in Kampuchea, known as the Jakarta Pounds, and the recent international peace conference on Cambodia in Paris have harmonized the positions of the parties with a view to a negotiated settlement of the Cambodian question without any foreign interference.
In the Korean peninsula, the resumption of talks will undoubtedly contribute to the peaceful settlement of the question, lb that end, we support the efforts made by the Korean people towards peaceful reunification through a North-South dialogue, without interference and in accordance with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and general national unity, as contained in the joint North-South declaration of 4 July 1972. My delegation is convinced that a reunified and strong Korea could legitimately be represented in the United Nations. We therefore urge all parties to work actively toward the attainment of the peaceful reunification of Korea prior to its admission to the United Nations. 
My delegation is pleased at the positive evolution of the political situation in Central America, which leads to hope for peace in the region. We also highly appreciate the political will demonstrated by the Heads of State of Central America to give effect to Security Council resolution 637 (1989), adopted on 27 July 1989. In this respect, the summit meeting in Honduras in August was significant and the agreements signed on that occasion will contribute to strengthening peace and security in the region.
The settlement of regional conflicts undoubtedly contributes significantly to the safeguarding of international peace and security, but the basic prerequisite for the establishment of lasting peace in the world remains general and complete disarmament, to the benefit of social and economic development for all mankind.
The arms race conducted by the two blocs in addition to being a permanent threat to the survival of the human race absorbs substantial resources. It might be sand that mankind is made to produce the means of its own destruction.
According to reliable sources, the intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles which were the subject of an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987 represent only about 4 per cent of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons. That is certainly not a great deal. None the less, it is appropriate to welcome that initiative, which we hope will mark the beginning of a process whose goal is general and complete disarmament and the allocation of the resources thus released to development action. The world cannot continue to spend many hundreds of billions of dollars on the arms race while a tiny fraction of that sum could help to eliminate poverty from out planet. In other words, disarmament should mean not only the reduction of arras and armed forces, but also the reduction of the sums spent on them. The international community must also intensify its efforts to bring about the limitation  reduction and elimination of weapons in order to focus all its economic strength and its technological skill at the development of Member States and international co-operation among all the nations of the world. For as long as three quarters of mankind is confronting an acute development crisis we shall continue to insist on the c elation ship between disarmament and development.
The economic and social situation has not improved in most developing countries. The economies of the countries concerned, in particular the economies of the African countries, have experienced negative growth in real terms. With a foreign debt which amounts to some 3230 billion, Africa can have no successful economic recovery on development programme unless that debt burden is lightened.
In this connection we welcome the initiatives of certain developed countries in cancelling part of the debt of some African countries. Those realistic and constructive initiatives aimed at reducing the volume of debt ate certainly part of the search for a way out of the crisis, but they are not sufficient because they do not constitute a final solution to the problem of indebtedness. They must be strengthened by the relevant suggestions contained in the common African position on the debt crisis.
A definitive settlement of Africa's foreign debt crisis requires energetic, bold decisions in the framework of a strategy based on co-operation, negotiation and shared responsibility. It was in order to give effect to such a strategy that Africa proposed to the international community the convening of an international conference on the African debt. It is clear that the debt crisis is hindering the development of Africa and constitutes the main factor impeding the recovery of economic growth. According to the Economic Commission for Africa, the overall economic growth of the continent averaged 1.4 per cent between 1986 and 1989 and population growth was approximately 3 per cent in that period. That means that per capita income in 1988 was 5 per cent lower than in 1985.
It is noteworthy that the agricultural sector, which constitutes the driving force of roost of Africa's economies, is in a state of serious stagnation, if not disquieting regression, because of the effects of climate disturbances and profound ecological deterioration, such as desertification, but also because of the brutal fall in the prices of agricultural commodities. The industrial sector, far from serving as a financial and material support for agriculture, absorbs an increasingly large share of the meagre resources available, to finance the necessary but very costly imports needed for production.
Because of this, African countries did not benefit from the economic recovery that occurred in the industrialized countries in 1988. The demand for and prices of commodities continued to decline at the same time. Furthermore, the foreign debt situation worsened and the flow of resources towards Africa decreased greatly, making the continent a net exporter of capital.
In addition to recovery programmes adopted by the continent to tackle the situation - for example, the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa, adopted in 1985, and the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, adopted in 1986 - over 30 African countries, among than my own, have undertaken, with the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, processes of stabilization and structural adjustment. The objective of the structural adjustment programmes is to restore in the short term the basic macro-economic balance. Those programmes have a negative impact on economic growth and on the standard of living of the population. In order to mitigate the shortcomings of those structural adjustment models, the 25th summit conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), held in Addis Ababa last July, adopted an African frame of reference for structural adjustment programmes that takes into account the long-term development objectives and strategies at the national, sub regional and regional levels.
My delegation hopes that the international community will grasp the relevance of the African formula and promote the adoption of those innovative and well-adapted principles in the approaches taken by international economic and financial institutions that play an essential role in preserving the economic health of the world. Africa is aware that it bears the primary responsibility for its own development. Accordingly, it has made all the sacrifices that the circumstances demand. Africa has committed itself to huge policies of economic reform which will have an impact on the economic and social sectors of public life. The most sensitive social sectors such as education and health, have already been affected greatly. The African States have agreed to accept the resulting political risks because they ate convinced that, at the end of the process  there will be an improvement in the standards of living of their peoples.
The struggle that we are waging today must certainly have as its goal the total development of the individual and harmony in society. It must guarantee social justice, equity and solidarity. In particular, it must lay the foundations that will ensure the survival and development of the child - that fragile sector of our population which is particularly vulnerable to the deterioration of economic conditions. This is why my country is making an urgent appeal to the international community for the prompt convening of a global summit on childhood. It would indeed be regrettable if the profound sacrifices made by the present generation. to assure for its successors a more human and move viable heritage were not to guarantee the survival, protection and development of the child. The adoption of an international convention on the rights of the child would make it possible to improve the conditions of children throughout the world, particularly in the developing countries.
An international conference on the environment will be held in Kali in a few months, with the support and participation of United Nations specialized agencies. The problem of the deterioration of the environment is multidimensional and is particularly difficult to resolve in our countries. Furthermore, the structural rigidity of underdeveloped economies compounds the many factors that cause the deterioration of our fragile ecosystems. By promoting development that is ecologically rational, the United Nations system and the entire international community are demonstrating a commendable awareness of the grave danger that human needs and the vicissitudes of climate pose to the ecological balance of our world. The logical consequence of this awareness is that any approach to ecologically rational development must deal with the disturbing problem of toxic waste. At the Basle Conference Africa shared its own concerns and expressed reservations about codifying transport or movement of toxic wastes. The international community cannot remain indifferent to this allâimportant question that faces the continent, already so deeply affected by the fragility of its ecosystem and the destructive effects of the global economic crisis.
In conclusion, may I say that it is comforting and encouraging to note that at the dawn of the third millennium the world is experiencing profound changes. However, these changes can be meaningful only if they are accompanied by a collective awareness of the shared destiny of everyone of the planet. The value of these changes depends on the establishment of a new, more just, more equitable and more democratic political, economic, social and cultural order in the world. By meeting the great challenges, by remaining united, our nations and our peoples will honour their commitments undertaken in the United Nations - commitments which, under the Charter, we are duty-bound to strengthen. Thus, we will work to bring together individuals and peoples whose legitimate aspiration is to live, in harmony, in a world of peace, freedom, justice and social progress. I reaffirm the commitment of the people of Mali, of the Democratic Union of Mali and of the Mali Government - in particular. President Moussa Traore - to work tirelessly towards the attainment of these noble deals of the United Nations.
","Our fears have been confirmed by the massacres of Namibian fighters that darkened the initial days of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the recent assassination of Anton Åubowski, the incorporation into the South African security forces in Namibia of elements of the Koevoet, which is a veritable death squad, and the intimidation of Namibians by the South African security forces - in a word, by all the sordid plots hatched by the Pretoria racists. A perverted independence and a failed decolonisation would betray all the sacrifices made by the heroic Namibian people and the commendable efforts of the international community to assert the inalienable rights of peoples and to protect international peace and security. My country is convinced that the international community roust remain vigilant in view of the manoeuvres of the racist regime of Pretoria, and at the special session of the General Assembly on the policy of apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa, planned for next December, we shall express our complete solidarity with the valiant people of South Africa. The international community must also intensify its efforts to bring about the limitation  reduction and elimination of weapons in order to focus all its economic strength and its technological skill at the development of Member States and international co-operation among all the nations of the world. By promoting development that is ecologically rational, the United Nations system and the entire international community are demonstrating a commendable awareness of the grave danger that human needs and the vicissitudes of climate pose to the ecological balance of our world."
44,1989,VCT,"ï»¿The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to offer Mr. Joseph Garba its sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We look forward eagerly to playing our part to ensure the success of the session under his experienced leadership.
The historic forty-third session is still fresh in our minds, and we would be found wanting if we failed to pay a tribute to the former President, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the efficient manner in which he presided over the forty-third session of the Assembly, thus ensuring its successful conclusion.
My delegation wishes to congratulate the Secretary-General for his enlightening and comprehensive report on the work of the organization and for his initiatives during the past year in pursuit of peace and security.
There is a wind of change blowing in international politics. We witness a trend in international relations in which confrontation is being replaced by co-operation, and bitter cold-war rivalries of the past by consensus and mutual accommodation. The present mood to a large extent reflects the easing of East-West tension and greater co-operation between the major Powers. The international community welcomes the progress made by the United States and the Soviet Union in negotiations aimed at reducing by half their stockpile of strategic weapons. The prospects for a comprehensive and verifiable treaty banning chemical weapons, which has been proposed by both super-Powers, is also very exciting.

The eyes of the world are upon us at this time. The General Assembly at this session will earn the respect of the present as well as future generations, if, through its deliberations and decisions, it can sustain the present trend and widen the current detente to ensure peace and progress for all mankind. The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines applauds the people of Poland for their historic decision to enhance democracy and move to an open-market economy.
The positive developments in the Soviet Union, Hungary and East Europe, inspired by General Secretary Gorbachev, hold tremendous lessons for the third world on the evolution of political theory.
The cordial atmosphere of international politics today presents an opportunity which should not be missed for resolving those intractable regional conflicts which for so long have destabilized the world community.
In Afghanistan, in spite of the 1988 Geneva Agreements and the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the war continues unabated. The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports the Secretary-General in the efforts he is making to facilitate a settlement. We look forward to a return to normalcy in that country torn by civil war, and to the early return to their homeland of the millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
The fragile cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and the direct talks between the two sides have yielded no conclusive results. We urge the Governments of the two countries to co-operate with the Secretary-General's efforts to transform the present cease-fire into a lasting peace based on Security Council resolution 598 (1987). While the Paris Conference on Cambodia held in August did not yield a comprehensive solution to the problem, it was nevertheless a commendable step towards achieving the conditions necessary for the Cambodian people to freely exercise their right to self-determination.
We also applaud the diplomatic and other initiatives of fee Association of South-East Asian Nations and hope that all other interested parties will join in the search for a durable peace in Cambodia.
The problem of the two Koreas still remains unresolved. It appears that efforts to establish a machinery for dialogue and peace have made no substantial progress. It is fee firm belief of my delegation that the admission of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations would not only be in conformity with the principle of universality, but would help to create a better political environment for a peaceful solution of the Korean question.
My delegation looks forward with enthusiasm to the implementation of the Secretary-General's peace plan for Western Sahara. We hope feat there can be an early referendum on self-determination. We urge continued dialogue between the POLISARIO and fee Kingdom of Morocco and a continued search for a settlement of this issue within the framework of the proposals of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.
While encouraging signs have emerged on the political horizon in many parts of the world, there are some intractable problems which defy our best efforts to find solutions.
The oppressed majority of South Africans are still struggling to achieve their freedom and self-determination. My delegation reiterates its call for the intensification of sanctions and other forms of pressure by the international community on South Africa for the eliminating of the inhuman system of apartheid and for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.  The end of Namibia's long road to independence is in sight. The withdrawal of South African forces and the demobilization and disarming of territorial forces were' carried out on scheme, the draft electoral law is under careful examination before final assent is given, political detainees have been released by both Parties to the conflict; some 83 per cent of estimated eligible Namibians have demonstrated their commitment to the electoral process by registering to vote a month before the deadline, and many thousands of refugees, some in exile for a whole generation, have returned to their homeland. These are all positive steps leading to the eventual independence of Namibia. We join those who have paid a tribute to the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and Deputy, and the many United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) military police and civilian personnel for their dedication and personal commitment to Namibia's freedom.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines fully supports the United Nations plan for implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and calls on all parties not to impede the movement towards peace. My country looks forward to the day when the Namibian people, who have waited so long for the opportunity to determine their future, take their seat as the newest Member of this Organization. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is concerned that recent efforts to bring about a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict have not yielded any positive results. My country will support any initiative which is aimed at securing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). There is today growing support for a properly structured conference based on Israel's right to exist and recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. We support that proposal.
The bloody civil war drags on endlessly in Lebanon. My delegation supports all initiatives, including those of the Arab League, for stabilizing the situation in that strife-torn country. All the parties to the conflict should move towards securing an effective cease-fire and initiating the process of national reconciliation leading to the full exercise of Lebanese sovereignty. All external pressures in Lebanon should be removed in order that the Lebanese parties might agree on some viable system of peaceful coexistence.
Last year this body paid a glowing tribute to all those serving and those who have served in the United Nations peace-keeping forces on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for
'their achievement and their contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping operations and, by extension to world peace and security'. Today, we lament and deplore the tragic, cold-blooded murder of Lt. Colonel William R. Higgins, a United States citizen, while serving in the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Lebanon. We call on those organizations or groups which are at present holding foreign hostages to release then and thus end their suffering and that of their relatives and friends. We also urge those countries with influence over the hostage-takers to assist in arresting this crime against humanity and to help to bring all the foreign hostages home from Lebanon.
Turning to my own region, Latin America and the Caribbean, my delegation welcomes the very positive developments in Central America. We commend the five Central American Governments for their determined efforts to restore peace and stability to the region and call on the international community to do all in its power further to advance the peace process.
My country welcomes the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol which opens the way foe accession of the Caribbean nations of Belize and Guyana to the Organization of American States.
We also note with satisfaction the progress being made in the Republic of Chile for the full restoration of its democratic institutions.
The eastern Caribbean, particularly Antigua and Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Montserrat and Saint Kitts and Nevis recently experienced the full force of hurricane Hugo, which left death and considerable damage to housing, infrastructure and agriculture in its wake. The road to recovery will be long and costly and we hope that the international community will move swiftly to assist in the rehabilitation efforts.
While being encouraged by all the positive developments in the international community, my Government feels, however, that insufficient progress was registered during the past year in resolving various existing non-military threats to global peace and security. These threats include persistent poverty in many parts of the world, lack of economic growth and development, large-scale unemployment, injustice and inequalities between nations and severe environmental degradation. These problems tend to be global in scope and require the concerted efforts of the international community to find solutions to them.
The fruits of science and technology are very unevenly distributed internationally and in the current North-South frame of analysis, the developing countries of the South find themselves falling further behind in the race for development and progress. The external debt crisis continues to impede growth in developing countries and this situation is aggravated by fundamental imbalances in the international monetary system.
Protectionism is on the increase and the terms of trade for the primary-producing  countries still work against them in the current unfavourable international market situation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the convening of the special session of the General assembly devoted to international co-operation, the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, and the preparation of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade - all of which will be held within the coming year. We hope that these conferences will lead to a clearer understanding of the present problems in the areas of trade, external debt and development.
The international community should be constantly reminded of the problems of small island developing States, in which category Saint Vincent and the Grenadines falls. These States are characterized by narrow economic bases, limited internal markets, diseconomies of scale, and lack of opportunities to take advantage of external markets. There is a further disadvantage in that many of these States - like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines - are archipelagic, a phenomenon which poses seriou3 problems with consequential economic and social cost. 
Their small size also makes such States run the risk of being overlooked in international economic and financial decision-making. It is important that adequate resources be made available to them on appropriate terms for national development.
The population explosion of our time and over-exploitation of the natural resources of our planet due to poverty and rapid economic expansion have resulted 
in a number of environmental problems which put at risk the entire human race. The issues of toxic waste, deforestation, desertification, acid rain, the widening gap in the ozone layer, erratic climatic changes and the greenhouse effect are global in scope and must be dealt with by the entire international community working together. Swift and workable solutions must be found if mankind is to preserve the environment for coming generations.

Other problems in society, such as the international flow of refugees, the status of women and children, and the international scourge of drugs continue to require the urgent attention of the international community.
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines recognizes the grave danger that international drug trafficking and drug abuse pose to all countries. That scourge transcends national borders and it is imperative that international co-operation be increased and intensified to eradicate it from the face of the globe. To that end, my delegation gives unqualified support to the proposal of Trinidad and Tobago for the establishment of an international criminal court to investigate and adjudicate the criminal responsibilities of persons engaged in drug trafficking, and to the initiative of Jamaica for the establishment of a United Nations multilateral, multisectoral force that would provide assistance to States, on their request, in the areas of intelligence and interdiction.
The next decade will perhaps be the most challenging ever faced by human society. Advances in science and technology have put into our hands the means of achieving unlimited progress. Current developments in nuclear technology, space travel, oceanography and biotechnology will profoundly affect our lives in the future. But the same technology can be the means of annihilating the human race. Some of the fundamental issues facing the world today have to do with life and death and survival.
 As we examine these issues during the remainder of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will work with all other nations in the interest of world peace, security and prosperity. 
","The General Assembly at this session will earn the respect of the present as well as future generations, if, through its deliberations and decisions, it can sustain the present trend and widen the current detente to ensure peace and progress for all mankind. These threats include persistent poverty in many parts of the world, lack of economic growth and development, large-scale unemployment, injustice and inequalities between nations and severe environmental degradation. The issues of toxic waste, deforestation, desertification, acid rain, the widening gap in the ozone layer, erratic climatic changes and the greenhouse effect are global in scope and must be dealt with by the entire international community working together.

44,1989,VEN,"ï»¿
Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to extend to you the greetings and congratulations of Venezuela's people and Government on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at this session. My congratulations go also to the other members of the Bureau. At the same time, we address words of thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, for the extraordinary manner in which he carried out his tasks at the last session, as well as to the Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the excellent work he has done.
In the last decade of the twentieth century, we must pause to reflect on the history and experience of this century. Today we can begin to assess what these last 10 years of our century will be and should be. The super-Powers have entered into a period of detente, accommodation and co-operation, with vital initiatives, particularly with regard to nuclear and conventional disarmament, and a determination to solve and not to interfere in regional conflicts that have brought so much human and material harm to the countries of the third world.
This irrational period of the cold war has also left behind a tragic situation   the world's economy and a crisis from which the great power cannot escape, because no economy can finance unlimited military spending. We have all paid for this, but most especially the countries of the third world. 	It would seem, that we can at long last discern a willingness by the international society to tolerate its own diversity and to act jointly to reduce and whenever possible remove sources of tension and convicts we had virtually grown accustomed to living with. I wish to express Venezuela's appreciation of the initiatives of detente and disarmament undertaken by the super-Powers, and express to their leaders our confidence in their determination and perseverance. If the major blocs manage to arrive at concerted action, we shall at long last begin to overcome the cold war and the threat of nuclear warfare.
Thirteen years ago on 16 November 1976, I came to this rostrum as President of Venezuela. On that occasion I said that the global political balance ostensibly rested on peaceful coexistence - peaceful coexistence which by its very name only meant a longer or shorter truce. I defined the separation, the dismembering, of world into antagonistic blocs, for interdependence to achieve equality and co-operation among equals had not prevailed in the relations between powerful countries and between the  powerful and the weaker countries. I then proposed, as I do today, the establishment of a new international economic order, for, otherwise, the world's political balance will continue to be in serious jeopardy. 
As I recall those words, I must acknowledge with deep concern, now that the sovereign will of my people has brought me once again to the presidency that, tragically, the call I then made to the conscience of the developed countries remains timely. Throughout all these years the developed countries' relations with the weaker, developing nations have deteriorated. Not only has trade between North and South become even more unfair than it was 13 years ago, but the situation has worsened substantially through the decade now ending, with the unbearable problem of debt.
As regards this crisis that undermines the stability of the debtor countries, no one can claim that there have not been enough warnings or that successive formulas for its solution have not been presented. Venezuela has always been willing to explore such formulas. It is not acceptable that debtor countries should continue to finance the growth of industrialized nations through net transfers of resources. It is essential to reverse this trend so that the developing countries may be able to finance their own sustained growth and their peoples' well-being.
Initiatives aimed at reducing both the amount of debt and the cost of servicing - particularly those embodied in the so-called Brady plan - are positive steps that confirm the political nature of the crisis and the principle of co-responsibility for its solution. However, the contributions offered by creditor nations and by international commercial banks remain insufficient - to say the least.
The efforts we can all make to solve the debt problem cannot be divorced from the general evolution of relations between the third world and the industrialized countries. The gravity of the situation, so often pointed to, lies in the fact that the existing economic relations between North and South have compromised, and continue to compromise, our possibilities for development. It is clear to all that, without sustained economic growth, the essential investment in social and political areas is impossible.
The alarming aspect of this situation is that, as yet, there is no clear vision or awareness in the developed countries of what is really at stake. What could be more brittle or unpredictable than societies that have no hope and no confidence? It is claimed that harsh economic adjustments will be sufficient. Indeed, Venezuela believes those to be necessary, but without a solution to the debt problem, without broader external support, those adjustments are not feasible, and the political stability of our countries, and even the world's political balance, are endangered.
Ultimately, crises are brought about by failure to interpret objectively existing risk indicators and by lack of willingness to commit the necessary ideas and resources to prevent them. The debt crisis requires the same long-range vision as was applied to Japan and Europe after the war. What is at stake is the destiny of mankind. Almost one third of the world's population is unable to achieve a solution to the problem of economic growth as a prerequisite to the possibility of servicing the debt. The danger of a social explosion embracing over 1 billion human beings will not be avoided, and the consequences of that explosion will be felt in the industrialized nations, which look with unprecedented coldness upon the rapid deterioration of the situation*
This year Venezuela has become a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement. In so doing, we have joined the great community of third world countries, which recognize non-alignment as the choice most consonant with our reality and aspirations, and which trust in the strength of unity to give our positions the weight they need to promote changes in contemporary politics and economics.
Venezuela has always placed special emphasis on the importance of relations between developing countries. We are convinced that we, the countries of the third world, will never be able to exercise fully our political sovereignty, or to achieve equity in our economic relations with developed countries, unless we substantially enhance South-South relations, as an indispensable premise for strengthening our bargaining capacity. International society need not be condemned permanently to be governed by the patterns of the past. That is clear from what is happening today in East-West relations and from the efforts of European countries to assert their identity and explore new avenues. The international system must evolve and reflect today's pluralism. It is our aim to ensure that developing countries - our culture, our economies and our political realities - are fully incorporated into a multipolar world. It is with this vision, which transcends conflicts and highlights affinities and common potential, that we strive to equip ourselves with the institutions we need to be able to speak out and to act more effectively.
Venezuela, like other developing countries, is aware of the need to work towards revitalizing the North-South dialogue. In this regard Venezuela stated its position at the forty-third session of the General Assembly. It reiterated that position at the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting of the Group of 77, held in Caracas in June  in the Paris initiative, taken by the Presidents of Egypt, Senegal and Venezuela and by the Prime Minister of India during their meeting on the occasion of the bicentennial of the French Revolution; and, more recently, at the meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, where it was firmly supported by all the Movement's members, and a group of 15 countries, representing Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe, was established. That group will hold annual meetings, at the level of Heads of State or Government, to discuss issues of interest to the countries that make up the South.
Latin America, despite the changes it has gone through, is not immune to political difficulties. Allow me to mention in particular the evolution of the Central American situation. The latest developments, as illustrated by the Tela agreements, in Honduras, confirm that, with autonomy, with confidence and with international support, the Central American countries will be able to achieve peace. 
We also welcome the agreement reached by El Salvador with the leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front on a suspension of hostilities and the beginning of negotiations with the Government of El Salvador which would enable those leaders to become involved in the political and democratic process of that country.
Few cases have better illustrated than those in Latin America the harm caused by foreign interference, based on false premises of strategic interest.
Elsewhere in Central America we are watching with concern developments in Panama. The abrogation of its democratic process, apart from denying the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to choose its own Government, is a factor destabilizing the vigorous process of democratisation in Latin America. Nothing would be more unacceptable to us than a crisis that would call into question the Torrerijos-Carter Treaties, which we consider to be an accomplishment of Latin American solidarity and a commitment uniting all our peoples.
Those of us who, like Venezuela, have a direct responsibility in this historical   claim   of Latin America, cannot view with indifference the build-up of elements of tension. Nothing can be more important for Latin America than to have the Panamanian community democratically settle its disagreements and to see the provisions of the Canal Treaties complied with to the letter. 
I wish to say how pleased we Venezuelans are to see the beginning of a process that will lead to self-determination for the Puerto Rican people. We are linked to Puerto Rico by strong ties of history and culture. However, only the people of Puerto Rico can decide its future. This year there have been new developments, and Venezuela trusts that they will soon make it possible for the preferences of the people of Puerto Rico to be made known in a free expression of sovereign will. We cannot conceal the fact that we Latin Americans wish to see Puerto Rico become another Latin nation, like those our liberators dreamed of and fought for. In those cases, which I have mentioned, because of their importance for Venezuela and for Latin America as a whole, a fundamental role is played by the United States of America. Venezuela hopes that friendly country will continue its present course of favouring multilateral dialogue and continued consultations. We are convinced that that is the only way for the American continent to advance towards the achievement of those values to which we all subscribe, both within the inter-American system and within the United Nations system.
Venezuela strives for close relations and co-operation in its foreign policy. We still have difficult historical obstacles to overcome. One is the reconciliation of our Latin American, continental and Caribbean identities. We had been separated from the Caribbean by colonialism and its divisive sequels. Today we can applaud the great advances the nations of the Caribbean have made in fostering their own identity and their admirable efforts at rapprochement with the rest of our region. Those countries not only are our neighbours and friends, but are also an inextricable part of Latin America with which we share opportunities and hopes in a common future.
To conclude the presentation of our views on Latin American affairs, I shall refer briefly to the Group of Eight. This year there will be held in Lima, Peru, the third presidential meeting of the permanent mechanism for political consultation and co-ordination. This mechanism has transformed the scope of our relations in Latin America and our approach to them.
Venezuela reiterates its rejection of colonialism and all forms of racial discrimination. We share the deep concern of the other Members of the United Nations, particularly the countries of southern Africa, over the persistence of the genocidal system of apartheid, which is a Nazi-style violation of human rights, a crime against humanity. We welcome with great satisfaction the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on apartheid.
I turn to the subject of decolonisation. We have consistently supported initiatives aimed at removing the last vestiges of colonialism, particularly those relating to the independence of Namibia and the implementation of the Security Council's plan for that purpose. We trust that the countries directly involved in solving the problem will continue to show the necessary political will to bring the process to a successful conclusion with the holding of the elections scheduled for November, under United Nations supervision.
We are watching with hope developments with regard to the problem of Western Sahara. We support the initiatives of the Secretary-General and reaffirm our conviction that direct dialogue will contribute effectively to recognition of the rights of the Sahraoui people, the resolution of the conflict and the process of integration in the Mahgreb.
We Latin Americans must include in this survey the case of the Malvinas. We trust that the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom, in keeping with resolutions of the United Nations and international law and solidarity, will initiate talks aimed at settling the controversy concerning sovereignty over those islands in the South Atlantic, which have formed part of the Argentine Republic since we Latin American peoples became independent from Spain.
I cannot fail to mention the dreadful tragedy of Lebanon, a land torn by a suicidal and diabolical conflict. The Lebanese people deserve the support and protection of the world. We commend the decision of the Arab League to set up a commission made up of the sovereigns of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and the President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria to mediate in that horrible and absurd conflict. Venezuela appeals to the United Nations to show the greatest diligence in bringing about an end to the terrible massacres and violations of human rights, and we shall co-operate in any initiative in which we can play a useful part.
In view of their paramount importance for the life of our societies and for international security, I shall now touch upon the problems of drugs and the environment. In 1984 Venezuela put forward a draft convention (resolution 39/141, annex) concerning the struggle against illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances. We are happy to see today ever-growing support for that draft convention.
At the non-aligned Summit, Venezuela, together with other Latin American countries, recently proposed other initiatives with regard to the prevention of and action against the laundering of money proceeding from drug trafficking. A systematic effort is being made in our countries and at a sub regional Andean level to eradicate that evil.
This year, the gravity and extent of that crime against humanity have been highlighted by the current events in Colombia. International solidarity has remained more a matter of words than of deeds. Let us look, for example, at the behaviour of the United States. Undoubtedly, that country came to the fore in offering solidarity and material aid, but instead of such circumstantial aid, would it not have been more important to strengthen the Colombian economy by supporting the International Coffee Agreement?
But that was not the case. Besieged by drug-trafficking dollars, the coffee-growing countries, Colombia and other indebted countries such as Brazil amongst them, have seen their resources dwindle as a result of the United States' refusal to subscribe to the agreements of the International Coffee Organization. Prices have plummeted. How can we fight drug-trafficking in those circumstances, with such low prices for our commodities and such heavy debts?
Nevertheless, we welcome the agreement reached at the Paris Summit. We are convinced that little can be achieved without forceful action upon demand. It is up to the producer countries to fight the trafficking, but the consumer countries must also drastically curb their demand, since that is what makes the struggle against drug-trafficking so much more difficult.
 The fight against drug-trafficking must be relentless and forceful. Let us not forget that, besides the erosion of our institutions and its impact upon health, drug trafficking and consumption are linked to terrorism, clandestine arms trafficking, the revival of mercenary activities, and the violation of human rights.
I must say that despite all that 1 have stated in a spirit of optimism, the fight against drugs must be the subject of international legislation sponsored by the United Nations in a world conference that will confront this crime which knows no frontiers and which uses them only to evade and trample upon our sovereignty and well-being.
At the Ninth Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade, I proposed the convening of a world conference to discuss an international convention against drug-trafficking that would be binding on all countries of the world.
As to the environment, allow me to reiterate what I have said in other forums. Development and the environment are interrelated. Until now, they have been inimical. It is necessary for developed and developing countries to approach the problem jointly and to reconcile our perspectives in a united effort that will enable us to preserve our environmental heritage without detriment to our common right to development.
I wish to propose that the Members of the United Nations formulate a convention that will commit all of us. My country belongs to an essential region of the world, the immense Amazonia. The eight nations making up that region have established the Amazonian Pact whereby, without relinquishing our sovereignty, we have sought to ensure its conservation as a patrimony of mankind and as a legacy of nature to the development and wealth of our nations.
Venezuela fully supports the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of developing countries to be held in April 1990. We shall be present at that important event. We also wish to express our great interest in seeing the successful completion of the preliminary work being done on the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade.
Let us dedicate the next decade of the twentieth century to the preservation of children, the future of mankind in the third millennium of our world. Let us set about reducing by half the death rate of children as well as of mothers. Let us strive for a universal primary school education and the elimination of severe malnutrition.
In this forum of mankind, I should like to invite you all to subscribe to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which represents the consensus of all the Governments of the world as to the minimum guarantees that every society must offer to its children. That must become the new international ethic. Venezuela will support in the Assembly this agreement aimed at safeguarding the most extensively violated rights of the world - the rights of children. We shall also support the holding of a world summit devoted to childhood, as proposed by the United Nations Children's Fund. To the Prime Minister of Sweden, who was the first to support that summit, we offer our full co-operation in sponsoring it, together with the other nations wishing to join that initiative.
In April of this year, at the 12th meeting of Ministers of Health of the Andean Countries in Caracas, I suggested the convening of a Latin American regional summit. Our regional statistics are truly alarming. One million children under the age of five die every years 360,000 in Brazil, 175,000 in Mexico, 245,000 in the Andean countries. Every Latin American child is born with an external debt of $32,000 and a social debt of $23,000. Every newborn child receives a historical liability of 360,000, equivalent to more than 25 time3 our nations' gross domestic product per capita. In sum, in Latin America most of the children are poor and most of the poor are children.
Human eclipse or social development! that is the choice facing mankind on the eve of the third millennium.
We have come to the United Nations to advocate international co-operation. Let us not close our eyes to the countless dangers that we face at this promising moment. Let us take note of the dangers and work together to further the prevalence of reason. The economic and social problems our peoples face are immense, and we have no right to postpone solutions or open the door to conflict and instability. Strategic confrontation dominated the best minds of this past century. Perhaps it is now time to turn our eyes upon ourselves, upon our peoples and our societies, to assess their condition, their moral wants, their crises, and attempt to find solutions.
 		This will make us realize how mistaken we have been this last, turbulent half of the twentieth century, and will open a gateway of hope so that, as we approach this magical date of the third millennium, we may be confident that in the new century all nations of the world will be able to march forward together in a spirit, of solidarity, with a single aims to ensure the well being of all mankind.
","The super-Powers have entered into a period of detente, accommodation and co-operation, with vital initiatives, particularly with regard to nuclear and conventional disarmament, and a determination to solve and not to interfere in regional conflicts that have brought so much human and material harm to the countries of the third world. The gravity of the situation, so often pointed to, lies in the fact that the existing economic relations between North and South have compromised, and continue to compromise, our possibilities for development. We share the deep concern of the other Members of the United Nations, particularly the countries of southern Africa, over the persistence of the genocidal system of apartheid, which is a Nazi-style violation of human rights, a crime against humanity. Venezuela appeals to the United Nations to show the greatest diligence in bringing about an end to the terrible massacres and violations of human rights, and we shall co-operate in any initiative in which we can play a useful part. Let us not forget that, besides the erosion of our institutions and its impact upon health, drug trafficking and consumption are linked to terrorism, clandestine arms trafficking, the revival of mercenary activities, and the violation of human rights."

Happily, the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization provided more than one occasion for a smile of contentment to relieve the more usual grin with clenched teeth induced by realistic surveys of world affairs. Two of these pleasing if small occasions were his congratulating us on a deflationary trend in our rhetoric and on a growth of civility in our exchanges. The proffering of our congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency, and of thanks to your predecessor, as well as to the Secretary-General himself, is part of due courtesy, not of vain rhetoric. Indeed it is possible, as in this case, to make ritual gestures with the greatest sincerity.
The Secretary-General's report allowed us to note, with very great satisfaction, that the performance of the United Nations has improved in substance as well as in form. I do not intend to rehearse either the range of successes achieved or the persistent doldrums afflicting us. I would merely echo the sentiments already expressed by others. In this regard I will echo a statement made here by my predecessor, Mr. George Borg-Olivier, the first Prime Minister of independent Malta - an independence which was achieved only 25 years ago, despite our existence as a nation for thousands of years.
The most critical role in the transformation of the international cacophony of the past into a joyous future symphony appertains to the super-Powers, but no orchestra generally functions satisfactorily if it is made up only of trombones and timpani. Some part is usually played by a flute or a piccolo. If the voice of a micro-State such as ours does have any special claim to be heard in this assembly, it is certainly not because we include ourselves that smallness of size or antiquity of national origin dowers us with some sort of superior Olympian wisdom. It is rather that our mini-stature does tend to make our self-interest more nearly coincide with the global interest. A diminutive physique does not go as a rule with an enormous appetite for self-aggrandizement but rather with a point of view that is singularly alert to the prospects and problems of the survival of all in a danger-filled environment. It is very precisely in that perspective that I speak here today.
Let me explain what has prompted me to begin with this reminder. Of the specific issues with which my country has mostly keenly involved itself - from the care of the elderly to the need to curtail the traffic in armaments - from the very first years of our presence here, there is probably none with which the name of Malta has come to be more intimately associated than that of the common management of extraterritorial spaces.
I am using this term deliberately. I am doing so because unfortunately the concept which we introduced and which has been incorporated as a foundation-stone in the law of the sea Convention and used in many other United Nations-sponsored treaties, charters, declarations and other juridical and policy instruments - the common heritage of mankind - continues to be misunderstood. It is not however misunderstood by the Secretary-General, and its essence is very accurately captured in the phrase he uses in his report where he refers to 'common management ... reflecting a community of interest among Member States'.
Precisely this identification of 'a community of interest* among all nations, developing and developed - for the benefit of all, rich as well as poor, whatever the nature of their ideology as well as their geography - was the motive force that moved us.
The areas of coincidence between the interests of all categories of States were our target. Ours was not a move in a rush or onset by the hungry to gobble down sundry goods spread out on somebody else's table. On the contrary our starting point was the existence of goods which had two characteristics: in the first place, they were not on anybody's table; they lay still unexplored and un-exploited beyond the limits of national jurisdiction? they were the resources of extraterritorial spaces; and, secondly, their nature and location implied that they could not be rationally managed on the basis of legal regimes conceived in terms of the conventional notions of 'property' and of 'sovereignty' with the absolutist connotations they have acquired in the modern age.
Our idea was that the common heritage of mankind should not be considered as the property of, or as subject to, the sovereignty of anybody - not of the United Nations any more than of any individual country, not of the human collectivity any more than of any smaller human entity, not at any rate in any sense in which the owner or the sovereign can do with it as it pleases him.
Quite different and novel rules of management had to be devised. The Law of the Sea constitutes of course a major, however imperfect, step in that direction. It contains recognition that the vastness of extraterritorial space is not so unlimited that human activity cannot cause irreparable damage to it. Even more serious dangers lurk in other extraterritorial spaces where the measures so far taken have been more fragmentary. Consequently I am urging the Assembly to take a fresh look at the whole matter not in the conceptual framework of the debates about property and sovereignty which were comprehensible in the world of the past but in the new situation produced by the development of man's scientific and technological activities. What is at stake is not at all competition between East and West, or even primarily between North and South, but the victory of order over chaos, of survival over planetary destruction.
My Government is convinced that there can be no true development without an environment which will permit mankind to live a life of dignity and well-being.
Furthermore, new technologies, population growth and the human urge to develop have brought about new, serious threats to the delicate ecological balance of our globe. Indeed we believe that certain of these threats risk causing irreparable damage, thereby endangering the very existence of life on Garth*
Urgent action is needed to save our planet. The new environmental problems call for innovative solutions to be devised. That is why we actively supported the initiative taken by Prance, the Netherlands and Norway, which led to the Hague Declaration on the atmosphere and climate change, signed last March.
Malta is raising its environmental concerns in every forum. It will be recalled that Malta's initiative to protect the global climate led to resolution 43/53, which was unanimously adopted, entitled 'Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind', which characterized climate change as the common concern of mankind.
The resolution sets out what is essentially a plan of action to counter the growing problem of adverse climate change. We are satisfied with the progress which is being made in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established by the world Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme. We are convinced that if any proposed remedies are to be effected they have to take into account the economies of developing States.
Those States which have already developed and polluted cannot now expect other States to stultify their own growth. This has to be the basis of any international convention on climate, if it is to enjoy widespread and general acceptance.
Malta has also actively participated in the Commonwealth Group of Experts on Climate Change, and it looks forward to the outcome of the discussion of the subject at the October meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, to be held in Malaysia.
A new proposal which we are putting forward for active consideration at this forty-fourth session, and which I am pleased to announce has been accepted by the Assembly's General Committee, as agenda item 82 (j), is the protection of the environment of extraterritorial spaces. In this respect we are suggesting that
as a first step a group of eminent parsons be invited to prepare a study, possibly in time for consideration at the 1992 United Nations conference on environment and development.
The group's first effort could be an attempt to identify and specify the extraterritorial spaces and to examine which human activities are causing unreasonable damage to the environmental integrity of such spaces. Clearly, its task will be formidable, for, while it is important not to regulate too late, it is not desirable to seek to regulate non-existent activities. Likewise, it may avoid unnecessary complexity by not seeking to tackle the common heritage as a whole, but restricting the immediate area of attention to extraterritorial spaces. Besides the high seas and the international sea-bed area, the super adjacent airspace, certain parts of the atmosphere and outer space, as well as such other more controversial areas as may be determined, will have to be evaluated from the point of view of their environmental state.
Recommendations could then be made regarding the rights and duties of States and of the international community and the revised or new legal instruments needed, at least for catastrophe avoidance. The group's report could serve at least as a preliminary basis on which our thinking could be realistically built in view of the new global requirements of present and future generations.
So far I have been seeking to take account of the fact that it is not only the problems of ocean space' that are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole', as the preamble to the Convention on the Law of the Sea says. It is all the parts of our small planet, which are closely bound together in a single web.
Nevertheless, the Convention and its sober consolidation open up the possibility of turning ocean space into a real laboratory in the service of true development, with respect for the environment, which could be exemplary for other areas and, indeed, a foundation for the whole. For that reason, I wish to develop further the two main suggestions which I made in this regard when I last had the privilege of addressing the General Assembly, and to clarify the essential thrust of both. Their common pivot is the need to associate, in the governance of the institutions suited for ocean affairs and their analogues in other multiple-use domains, representatives of the whole cast of very varied actors who operate in the sea, instead of merely the representatives of States.
Consequently, my first suggestion was the establishment of a global forum on ocean affairs, where the representatives of States could meet and interact with those of all the specialized agencies of the United Nations system and of other intergovernmental and non-governmental, scientific, commercial, environmental and other organizations with an active and participative stake in the management of ocean affairs in an integrated manner.
My second suggestion, also intended to facilitate the bringing into play of the potentialities of network building, was the systematic strengthening of regional institutions as an intermediate level, meshing the national and the global.
Several notable efforts have been made, and are still being made, in that direction by the United Nations and its agencies. But there is still a central void - that of means by which all the key actors in a sphere of activities can be brought together. Unfortunately, the all-too-often un-harmonized operations of the different parts of national Governments themselves in the marine sphere are at present
reflected at the international level, and, for instance, the establishment of large exclusive economic zones in terms of the law of the sea Convention requires integrated management systems, which it is difficult to set up by the unaided efforts of many an individual State.
The extension of national jurisdiction necessitates more, not less, international co-operation. Indeed, there are many articles in the Convention itself which prescribe co-operation with coastal States by the competent international authorities - meaning, in most cases, United Nations agencies.
My suggestion in this regard is, therefore, that regional commissions for ocean affairs be set up. They should have a very mixed membership. There should not be meetings of representatives only of ministries of foreign affairs, or only of environment or transport ministries, or only of international organizations, or other entities of one kind only. All of the following should be there: the national focal points or other co-ordinating centres of national marine activities, if they exist, as they should; the regional officers of the specialized United Nations agencies; and other bodies, both intergovernmental and governmental.
Moreover, the commissions should directly involve at all stages of their work the major ocean users from all countries affected by regional decisions. Experience has shown that the contributions of the actual users of resources usually prove extremely valuable to prevent political obstacles from blocking the progress of regional planning, or to circumvent them. The characteristic input of actual users is to anticipate such problems before they become frustrating and to devise procedures for their avoidance. Their participation is vital to the commissions' fulfilment of their role. That role is essentially one of rationalization. Consequently, the cost should not be heavy, No new large bureaucracies are needed, because all of the elements of the system are already in existence. There is only a need for them to be catalysed.
I have dwelt on this point at some length not merely for its own sake hut also as an illustration of the new style of international governance that seems to be called for at the present juncture in world affairs. Similar organizational models can be envisaged in other spheres of activity, such as labour relations. The international Labour Organisation (ILO) is, of course, a very striking instance of an early structure involving State and non-state organizations as an essential aspect of the functioning of its system.
A fundamental point of thrust for the regional commissions for ocean affairs should be the development of technological capability. It is clearly in the fields of scientific research and technological capability that investment by funding agencies, national and international, is most inadequate and yet, over the years, most likely to yield the most enduring contribution to human betterment.
Two years ago I mentioned here that in fulfilment of articles 276 and 277 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Malta had proposed the setting up of a Mediterranean regional centre for the development of marine technology. We envisaged that through it enterprises, both public and private, and organizations, both national and international, would be involved in the financing of projects judged to be of general benefit. We also expected that it would be a pilot undertaking to be followed in other regions, one reciprocally beneficial to both the developed and the developing countries of the region.
I am happy to report that with the direct support of the Secretary-General and his excellent collaborators the proposal has been pursued, especially through the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and that it has found the support of several Mediterranean countries. I would like to stress again that, far from seeking to rival or compete with any other existing institutions, particularly European ones, the centre would complement and enhance their activities with advantages to all. I am therefore confident that the centre will emerge as a model of North-South - and particularly of Euro-African- Asian - co-operation in the one area of the world where the three continents meet around the 'Middle Sea', at the very centre of which my country is placed.
I have, as I said I would at the beginning, concentrated on only a few topics so that they stand out in a sharper focus. To some extent this is more possible today because the atmosphere in international relations is improving so much that we have an opportunity co take a broader look and to identify other global dangers, in particular those that threaten the environment and the economic system.
That does not mean that we are insensitive to a number of disputes that linger on, defying solution and spreading misery to the peoples involved. Many speakers more directly involved in those questions have drawn our attention to their plight. The greatest service we can do for those people is to act, each of us as best we can, so as to encourage real dialogue and so as not to aid and abet those who feel that force or intransigence pay better dividends.
Casting a glance at our region, we feel disappointed that the hopes we had entertained about a solution to the Cyprus problem have received a setback. As an island State in the Mediterranean we cannot but be concerned about the situation in Cyprus, one which, despite the efforts of the Secretary-General and the goodwill the Government of Cyprus has shown, does not seem to be improving as we had all hoped a year ago. We make a strong appeal to all parties directly or indirectly concerned not to miss any opportunity to bring to an end a tragedy that has not brought any benefit to those who sought, rather mistakenly, to find a solution to their problems through division. If we all, without exception, send a cleat message that we do not countenance division in that island nation, the parties directly concerned will not fail to extend the hand of co-operation to the Secretary-General and to each other.
The tragedy of Lebanon is a blot on our civilization and on our times. I had occasion to speak in strong terms on this conflict earlier this month at the summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Belgrade. Since then a ray of hope has appeared with the acceptance of the Arab League initiative. Let us not be lulled into any false complacency. The peoples and Governments of the area have beat presented with an opportunity, but far more strenuous efforts are required to translate that opportunity into a genuine and lasting peace.
A genuine peace in the area can be lasting only when all the peoples living there can exercise their sovereignty in full freedom within accepted and secure borders - and the peoples of the area include the peoples of Israel and Palestine. We encourage the Secretary-General and all others who have taken positive initiatives to persevere in their efforts to bring the day of peace and justice in the area much nearer. The world has been impressed by the responsible and positive attitude taken by the representatives of the Palestinian people to realize their inalienable rights through a political solution, as repeatedly expressed in the United Nations. Their outstretched hand should not be ignored. The peace of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, and peace in the entire region and perhaps even in the entire world, demands a reciprocal move from the other side. We commend and support all constructive efforts being made to assist the process, and we wish to express our appreciation for the leadership exercised by President Mubarak in this regard.
In the other almost traditional areas of conflict that are reflected in our deliberations we have seen over the past year significant, though perhaps hesitant, steps forward. The promise of a solution is there in Central America, in the Sahara, in Namibia, in the Gulf, in Afghanistan and in South-East Asia. Having come this far, why should we betray the hopes of our peoples? Dare we hope that even in South Africa apartheid will be seen by all for the evil that it is and that it will be replaced by a system that gives due dignity to man and woman irrespective of colour or race?
 The aspiration to realize the unity and solidarity of the human race is precisely what inspired the concrete proposals Malta put forward about the common heritage and common concerns of mankind in the oceans, the atmosphere and other extraterritorial spaces. That aspiration is to be pursued not only in political forums, such as the Assembly, but throughout the educational systems of all countries. We are pleased that the new International Maritime Law Institute in Malta, constituted and run by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), is to start receiving students from developing countries this October. It will undoubtedly increase the skills of those who are committed to the search for international solutions that go against the interest of no State but that serve to enhance the common good of all the members of the human race.
","they were the resources of extraterritorial spaces; and, secondly, their nature and location implied that they could not be rationally managed on the basis of legal regimes conceived in terms of the conventional notions of 'property' and of 'sovereignty' with the absolutist connotations they have acquired in the modern age. A new proposal which we are putting forward for active consideration at this forty-fourth session, and which I am pleased to announce has been accepted by the Assembly's General Committee, as agenda item 82 (j), is the protection of the environment of extraterritorial spaces.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to offer you, on behalf of the Ghana delegation, our warm congratulations on your unanimous election. Your election is a reflection not only of the international recognition of the valuable contribution which your country, Nigeria, has made and continues to make towards the promotion of global peace and security, but is also a tribute to the part which you personally have played in fashioning stable and credible international relations. We look forward to working with you in the tradition of our two countries. I should also like to congratulate your immediate predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, for his excellent leadership during the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
Since our last meeting the international political climate has improved but not so the economic situation in most developing countries, which continues to be among the major preoccupations of countries such as mine. In sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, the situation remains critical in spite of the reform policies being implemented by African Governments and tine initiatives being taken by the international community to support African recovery efforts. Urgent measures are required to control the crisis and put Africa an the road to sustainable growth.
The Ghana delegation would like to take this opportunity to express sincere appreciation for the financial end other support extended by the international community to Africa since the last session of the General Assembly.
The fact remains, however, that sub-Saharan Africa will continue to require the maximum support and co-operation of the international community, particularly in dealing with the problems of external constraints, which, as confirmed by the Secretary-General in his report on the mid-term review, are 'emerging as the most critical obstacle to African recovery and development'. These relate to depressed export earnings, the severe debt-servicing burden and insufficient availability of finance.
These obstacles have contributed in no small measure to the weak economic performance of the region, even as global output and trade in 1988 recorded significant growth and expansion. In that year, world trade grew at the remarkable rate of 8.3 per cent and the prices of non-fuel commodities improved substantially. However, the benefits of this strong growth in world trade and output were not evenly shared. Except for metals and sugar, the prices of commodities of interest to Africa either fell or remained weak. Ghana, for instance, lest about 3100 million in 1988 on its earnings from cocoa. With the international cocoa price falling further below last year's levels, the estimates of our losses this year are even higher.
We believe that the way to bring stability to commodity markets and ensure remunerative prices fair to producer and consumer alike is to make effective use of the mechanisms provided by the Integrated Programme for Commodities. One such mechanism is the Common Fund for Commodities. My delegation, therefore, welcomes the coming into force of the Agreement on the Common Find for Commodities earlier this year. We should all work actively and constructively to make the Common Fund a worthy example of international co-operation for development.
The large fiscal and trade imbalances of some of the major economies have created considerable strains in the trading system. Protectionist pressures have been mounting, as have unilateral actions. Access of developing countries' exports to markets in the industrialized countries has become increasingly difficult. The Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations must lead, among other things, to the removal of both tariff and non-tariff barriers, so as to restore free trade to its proper place in the international trading regime.
Seven years ago, the common that had long been growing over the external indebtedness of developing countries erupted into a crisis. Rally aware of its potential for systemic disruption, the international community embarked on an uncertain search for solutions to the problem. Today, we are nowhere near a solution. The crisis has rather deepened. Debt service ratios have on the whole worsened and the magnitude of the debt has increased from a few billion dollars to 31.3 trillion. One can with good reason conclude that the strategies pursued so far have not been effective. The rescheduling of unmet obligations or the provision of funds to pay accrued interests, which have been the hallmark of debt management strategies, have only postponed current obligations and made debt-servicing burdens over the years even more onerous. Characteristic of the two-little-too-late approach to the solution of the debt problem is the rescheduling options for the Paris Club creditors agreed upon at the Toronto summit in June 1988. The Toronto consensus was heralded as holding promise for significant debt relief for the poorest developing countries on the basis of comparable burden-sharing by all official bilateral creditors. Since then the Paris Club has given further definition of the new options, end it is clear that the short-term cash flow benefits are unlikely to have a significant impact on the debt-servicing burdens of the countries concerned.
When the multilateral financial institutions which were created to assist countries in meeting their short aid long-term resource needs become net recipients of resources even from debt distressed developing countries in a region like Africa, it is a clear failure of international policy. The various facilities aid programmes established for the purpose of enhancing the lending capacities of the Bretton Woods institutions, such as the World Bank's special programme of assistance to support concessionary co-financing and the Fund's structural adjustment and enhanced structural adjustment facilities, have not been adequate to stem the tide of reverse transfer of resources to these institutions, particularly the Fund. Furthermore, the commendable effort being made by some debtor countries, in spite of severe resource constraints, to meet their debt and other obligations has resulted in the untenable phenomenon, in recent years, of the net transfer of huge resources from developing to developed countries.
This is indeed troubling because other sources of capital flours have levelled off. Reduction in private lending has been drastic while official development assistance has stagnated at more or less half of the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product established by the United Nations. I must here pay a deserved tribute to those developed countries that have attained or even exceeded this target.
Faced with these constraints, most developing countries carrying out structural adjustment programmes have not been able to register growth in their economies. Investment to enable them to expand their productive base and create jobs and wealth has had to be drastically curtailed. Equally affected is investment in social infrastructure, such as health and education.
In Africa, the economic and social situation is a matter of deep concern. Per capita output has been negative for several consecutive years. Average living standards have been falling end large sections of the population are unable to meet their basic needs. It is a region that, according to the estimates of the Economic Commission for Africa, suffered terms of trade losses in 1987 of the order of $19 billion, transferred over 91 billion net to the International Monetary Find (IMF) and repaid several billion dollars to creditors. It also faces a resource gap variously estimated by the World Bank, the IMF and the Secretary-General's Advisory Group on Resource Flows to Africa to be between 31,5 billion and 3 5 billion per annum.
At a time when many developing countries have been carrying out structural adjustment and policy reforms, it is difficult to understand why their determined efforts should be so needlessly undercut by an inadequate response of the developed countries. It is even more incomprehensible that the industrialized countries stubbornly refuse to engage in such dialogue as would ensure justice for the developing countries. The alternative to dialogue is confrontation. The economic and social hardship imposed on developing countries through a conscious policy of maintaining economic inequalities emanating from colonialism is a potent threat to international peace and security, to the sustainability of the adjustment programmes and indeed of debt-servicing obligations, with dire implications for the international financial system as a whole.
Clearly the growing economic marginalization of important regions in an interdependent world cannot be allowed to continue. That was why the Group of 77 called for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to examine ways and means of reactivating growth, particularly in the developing countries. The session, to be held early next year, should reach a consensus on policy measures to be adopted to ensure the economic recovery and development of the developing countries. The outcome of the special session will no doubt provide useful inputs for the elaboration of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade. We should make the 1990s a decade of hope, of recovery from economic and social decline, of equitable international economic relations, and a decade in which development will regain its lost momentum.
No country can today remain aloof from the concern expressed world-wide over environmental degradation and the daily damage to our climate conditions whose harmful effects know no boundaries. The Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 held in Caracas this year recognized the importance of this issue and emphasized the close relationship between poverty aid environmental degradation. Ghana therefore supports the proposed conference on the environment to be held in 1992.
We wish to stress that the developed countries bear greater responsibility not only because they are largely responsible for the degradation of the environment aid pollution of the atmosphere but also because they have the resources and technical know-hew for reversing the situation while promoting sustainable development. They also have responsibility to stop the unconscionable conduct on the part of their industrialists of dumping hazardous wastes in developing countries. We should also like to see an international convention with appropriate penalties for the dumping of toxic waste. In this connection, it is a matter of deep regret that the Basel Convention of 22 March 1989 on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and Their Disposal has not met the concerns of all. It does not provide for stopping waste traffic from the industrialized world to developing countries desperate for hard currency.
We would also like to caution against the concern for the environment on the part of the developed countries being translated into environmental conditionalities for development assistance. That concern should be channelled into research for new and environmentally more secure technologies that should be freely available to all.
Improved East-West relations continue to strengthen prospects for further advances in arms control and disarmament. This is particularly true of the ongoing East-West talks in Vienna on cutting down conventional weapons and thereby reducing the risk of war in Europe. While the negotiations are fraught with complexities the opening bargaining positions have been close enough to give hope that a conventional arms treaty in Europe could be a reality. The lesson of the Vienna talks should not be lost on developing countries, which should not indulge in unrestricted purchase of such weapons. In this regard much will depend on the extent to which East-West detente aid non-interference in the internal affairs of developing countries makes this unnecessary.
We welcome President Bush's proposals on the banning of chemical weapons and the encouraging response by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Ghana shares the international concern about the use end spread of chemical weapons. This concern underlies our signing of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which outlaws such weapons, aid our support for the declaration adapted at the aid of the Paris Conference held early this year. We hope that the statements by the Soviet Union and the United States will help speed up the Geneva negotiations on a chemical-weapons convention.
With regard to nuclear disarmament, Ghana is concerned about the slow rate of progress so far registered. Despite current positive developments in the field of disarmament, the world is still threatened by the massive stock of nuclear arsenals. We call upon the super-Powers aid other nuclear-weapon States to redeem their promises of effectively eliminating nuclear weapons from our planet.
The global drive for peace continues to show encouraging results in several regions. Conflict and confrontation seem to be giving way to political dialogue and negotiation, aid even if the guns are not entirely silent the over whelming desire is for conciliation and mutual accommodation.
It is a matter of deep regret that the united Nations, which has been a major contributor to this encouraging trend, should continue to be starved of funds, particularly as the reforms recommended in 1985 by the high-level governmental experts have been implemented almost in full.
To the critics of the united Nations we say that the problem does not lie with the Organization. The problem may well lie with their perceptions of the Organization, which fortunately are not shared by the majority of Member States. We wish to reiterate our appeal to those member States still withholding their contributions to release them so as to make the Organization solvent. We also take
this opportunity to support, in principle, the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a special reserve fund for peace-keeping operations.
Ghana had hoped that the month-long Paris Conference on Kampuchea, which ended in failure five weeks ago, would build upon the very useful groundwork done in Indonesia earlier in fee year. We are happy to note, however, that it will reconvene in the spring of 1990. We urge all the parties to exercise maximum flexibility in order to resolve their outstanding differences..
On the Middle East, Ghana continues to support the call for an international peace conference under the auspices of the united Nations, to be attended by all parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), to deal with the problems of Palestinian rights aid secure boundaries for all States in the region. The recently announced, hard-line conditions for carrying out the election proposals made by Israel have not improved the prospects for peace in that troubled land. The conditions - which are that no elections will be held until the intifadah ends, that Arabs in East Jerusalem will not be permitted to take part, that Jewish settlements will continue to be built, and that Israel will not agree to give up any land - are not designed to promote peace. So far, the PLO and its Arab friends have been making all the running for peace. We call upon Israel to reciprocate these peace gestures.
The current peace efforts in the Afghanistan situation urgently need to be strengthened. Eighteen months after the signing of the Geneva Agreements and seven months after the Soviet troop pull-out, Afghanistan continues to suffer from gross and unwarranted external interference. The Assembly should call for the immediate cessation of external interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan so that the Afghan peoples can together reconstruct their corn try.
The peace process in the Iran-Iraq situation also requires a new impetus. He welcome the several rounds of talks under the auspices of the United Nations, including the proposals for confidence-building measures between the two parties. For the peace efforts to succeed, however, Iran and Iraq would have to show the necessary flexibility and move away from the present impasse by narrowing their positions on the constituent elements of the cease-fire, including, in particular, the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries and the early return to navigation of the Shatt a 1-Arab waterway. We also call upon the two parties to allow the prisoner-of-war exchange to proceed as required by article 118 of the 1949 Geneva Convention.
Since the last session of the General Assembly significant developments have been taking place in Central America, raising the prospect of peace in that region. It is our firm conviction that the Esquipulas- II Agreements remain the most viable basis for bringing peace to the region. We therefore support the efforts of the five leaders of Central America and urge all parties to exercise the necessary political will aid restraint, which alone can give the peace arrangements the chance to work.
The current wave of international peace has also washed the African shore. The peace treaty signed on Thursday, 31 August, between Libya aid Chad, ending their 16-year-old conflict, reflects the happy turn of events an the continent. We welcome the peace efforts in Angola and Mozambique. We continue to watch with much in sorest the ongoing consultations on the planned referendum on Western Sahara, whose people cannot be denied their legitimate aspirations indefinitely.
The situation in southern Africa, however, continues to be a matter of deep concern. The brutal repression send harassment of the members of the mass democratic movement protesting against the sham all-white elections held on 6 September should make all those who see the end of apartheid in South Africa's cost to peace overtures sit back aid think again. The racist regime has not, despite its recent declarations and overtures, shown any willingness to move in the direction of real justice for the black majority. The racist regime continues to fund and direct the Mozambique National Resistance (MNR) to ravage Mozambican peasants and workers. It also continues to provide weapons to the UNITA bandits to undermine the efforts for peace in Angola. It has through trickery and treachery sought to rig the Namibian elections, in flagrant disregard of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The verdict of the Security Council contained in its unanimous resolution 640 (1989), adapted in August, has clearly exposed the contradiction between what South Africa preaches and what it actually does. There is a need, therefore, for the international community to remain vigilant aid maintain its pressure on the racist regime.
Our oft-stated position, in the light of the worsening situation, is that South Africa must lift the state of emergency immediately and unconditionally, release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and detainees, lift the ban on all political organizations and opponents of apartheid, commence meaningful negotiations with genuine black leaders on ending apartheid, halt the carnage in Mozambique and Angola caused by its surrogate organization, and cease military aggression against its neighbours in order to end apartheid and bring peace and security to the area. Until that is done, comprehensive mandatory sanctions should be imposed on the racist regime by the international community.
In conclusion, we must stress that the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries remains an urgent matter for solution by the international community. It calls for a realistic approach which fully reflects the spirit of interdependence and international co-operation which has emerged in dealing with political issues.
Ghana welcomes the commendable efforts by the United Nations in the discharge of its role of promoting peace, social progress and better standards of life for peoples throughout the world. As we enter a new decade, this role will become even more important. The United Nations requires the co-operation of all Member States in the years ahead in dealing with its daunting tasks. The people and Government of Ghana stand ready to play their part.
","The rescheduling of unmet obligations or the provision of funds to pay accrued interests, which have been the hallmark of debt management strategies, have only postponed current obligations and made debt-servicing burdens over the years even more onerous. When the multilateral financial institutions which were created to assist countries in meeting their short aid long-term resource needs become net recipients of resources even from debt distressed developing countries in a region like Africa, it is a clear failure of international policy. The various facilities aid programmes established for the purpose of enhancing the lending capacities of the Bretton Woods institutions, such as the World Bank's special programme of assistance to support concessionary co-financing and the Fund's structural adjustment and enhanced structural adjustment facilities, have not been adequate to stem the tide of reverse transfer of resources to these institutions, particularly the Fund. We urge all the parties to exercise maximum flexibility in order to resolve their outstanding differences..
On the Middle East, Ghana continues to support the call for an international peace conference under the auspices of the united Nations, to be attended by all parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), to deal with the problems of Palestinian rights aid secure boundaries for all States in the region. Our oft-stated position, in the light of the worsening situation, is that South Africa must lift the state of emergency immediately and unconditionally, release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and detainees, lift the ban on all political organizations and opponents of apartheid, commence meaningful negotiations with genuine black leaders on ending apartheid, halt the carnage in Mozambique and Angola caused by its surrogate organization, and cease military aggression against its neighbours in order to end apartheid and bring peace and security to the area."
44,1989,GIN,"ï»¿
It is a pleasure for roe once again to extend to the. Assembly the warm and friendly greetings of the Republic of Guinea and of its President, General Lansana Conte.
Your election, Sir, to preside over the current session augurs well for success in our work, thanks to your great diplomatic experience and your outstanding personal qualities, which fit you very well for your high office. You are the representative of a continent constantly struggling for the advent of a new world order. Your country, Nigeria, is noted for its dynamic commitment to peace and progress. Moreover, we hardly need recall that Africa's economic charter, approved in April 1S80, bears the title of 'the Lagos Plan of Action'. I assure you of my delegation's full co-operation as you discharge your mandate.
I also wish to pay a well deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, who presided ably and competently over the forty-third session. My delegation would also pay a tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his courageous and tireless work for peace and for understanding between peoples.
While welcoming the positive changes in international relations in recent years, we have to note that some political crises persist in the world. We are concerned about the situation in southern Africa, Palestine, the occupied Arab territories, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Cambodia.
In southern Africa, in just under two months the future of Namibia will be decided when elections are held in the Territory. In that connection, my country condemns Pretoria's delaying tactics to hinder the proper implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Because of those tactics, the Security Council must shoulder its responsibility for the full implementation of that resolution.
Effective action must begin with the demobilization of the troops integrated into the South African police - in particular, the notorious Koevoet, set up to be veritable commandos of death and terror in Namibia.
I repeat my country's unconditional support for the South West Africa People's Organization. We hope that the courageous people of Namibia will soon see the dawn of an era of regained freedom and true independence.
In South Africa itself, the racist Pretoria regime's 12-month extension of the state of emergency is further proof of that regime's disregard for our Organization's resolutions and decisions. Neither the spectacular departure of Mr. Botha nor the fancy diplomatic footwork of his successor can hide the omnipresence of apartheid. There are still restrictions on the press, and arbitrary arrest of the regime's political opponents is the daily lot of the people of South Africa.
The mockery of elections that exclude 75 per cent of the population exposes the stubborn, racist nature of an increasingly condemned system. Those elections are not only contrary to the legal norms of the United Nations, but flagrantly violate the right of the South African people freely to decide their own future on the basis of the principle of one person, one vote.
Meanwhile, support for the African National Congress of South Africa, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and all those others that are fighting the anachronistic system of apartheid must become more real, and international action to increase awareness of the problem must be continued and intensified.
The Government of Guinea endorses the recommendations of the latest Summit of the non-aligned countries, held in Belgrade from 4 to 8 September this year, which called on the international community to take concerted action to compel the apartheid regime to answer for its crimes against mankind.
Pretoria is pushing its arrogance even further beyond the limits, by stepping up its acts of aggression and destabilization against the front-line and other neighbouring States. That State terrorism has led to disturbing population movements in the region, jeopardizing the economic and social balance. I therefore repeat the appeal made in the Oslo Declaration of August 1988 on humanitarian aid to States suffering so much from that scourge.
Elsewhere on the continent we should support the commendable efforts of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and all others of good will to establish conditions favourable to a climate of peace in Chad, Angola, Ethiopia, Sudan and Mozambique. My Government supports this peace process, which is based on dialogue, the search for agreement and mediation.
We also have hopes of a final settlement of the question of Western Sahara, through the holding of the self-determination referendum.
The talks now under way between France and the Comoros reflect the willingness of the two parties to reach a just solution to the question of the Comorion island of Mayotte.
As for Lebanon, my Government appreciates the responsible role being played by the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State with the aim of putting an end to the unspeakable suffering of the people of Lebanon caused by the civil war.
The question of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East crisis. Therefore, any viable solution must involve the following factors: Israel's total withdrawal from all the occupied territories, including Jerusalem; the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people - particularly its right to a homeland; recognition of the State of Palestine and the peace initiative of President Yasser Arafat; and, finally, the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all the parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal footing.
Guinea welcomes the cease-fire in the conflict between Iran and Iraq, and urges the two parties, under the auspices of the United Nations, to move their positions beyond the current situation of no war, no peace, and to establish an atmosphere of good neighbourliness, in keeping with Security Council resolution 598 (1987).
Despite the meagre results of the Paris Conference on Cambodia, consultations must continue with a view to establishing more favourable conditions for the resumption and eventual success of the work of that Conference. The dialogue that has begun between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union will certainly help to ease the situation.
Despite the withdrawal of foreign troops, the fighting has become even more deadly in Afghanistan, so there is an urgent need fully to implement the letter and spirit of the Geneva Agreements, including providing increased food aid to the Afghan refugees and ensuring their repatriation and their speedier reintegration into society.
With regard to New Caledonia, the Matignon Agreements, signed in Paris on 26 June 1988 by all the parties, marked an important stage towards the realization by the New Caledonian people of their aspirations.
Only respect for territorial integrity and national unity can help bring about peace in Cyprus and the Korean peninsula. The Korean people is waging a legitimate struggle, worthy of our full support, for the peaceful reunification of its country, without outside interference.
Similarly, we support the current negotiations between the Cypriot Government and the Turkish community, under the auspices or the Secretary-General.
The situation in Central America is also a matter of serious concern. My Government welcomes the efforts of the Heads of State of the region, and of other Latin American countries, to achieve a final agreement, in keeping with the spirit of the Esquipulas II and Tela meetings.
In opening this session on 19 September 1989, which was also the International Day of Peace - and peace is so very dear to mankind - the international community's intention was, in our view, to urge all those of good will to ensure that this year again we shall add one more stone to the fine house we are called upon to erect together. At no time in the past 40 years has peace been so near at hand than it is now. After having been threatened for so long by antagonistic ideologies, chauvinism and passion, peace is now looming on the horizon, not as the light at sunset but as the light of the sun rising inevitably towards the zenith.
That is why the Government of Guinea is convinced of the following: disarmament is the business of all States; nuclear disarmament is still the priority, but conventional disarmament should also be accorded the importance it warrants; the creation and extension of nuclear-weapon-free zones strengthens security; chemical weapons must be eliminated; there is a symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development, since the resources freed by disarmament can be used for economic and social progress.
While most speakers have shown a certain optimism with regard to the resolution of many political crises, the same cannot be said with regard to economic matters. The main feature of con temporary international relations is interdependence between political stability and economic progress. The North-South dialogue our countries have so much yearned for is still deadlocked. In the meantime, the gap between the rich countries and the other countries is widening, as is clearly shown by the persistence of the current world economic crisis.
Arbitrary prices for commodities and for goods manufactured by the North completely negates measures that are being put forward to ease the foreign-debt-servicing burden. Trade is carried out in a discriminatory manner. Our countries still do not have access to modern science and technology. Financial flows to the South are becoming increasingly rare while paradoxically, the North is accentuating the factors responsible for the continued financial bleeding of the South. With regard to the question of debt, indebtedness continues to absorb the fruit of the efforts of the poor countries, in particular in Africa, where the income is falling significantly in spite of the harsh measures taken in structural adjustments. While some creditor countries have agreed to forgive official debt - for which my country expresses its sincere gratitude - it is nevertheless clear that the solution to the economic crisis rests mainly on promoting remunerative prices for commodities.
It is fitting to emphasize that the critical economic and social situation in the countries of the South - aggravated in the case of some by a growing influx of refugees and displaced persons - is not conducive to ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights called for by the international community as a whole.
The various United Nations development decades have not yielded significant results. Hence, it is essential to prepare the kind of international strategy that will allow us to see the light at the end of the tunnel. In this regard, the convening in September 1990 of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and the holding in April 1990 of the special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation, as well as the implementation of a strategy within the context of the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, will provide added impetus to efforts for the establishment of a new international economic order. Environmental degradation is today a reality that can only be dealt with at a world-wide level. Deforestation, gaps in the ozone layer, pollution and natural disasters have all overwhelmed the ecosystem and endangered life.
My delegation recognizes that the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme have already begun to study climatic change through the setting up of an intergovernmental working group. We also support the strengthening of the programme on climatology already in place. We believe that in so doing we will help avoid the fragmentation of research in this area at a time of international economic difficulties.
On the question of toxic wastes, the cross-border transport and dumping of such wastes has negative effects on development and on the environment that call for a greater awareness and the speedy adoption of a world convention.
With regard to human rights, let me point out that in my country we say that the human face of. poverty, despair and ignorance is often that of the woman, the innocent child, the old person living alone or the handicapped person without resources. Hence my Government clearly sees the right to development as a specific human right. That is why the Military Committee for National Recovery believes that eliminating material poverty, social inequality and ignorance is the sine qua non for promoting human rights. As far as the Republic of Guinea is concerned, freedom, whether it be individual or collective, either is or is not; it must be seen as a whole, as an essential benefit that cannot be either negotiated or forfeited. It is the most valuable resource God has given to man.
Accordingly, the national authorities have advocated that international legal instruments on human rights be included in the domestic legal system of our country through the adoption of legislation.
There is a phenomenon today that has assumed unmanageable proportions: I refer to the problem of drugs and psychotropic substances about which the alarm has sounded in many countries. There is no doubt that the use of such substances is injurious to health and corrupts the youth, which is the most vulnerable sector of the population and the hope and the future of human society.
The struggle against this endemic evil necessarily involves international co-operation in stopping the production and consumption of drugs and their illicit trafficking. The example of the United States of America aid Colombia is one that could well be followed. It is the concrete expression of an active solidarity that is essential if we are to erect an impregnable barrier against this scourge.
I new turn to terrorism. Whether it be by an individual or a group of individuals, or the deliberate policy of a State, terrorism is criminal, and the Guinean Government condemns it most vigorously. Because terrorism threatens or kills innocent persons aid undermines international security, there cannot be any moral justification for it. Furthermore, it cannot become a tool in the legitimate struggle waged by peoples for freedom and emancipation.
The preservation of peace and the struggle for progress requires democratisation in international relations. Hence we must step up the role and influence of this world Organization while ensuring respect for and the promotion of the norms of international law. We must also take a fresh look at the challenges before us, in particular the economic challenge.
It is encouraging to see that the United Nations is now reviewing its role and doing its utmost to discharge its historic mission. The world is changing quickly and the United Nations cannot stand aloof. Its effectiveness depends on how it can adapt to the realities of the twenty-first century - that is to say, its ability to conceive a strategy in keeping with a universality that is its essential character is tic.
Today the trend on the part of us all is towards greater love for our fellow man, for the earth and for the heavens, and we must all resolutely look towards the future for the advent of a new world, young and beautiful, based on justice, freedom, prosperity and peace.
","Those elections are not only contrary to the legal norms of the United Nations, but flagrantly violate the right of the South African people freely to decide their own future on the basis of the principle of one person, one vote. Therefore, any viable solution must involve the following factors: Israel's total withdrawal from all the occupied territories, including Jerusalem; the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people - particularly its right to a homeland; recognition of the State of Palestine and the peace initiative of President Yasser Arafat; and, finally, the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all the parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal footing.

44,1989,GBR,"ï»¿
Let me first, if I my, sir, add my congratulations to those you have already received on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The first country .that I ever lived and worked in outside my own was Nigeria - in Jos, your home town - and I have a very great affection for the country and for its citizens. I wish you the greatest possible success in your presidency. I wish also to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, and to pay a tribute to the tireless work of the Secretary-General throughout the past year.
Fifty years ago this month, war began in Europe and spread throughout the world. Fifty-five million people died. The landscape of international relations was profoundly changed. That war inspired the creation of this Organization. The United Nations, conceived out of war, was the best framework our predecessors could devise for law, for order, and for peace. Hopes for it then were high, but they did not last. Even as the General Assembly was meeting for the first time, in London, divisions were opening between the two halves of Europe. The peoples of the East, for whom my country went to war, found that victory had been secured at an appalling price. They had won the peace, but they had lost their freedom. That division of Europe and that loss of freedom imposed a polarity on world affairs which has bedevilled international politics for over 40 years. Today, I am struck by the enormous and cheering contrast with those times. I believe that the feeling of hope and opportunity in world affairs is greater today than at any time since the Assembly first met, in London, my home town. 
The hopes of the early days have been revived. Ideologies have become less Potent: it is less and less relevant to talk of Easiest, or North-South, or the first, second, third or even fourth worlds. Instead, we should talk of a world whose nation States have reciprocal rights, responsibilities and obligations. There is only one world. We all share in it and must make of it what we can. Today, the opportunities for the United Nations to make good use of that fine framework for law, order and peace I spoke of have suddenly become real. There are new problems that we must face together. We have moved from cold war to global warming. Fresh ideas and attitudes are changing the face of the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe. I agree with Mr. Shevardnadze that it is in the interests of all of us for perestroika to succeed.
Liberty is reasserting itself in Poland and in Hungary and is drawing thousands of Germans from East to West. The cold war is ending where it started. Even the Berlin Wall cannot stem the exodus of people seeking a new life in freedom. No one doubts, I think, that we are only at the beginning of a long and difficult process. Patience and goodwill are necessary on a11 sides. Yesterday, Mr. Shevardnadze offered an authoritative Soviet view of recent events in Poland. I warmly welcome his remarks. I hope and believe that in making them he was burying, once and for all, the so-called Brezhnev doctrine, which was used to justify the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. with freedom no longer seen as a threat, there is a real opportunity to build a new Europe.
The first priority for East-West relations must be to support and encourage the process of reform which is now under way. That will reinforce trust and confidence. A co-ordinated approach, including very substantial economic support, is essential. The European Community has made clear its readiness to play its full part, with both short- and long-term measures. Both will be needed. The challenge is to work in partnership with others to bring about a Community of Europe, to stand alongside the Community in Europe. The goal is a Europe of peace, prosperity and freedom, where the terms East and west have more to do with geography than with politics - a Europe without enforced divisions, whose people are at liberty to determine their own future.
Increasing trust will assist the process of arms control. Success in this field is a priority. For the past 40 years the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has resolutely maintained the peace in Europe. Now it is taking new opportunities to consolidate that peace. NATO countries have tabled far-reaching conventional arms proposals. Their aim is clears it is enhanced security at equal and lower levels of forces in Europe. More peace at less cost is an attractive bargain for everyone.
We are encouraged by the steps agreed upon between the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve faster progress towards an early START agreement. The proposed 50 per cent cuts in their nuclear arsenals will make a major contribution to international security and stability.
We are working also for the achievement of a global chemical weapons ban. I warmly welcome the proposals made by President Bush on Monday and the positive Soviet response to them. The reduction of United States and Soviet stockpiles ahead of a convention will do much to reassure countries that do not possess chemical weapons and will also remove the rationale for other countries to cling to their stocks. It is through practical steps like these that Governments can best show their determination to get rid of these gruesome weapons. My country gave up its chemical weapons 30 years ago. We look forward to other countries destroying theirs.
We should look also for a way to give more impetus and focus to the Geneva negotiations on chemical weapons. Today I propose one way to do this: let us move from the present intermittent pattern of negotiations to round-the-year meetings, as already happens in other areas of arms control. We can also be encouraged by the progress that has been made towards the resolution of regional conflicts in different parts of the world. In Namibia the international community, and the united Nations in particular, has shown what co-operation can achieve. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is more than a decade old, but its principles have remained valid. That in turn has opened the way to Namibian independence.
The Namibian independence process is the direct responsibility of the United Nations and the Secretary-General personally, since we met last year, there has been major progress towards implementation of the United Nations plan. Now, as Namibia's elections draw near, it is vital for all of us to give our full support to the Secretary-General and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). All the parties involved must show restraint, particularly in the face of provocation, such as the recent murder of Anton Lubowski. Violence and intimidation will serve only those who wish to deny Namibia its freedom.
But Namibia will need help after independence as well. Britain will Play a full part in that effort. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting next month we shall also be considering what help the Commonwealth can provide. Next year, I hope, a free, independent Namibia will have taken its place in the Assembly and also, I trust, as a welcome new member of the Commonwealth. 
Fighting still continues in Angola and in Mozambique, but there is now some movement towards peace in both of those countries. I urge both sides in Angola to restore the cease-fire and to resume negotiations on the basis of the common ground identified in June. For our part, we shall continue to give full support to President Chissano's efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement with Renamo. We call upon the new South African Government to support those efforts in the letter and spirit of the Nkomati accord. That means making sure that no support - no support - goes from South Africa to Renamo.
South Africa remains the key to lasting stability in that region. In the recent elections, 70 per cent of the white-minority electorate voted for change. One hundred per cent of the black population, denied a vote, are calling urgently for change. Mr. de Klerk campaigned from a platform of reform. He committed himself to work for a new South Africa, in which all the people would be fully represented. He made a clear declaration of intent. There is now a clear mandate. Now the declaration and the mandate must be turned into action.
Of one thing I am sure. Apartheid cannot survive and it does not deserve to survive. It is not something to be tolerated or to be patient with, it is something to oppose constantly and comprehensively. 
Violence is not the answer. Nor are economic sanctions. They weigh the possibility of change against the certainty of immediate, lasting hardship to the black community whose growing economic muscle is already contributing to the erosion of apartheid.
No. The answer to apartheid is unremitting political pressure on South Africa to reform itself, wise policy lies in assistance and support for the innocent victims of apartheid within South Africa - political prisoners and township dwellers alike. It lies also in support for the economies of South Africa's neighbours and help for them to defend themselves against attempts at destabilization. Positive action, constructive action - action in which Britain's record is second to none and will remain so.
 Many brave men and women in South Africa have struggled peacefully and Persistently against apartheid. If I single out Helen Suzman, it is because, for 40 years, often alone in the South African Parliament, often in the face of threats and intimidation, she fought for freedom. She is in London today. I am pleased to tell the Assembly that she will be honoured by Her Majesty the Queen with one of our highest awards for all she has done in the campaign for justice. In her name, Britain will be funding a new scholarship scheme, soon bringing to 1,000 the number of our annual scholarships for black South Africans.  The new Government in South Africa must now move quickly and unambiguously to meet its commitment to fundamental reform. A new and just society cannot be constructed overnight. But we are clear what should happen. We want to see the release of detainees, the lifting of the state of emergency, the suspension of violence and a dialogue with black leaders to consider and to implement the changes that must be made.  I hope that the United Nations will be ready to respond appropriately to clear and practical signs of change. But signs there must be. That should be our common message to South Africa's leaders.
Since we last met, my country and Argentina have taken significant steps towards achieving a more normal relationship, in doing so, the two countries have agreed to set the question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands on one side. Following preliminary talks here in August, both sides will be meeting again in Madrid this month. For our part, we shall work hard to ensure the success of the process which has now begun. It will not be easy. And our ambitions should not be set too high too soon. But we enter these negotiations hoping for agreement. In the Middle East, the resolutions which are the core of the search for peace are now nearly a generation bid. Another generation of refugees and dispossessed people has new been added to what is first and foremost a human tragedy.
Last year's renunciation of terrorism by the PLO and its willingness to recognize Israel were a major breakthrough. I hope that Israel will come to recognize that. The Israeli Government's proposal for elections in the occupied territories is a positive step too. I hope the PLO will come to recognize that. I pay tribute to the efforts of President Mubarak in taking these ideas forward. Elections must be part of a process leading to final status negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We believe that the best framework for these negotiations is an international conference under United Nations auspices.
In Lebanon, we have witnessed for years a process of national self-destruction. Now it seems there is a glimmer of hope. We have welcomed and supported the efforts of the Arab League Committee of Three. They offer a bridge to peace. We hope all concerned in Lebanon's conflict will cross it. A particular threat hangs over the hostages in Lebanon. They are the victims of a detestable form of blackmail which threatens the entire international community.
It is hard to appreciate the anguish of those held hostage, although I have seen the suffering of some of their families, and seen, too, their courage and determination, which is remarkable. John McCarthy, Terry Waite, and now Jackie Mann, three British hostages, have been held for a total of more than 2,000 days. We must keep them and the other hostages constantly in the public eye. They most not be forgotten or overlooked. We must make every effort to press for their unconditional release. There are countries with influence on the hostage-takers. They should use that influence without delay to secure the hostages, safe release, state terrorism is no more acceptable through agents than carried out directly.  It is time to return the hostages to their families, and that should be the message from this Assembly.  
Upon one further Point we must all be clear. We must and we dare not give in to the blackmail of terrorists. The Security Councils resolution on terrorism last July added the authority of this Organisation to that message. We need to work for the wide adoption of specific counter-measures. After horrific bombing of Pan Am night 103, the United Kingdom, with Czechoslovakia. is seeking an international agreement on the marking of explosives. All of us are naturally concerned at inflict or tension between countries, or within countries. A number of instates were raised on behalf of European Community countries by my colleague, Roland Dumas. yesterday. I would single out only one, Burma, where  here is an urgent need for the restoration of human rights and democracy through free elections. Earlier this year millions of us around the world were shocked to see Chinese troops kill and wound their fellow citizens on the orders of their own Government. 
The measures that we have taken in response to those events are not. however, intended to isolate China. We hope to see China return to genuine reform and to repair the damage done to its international relations. No Government can survive indefinitely by the suppression of peaceful dissent. By treaty. Hong Kong will revert to China in 1997. By treaty, Hong Kong will also preserve its traditional freedoms and way of life. That treaty, the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, is binding. It has been registered as such at the United Nations by both Britain and China.
I welcome unreservedly China's reaffirmation of its commitment to the Joint Declaration. Britain is likewise committed, bindingly and whole-heartedly. But our common commitment must now be reflected in action. And practical reassurances are required from China to the people of Hong Kong, so that they may feel secure in their future, both up to 1997 and beyond. Hong Kong is resilient. Its economy continues to thrive. But it will take time, steady nerves and, above all, an explicitly supportive attitude on the part of China to restore Hong Kong's confidence in its future.
For our part, Britain will continue vigorously to represent the interests of Hong Kong's people in our discussions with China, we intend also to introduce concrete measures to reassure people in the territory about their future. They include-, the early introduction of a Bill of Rights; the development of more representative government; and a package to encourage people essential to Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity to stay there, by giving them guarantees of resettlement in Britain if they wish. That package will be designed not to strip Hong Kong of its people, but to give them hope and confidence to remain in Hong Kong. 
	Hong Kong's continued confidence and success is in the interest of the entire international community. In return, Hong Kong needs international understanding and support. That was recognized by the Paris economic summit, and I hope it will also be recognized by this Assembly. International understanding and support is also required in response to the intractable problem of the Vietnamese boat people.
The continuing human exodus from Viet Nam has imposed an insuperable burden on Places of first asylum in the region. Hong Kong alone has more than 56,000 boat people in its camps-, over 32,000 of them have arrived this year.
Yet the bleak reality is that for most of these people there are no homes to go to outside their own country. They are not political refugees. Under the criteria laid down by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, they have left Viet Nam for economic reasons, and not under political pressure.  In June, at Geneva, the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees agreed that: 'Persons determined not to be refugees should return to their country of origin in accordance with international practices reflecting the responsibility of States towards their own citizens.' That is surely the only answer. Alas, there is no room for them in Hong Kong. There is no hope of a home in any new country. The existing situation is, therefore, unsustainable.
The international community knows that it cannot simply leave this problem with Hong Kong in the hope that somehow they will cope. They cannot cope. The Government and the people of Hong Kong have done all they can. They have put up 15 camps. They have provided food, clothing, schooling. But the limit of their capacity to help has been reached.
For those boat people who are genuine refugees, homes are being found in countries around the world. That is as it should be. But for those boat people who are not refugees, there can ultimately be only one home: the one they came from, so far, only a few of them have recognized this and volunteered to return. We look to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to step up counselling of the non-refugees to ensure that more of them know that there is no future for them outside their own country.
In mid-October, the international community will review developments since the Geneva Conference. The main purpose must be to agree a programme of repatriation under the good offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That must involve the phased, orderly and monitored return and re-integration in safety and dignity of all those who are not genuine refugees. To achieve that, Viet Nam must assume full responsibility for its own people and co-operate in the programme. We shall work in good faith with the Vietnamese authorities to that end.
The world that many of us grew up in was haunted by memories of war and overshadowed by the threat of nuclear destruction. Yet, for many of us, it was a much more innocent world than today. Our parents did not live in fear that their children could be exposed to the lethal menace of drugs. We as parents today can have no such peace of mind.
That is why the town of Medellin is now a household name throughout the world. That is why Colombia's battle against drugs is a battle on behalf of us all. The power of the traffickers transcends national boundaries. It demands an international response. I can announce today that, following discussions with the Colombian authorities, my Government has approved a substantial package of assistance for Colombia. It draws on our experience in fighting terrorism. It will comprise communications and towards equipment, technical assistance, and training for those in Colombia involved in the anti-drugs campaign. However, it is vital to make intensified efforts to reduce demand in consumer countries - to put the traders in human misery out of business. Britain will be hosting, in close co-operation with the United Nations, a major international conference in London next April to tackle the problems of demand reduction and cocaine.
The United Nations already makes a significant contribution to international efforts to combat the drugs menace. But we must all do more. All states should ratify the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Britain will do so and has also signed nine agreements so far with other countries permitting the tracing and confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers. The world in which many of us grew up was also a more ignorant world. Pew then appreciated the fragility of the environment which sustains life. But today, if ever there was an issue that should unite the nations, it is this one. To meet this global challenge we need stronger international institutions and clearer priorities. 
That is why Britain has more than doubled its voluntary financial contribution to the United Nations Environment Programme. That is why Britain called in May for the early negotiation of an international convention on climate change. And that is why Britain is active in helping to protect tropical forests, whose importance in terms of both climate and resources is now far better understood. The priorities of preservation must live alongside the priorities of development and economic growth. A balance has to be struck. Our philosophy has to be sustainable development, development that benefits mankind and protects his environment. Partnership is a new watchword for the relationship between developed and developing countries. The priorities for that partnership are clear. In the first instance it must be for developing countries themselves to pursue sound economic policies. But development aid has an important part to play. So does action by creditor countries to relieve the debt burden on countries pursuing reform, and most especially on the poorest. International trade must be kept open and inflation contained to assist growth. Britain will continue to work for progress in all those areas.
Experience has shown us that focusing tightly and in turn on the key issues is a better approach than looking for generalized global solutions. The international community, with the United Nations as its chosen instrument, faces a formidable range of challenges. But they are matched by opportunities. The demands on the United Nations are growing. But so is its prestige. So is its authority. So too is the extent of its engagement in new areas.
As we recall the conflict which created the United Nations, it is reassuring to find the Organization developing its role so successfully today. With the membership's continued support the process can be taken further still. All of us will gain from that. For, as the then British Prime Minister told the very first session of the General Assembly:  'The United Nations is really a coming together of all peoples in all countries and continents. It is not 'them' - it is; every one of us seeking, as citizens of the world, peace and security for humanity.' Now, at last, we cure doing just that.
","We call upon the new South African Government to support those efforts in the letter and spirit of the Nkomati accord. The answer to apartheid is unremitting political pressure on South Africa to reform itself, wise policy lies in assistance and support for the innocent victims of apartheid within South Africa - political prisoners and township dwellers alike. International understanding and support is also required in response to the intractable problem of the Vietnamese boat people. So does action by creditor countries to relieve the debt burden on countries pursuing reform, and most especially on the poorest. As we recall the conflict which created the United Nations, it is reassuring to find the Organization developing its role so successfully today."
44,1989,ISR,"ï»¿The United Nations was founded by the nations that had fought and won the most terrible war mankind has known - a war against racism, fascism, and man's inhumanity to man. This war began with Hitler's onslaught on Poland.
Fifty years ago this week, after intense fighting, the German army entered Warsaw, it was the inevitable outcome of the agreement reached at Munich a year earlier, in which Britain and France surrendered to Hitler's demands and sacrificed democratic Czechoslovakia in the name of self-determination and for the sake of what they thought was 'peace in our time'.
The month of September 1939 marked the beginning of the greatest and most terrible war known to mankind. That war will for ever be associated with the Holocaust - the systematic attempt by Nazi Germany to annihilate the Jewish people. Six million Jews - almost all of Europe's Jews - were murdered, first by being starved, beaten and shot to death, and later by being gassed in industrialized murder factories designed and installed for the express purpose of mass murder of Jews at Auschwitz, Majdanek, Treblinka, Sobibor, Dachau, Bergen-Belsen and other now infamous sites. Wherever the German army reached, no Jewish community escaped. In every town and village occupied by the Wehrmacht scarcely any Jews survived.
At first, no one knew; and then no one believed. And then when it was already known in the capitals of the Allied Powers that day by day thousands of Jews - men, women and children - were being put to death, nothing was done to help. Many still prefer to believe that nothing could have been done - that the German army was too powerful, the Allies too weak, the distances too great. But now we know. Much could have been done; many could have been saved. In April of 1943, the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto revolted. A handful of men and women, almost unarmed, facing impossible odds, they held out against the German army for one whole month. At that time, von Paulus' army had already been crushed at Stalingrad, Rommel had been defeated in the Western Desert and Allied armies had landed in North Africa. Allied forces were bombing the cities of Germany by day and night. The Allies were winning the war on land, at sea, and in the air.
But no help, not even a sign of encouragement, was extended to the Jewish fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto.
It was in the two following years, leading up to the Nazi surrender, that the Nazi murder machine moved into high gear and millions of Jews were murdered. In the closing months of the war in Europe, while the German army was reeling in defeat on all fronts, the crematoria continued to devour their victims. It was during the very last months of the war that Hungarian Jewry perished.
Many of those Jews who succeeded to escape Hitler's Europe and tried to reach the shores of Palestine were turned back to certain death.
The Holocaust, the murder of six million by Nazi Germany and its henchmen, the abandonment of the Jews by the rest of the world, remains engraved forever in the heart and soul of mankind.
In November 1947, the Holocaust still a vivid memory, the United Nations General Assembly reaffirmed a decision taken by the League of Nations 26 years earlier. Then the League had given international recognition to the Zionist movement and its goal - the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. In 1947, the United Nations called for the establishment of the Jewish State in a fraction of the territory originally designated for this purpose by the League of Nations.
That decision was rejected by the Arab world, just as the Arab world had over the years consistently denied the rights of the Jewish people in their ancient
homeland. As the British Mandate expired on 15 May 1948 and Israel's independence was declared, Israel was invaded by the armies of the surrounding Arab States. In those days, Israel stood alone, 650,000 Jews fighting for their lives only a few years after Europe had been turned into a Jewish graveyard. Israel had no choice but to win that war, just as it had to win four succeeding wars launched against it by the surrounding Arab countries.
The United Nations resolution of 1947 is today part of Israel's history, an expression of support for Zionism - the right of the Jewish people to their own State in their ancient homeland. But in 1975, the United Nations General Assembly, greatly enlarged, but unfortunately not grown in moral stature, adopted the infamous 'Zionism is racism' resolution that makes a sham of the United Nations resolution adopted 2 8 years earlier, and that continues to this day to be a stain on the record of the Organization. As long as this resolution is not revoked, no moral authority can accompany United Nations decisions, and an air of hypocrisy continues to envelop its debates.
Israel has learned to be in the minority at the United Nations, just as we have learned to exist in the dangerous environment of the Middle East. We live in a constant state of alert, allocating a great part of our resources to defence, determined to fight terrorism and ward off aggression.
Some say that this is paranoia - a paranoia engendered by the Holocaust, the Jews still living in fear of their very existence, preparing to defend themselves against imaginary enemies. But is this really a figment of Israel's imagination? The Arab armies surrounding Israel maintain an inventory of modern weaponry - tanks, aircraft, missiles, artillery - larger than all the weaponry of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. During the past decade, military equipment valued at about 100 billion dollars was purchased by the countries of that area. We
ask ourselves, why is this weaponry there, most of it directed against Israel? Is it possible that these weapons might be used against Israel, and against Israel's civilian population?
We have already experienced five wars? we have lost thousands of our sons in Israel's defence. We see around us a Middle East that is brutal and fanatic, where no mercy is shown even to civilians. A million soldiers were killed in the Iraqi-Iranian war, where the most modern weapons of mass destruction were applied, including chemical warfare used on a massive scale by the Iraqi army. The universal agreement against the use of chemical warfare was broken not only in attacks against combatants, but also against Kurdish civilian villages. These outrages went almost unnoticed by the world, but not by us in Israel, remembering our own experience and knowing that Iraq is closer to Israel than New York is to Washington.
In recent months, the civilian population of Beirut and the Christian enclave north of Beirut were under fire from Syrian army artillery. The killing of innocent civilians went on day by day, the attackers gaining confidence that they can continue the killings with impunity. Is it then paranoia when Israel, in this environment and under these circumstances, feels itself threatened?
Are we aspiring to a needless luxury when we put forth the claim to secure and recognized boundaries? Are we wasting our resources when we maintain an army capable of defending ourselves? Are we imposing on the great nations of the world when we plead with them not to arm those of our neighbours that daily announce their hostility to Israel? Are we wrong when we ask that no encouragement be given to terrorists who in their war on Israel have committed some of the worst atrocities the world has seen since the Second World War? And yet Israel, embattled and beleaguered, continues in the quest for peace. Many of the Arab rulers seem to have no desire for peace with Israel, no matter what the conditions. Worse yet, it is the aim of these rulers to prevent others from making peace with us.
As a result, the peace process in the Middle East moves at a glacial pace. It took 30 years before Egypt reached out to meet Israel's outstretched hand - 30 years and five wars. Israel paid a tremendous price for the Israeli-Egyptian peace Treaty, a price unprecedented in the annals of conflict resolution between nations, with the signing of that Treaty 10 years ago, we had hoped that the other Arab States would quickly enter into negotiations with us, but this has not happened - at least not yet.
In May of 1983 we signed an agreement with Lebanon that would have normalized relations between our two countries and that entailed the withdrawal of the Israel Defence Forces from Southern Lebanon. But that agreement was scuttled by Syrian interference. They had other plans for Lebanon. Six years have passed and the Lebanese tragedy continues. Southern Lebanon is still a staging-ground for terrorist attacks by the PLO and the Hezbollah against the towns and villages on Israel's northern border.
This is the threatening nature of our environment, and we ignore it only at our peril. However, we will not resign ourselves to this cruel reality. We will leave no stone unturned in our quest for peace.
That is why, in April of this year, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir unveiled Israel's four-point peace initiative. We call for a common Israeli-Egyptian effort to build, on the foundations of the Camp David accords that brought about the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, a comprehensive peace for the Middle East. We call on the 20 Arab countries, at present in a state of war with Israel, to cease hostile propaganda and economic boycott and begin a process of normalizing their relations with Israel. We call on the international community of nations to participate in an effort to rehabilitate the Palestinian refugee camps in Judea, Samaria and Gaza.
We call on the Palestinian Arab population in Judea, Samaria and Gaza to cease acts of terrorism and violence, and we announce our readiness to hold free democratic elections so that they can choose their representatives for negotiations with Israel on an interim agreement and eventually on the terms of a permanent settlement. There is no alternative way to move the Middle Eastern peace process forward. Rejection of this initiative is synonymous with rejecting progress towards peace. We call on all nations to support Israel's peace initiative, and we call on the Arab world to respond favourably to it. This is not the time to attempt to
wring concessions from Israel that relate to the permanent settlement. Our immediate objective must be to put an end to violence and to get negotiations going. Putting the cart before the horse can only stall the process itself.
If the representatives of the Palestinian Arab population in Judea, Samaria and Gaza will come to the negotiating table cognizant not only of the rights and aspirations of the population that will have freely chosen them, but also aware of Israel's rights and legitimate concerns, there is an excellent chance that negotiations will lead to agreement. Moreover, the democratic experience not as yet prevalent in the Middle East will no doubt serve as an example to all nations of the region. That in itself will be an important contribution to peace in the area, because war and terrorism do not flourish in democratic societies. I urge all member nations of this Organization to lend their support to Israel's continuing efforts to end warfare and bloodshed in the Middle East.
I call on the representatives of Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen to utilize the opportunity of our presence at the United Nations General Assembly and to meet with me to discuss how we can move from belligerency to peace, and from hostility to friendship.
I call on the Palestinian Arab population in Judea, Samaria and Gaza to desist from violent acts and to make every effort to help establish the conditions that will permit the holding of free, democratic elections.
The peace process in the Middle East requires courage, patience and perseverance. We in Israel are dedicated to the peace process. We shall continue to pursue it despite all obstacles. We expect your support.
","But in 1975, the United Nations General Assembly, greatly enlarged, but unfortunately not grown in moral stature, adopted the infamous 'Zionism is racism' resolution that makes a sham of the United Nations resolution adopted 2 8 years earlier, and that continues to this day to be a stain on the record of the Organization.

44,1989,YUG,"ï»¿

 

It gives me pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, most cordially on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. As a representative of a prominent African country, friendly Nigeria, and as a person of vast diplomatic experience and wisdom, you are eminently qualified to preside over this Assembly.
At the same time, I wish to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, the representative of Argentina, for his very successful presidency of the forty-third session.
There are many reasons for which I should like to express special appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. I have primarily in mind his important contribution to seeking solutions to the most acute problems of the world during the past year.
His view of the present state of international relations and its reflection upon the position and role of the United Nations, presented in his annual report on the work of the Organization, is indeed noteworthy.
The Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries was recently held in Belgrade, the capital of my country. I trust that the Assembly shares our conviction that this was one of the major international events this year.
It is my great privilege and responsible duty to present to the Assembly the results of the Ninth Conference contained in the final documents and messages of that most important gathering of the non-aligned countries. I believe that in this way I shall contribute also to the consideration of the issues on the agenda of this year's General Assembly session.
The Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries adopted a Declaration as well as a number of separate documents on specific questions in the political and economic fields. The summit documents reflect the views of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on current developments in international relations, as well as its aspirations to contribute to these processes.
In the briefest possible terms, these views could be expressed as follows. After a long period of tension over the past few years the situation has started to change; world tensions are easing, and this is having a positive effect on the process of resolving some protracted world crises and problems.
 Basically what has been happening is what the non-aligned have always advocated, but the situation is still far from that which is desired. International relations today contain the characteristics of both the old and the new. Detente is far from being universal as wars are still being waged in many parts of the world. Political detente along East-West lines has not been followed by economic detente along North-South lines. The process of the pauperisation of the South is continuing, 'technological achievements can bring about vast improvements in the quality of life, but tragic destruction as well. While human rights are in some places a basic premise of living, elsewhere they are but a far-off objective.
In the assessment by the non-aligned countries, the world is at a crossroads. There may be an acceleration in the progressive development of the international community, but there may also be drastic retrogression.
In a world of growing interdependence, the non-aligned countries have expressed their readiness to bear their share of responsibility for resolving common problems. Accordingly they have opted for dealing also with those problems which are of growing concern to the entire international community, such as, for example, the issue of environmental protection and the drug problem.
For decades we have been opposing confrontations in the world, aware of the fact that problems can be resolved only through dialogue and co-operation. We are determined to co-operate with all other countries of the world to that end, confident that realism will prevail over prejudice and dogma.
In keeping with their views, in their Declaration the non-aligned countries highlighted several areas to which they assigned priority in their future work. The first priority is efforts to keep the peace, to achieve disarmament and to settle disputes by peaceful means.
The notion of security is not confined to its military component. Closely associated with disarmament are: the observance of the principles of the United Nations Charter; the peaceful settlement of disputes; economic development; and respect for all collective and individual human rights.
Now, when the veritable process of disarmament has finally been initiated, non-aligned countries continue to work for its strengthening and expansion. The  total elimination of nuclear weapons remains the primary objective. Yugoslavia, together with other non-aligned countries, gives top priority to a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. We also advocate the earliest possible adoption of a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and their elimination.
At the Ninth Summit Conference the non-aligned countries also emphasized their readiness to make their full contribution to the initiation and realization of the process of conventional disarmament at global, regional and sub regional levels.
I should like also to underline our full support for the central role and responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. Such a role would be further affirmed by the establishment of an integrated multilateral verification system under the auspices of the Organization.
The next priority is a common quest for effective and acceptable solutions to the problems of international economic relations.
In welcoming the positive changes in international relations the non-aligned countries at the Ninth Summit Conference pointed out that 'a detente devoid of economic content is unlikely to endure'. This specific assessment has been thoroughly elaborated: the ever-more-difficult position of developing countries whereby a majority of mankind is denied access to scientific and technological achievements is the major obstacle to global aspirations to integration on the basis of interdependence and equitable co-operation. Such a trend is not only an impediment to the faster and more-balanced development of the world economy as a whole, but also a latent threat to global peace and stability.
In their analysis the non-aligned countries have noted the complex changes taking place in the world economy; its increasing multipolarity; new technological breakthroughs; the strengthening of integration groupings world wide; and reforms in socialist countries. These changes have new potentials for development but their course is intricate and their outcome uncertain. There are also new dangers of processes closing in and excluding third parties.
However, practice increasingly is proving that the world economy is hard to manage on the basis of agreements reached in a narrow circle. The more favourable international political climate, the greater general awareness of interdependence and the years of relatively stable growth by developed countries could indeed be fertile ground for a new beginning in the North-South dialogue and co-operation.
The messages of the Ninth Summit Conference and the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 which preceded it unequivocally express the readiness of non-aligned and other developing countries jointly to seek effective and generally acceptable solutions to the key and interrelated problems of external debt, development, financing, trade, raw materials and technology, as well as to the specific and particularly acute problems weighing upon the least developed countries. We are convinced that today there are realistic conditions for establishing a new global development consensus and that this is an opportunity that the international community must not miss. I should like to point out that the external-debt problem of a considerable number of developing countries is one problem whose solution can no longer be postponed. 
The protracted economic stagnation of these countries and the constant outflow of capital, through external-debt servicing, to the economies of the developed countries cannot but have grave social and political effects on the debtor countries, as well as on the international community as a whole. 
We support the evolution in the position of creditors and the signs of their goodwill to approach this problem with more inventiveness, thus offering better prospects for its settlement, but we also wish to emphasize that it is necessary to deal with this problem in a more expedient and more efficient manner, in the interests of all.
We do not expect that solutions to all problems can be found here in the United Nations. It is necessary to combine action at national, regional and global levels. The specialized agencies and forums have a clearly defined role. However, it is from this universal and most democratic forum that the very necessary political impulse and guidelines should be given to ensure that all activities are coherent and conducive to the creation of conditions favourable for the more rapid inclusion of developing countries in the mainstream of the world economy. More fruitful communication and the reaching of agreement on a larger number of key economic and development issues would at the same time constitute the best guarantee of the success of the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly scheduled for April next year.
The imperative need for a new development consensus also requires the political engagement of countries at the highest level. Therefore, the idea of regular consultations between the leaders of the North and South is a timely one and deserves our full support.
The next important priority for the non-aligned countries is support for the right of all peoples living under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation to self-determination and independence. Stressing their commitment to the goal of complete eradication of colonialism, the non-aligned countries once again pledged to strengthen their solidarity with non-aligned and other countries facing aggression, intervention or interference in their internal affairs. 
The greatest remaining colonial problem, Namibia, is hopefully being brought to an end. The process of gaining independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which is now taking place and is the focus of the attention of the entire world public, represents a victory for long efforts made primarily within this Organization of ours to end the illegal occupation by South Africa. That process is now entering its final but most critical stage. It is our responsibility to prevent through resolute action all attempts to thwart the United Nations plan at the last moment. The people of Namibia must not be prevented from freely expressing their will at the elections.
To this end, in a special Declaration adopted at the ninth summit meeting, the non-aligned countries called upon the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations urgently to take a series of measures to counter all possible future violations of the United Nations plan. However, this time the non-aligned countries are also taking action themselves. Their fact-finding mission, which visited Namibia early in August, will return there to oversee the November elections and report immediately to the Movement. Together with its other actions of support and assistance to the Namibian people, now and in the future, and in keeping with its fundamental goals and priorities, the Non-Aligned Movement is thus demonstrating in practice its active solidarity with peoples in the process of gaining their freedom.
B
Consistent with the positions of the Movement, the Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries most strongly condemned the continuous existence of the system of apartheid and supported the continuation of all existing measures and the taking of new ones for its elimination. At the same time, by adopting the Harare Declaration of 21 August of the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), they supported the determination of the people of southern Africa to put an end to apartheid through peaceful means and  negotiation. That determination is fully in line with the current situation in international relations, and our Organization is in duty bound to use all its influence to prevent this courageous and wise move of the people of Africa from being frustrated. A historic responsibility now rests upon South Africa. The road towards peace and co-operation in the region or the road towards an eruption of revolt by the subjugated people and bloodied is the choice it has to make. All that is rational and humane in man tells us there cannot be, there must not be, a dilemma.
Other points of crisis and instability in the world also require our urgent and undivided attention. At this favourable moment, it is our responsibility, as Members of this Organisation, to use every avenue to bring about the successful completion, or at least the speeding up, of the processes that have been initiated for their (solution, or to restart them where they have come to a halt.
We believe that it is indeed high time that the statesmanlike and constructive position of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, be met with an equally worthwhile and constructive response on the part of other principal factors on whom the peace process in the Middle East depends. While welcoming every partial step which might bring that region closer to peace, we feel that the continuing opposition to the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the full participation of the PLO should be overcome as soon as possible. The vast majority of the countries of the world long ago expressed their support for this realistic way towards a comprehensive solution to the Middle East crisis, which would create the possibility for all countries in the region to live in safety and peace within their territories.
The tragic escalation of conflict further endangers the prospect of bringing unity, full sovereignty and territorial integrity to non-aligned Lebanon and prolongs the suffering of its people. Now is the time for all factors concerned to assist the continued efforts of the Arab Tripartite Committee which, enjoying the broadest support, could lead to a situation in which the vicious circle of violence might be broken and replaced by agreements.
A political solution to the problem of Afghanistan requires that the Geneva Agreements be consistently and completely implemented and that all their signatories and guarantors consistently abide by the letter and spirit of those Agreements. This would facilitate the opening of an intra-Afghan dialogue, aimed at establishing a broad-based Government comprising representatives of all segments of the people of Afghanistan.
Although this summer's conference on Cambodia in Paris did not yield a comprehensive solution, the momentum of diplomatic efforts must not be allowed to abate. Slow and laborious as it may be, the negotiating process is bringing certain results, strengthening hopes that conditions will soon be created for the people of Cambodia freely to determine their destiny. The withdrawal of foreign troops is certainly the most important step in that direction.
The recent peace agreement of the Presidents of five Central American countries concluded in Tela, Honduras, has, it is to be hoped, removed hindrances to the implementation of the Esquipulas II peace Agreement. Welcoming the actions of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States in support of international verification of the implementation of the peace Agreements, I wish to express our conviction that strict observance of those Agreements by all is essential for the achievement of lasting peace in the region.
The consistent and full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) remains the basis for achieving a comprehensive, just, honourable and durable settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq.
As regards Western Sahara, we are convinced that full co-operation by all parties with the United Nations Secretary-General and the Chairman of the OAU in their further efforts is essential if there is to be a just and definitive settlement. Despite all the difficulties, we believe that continuation of the Secretary-General's good offices and the inter-communal talks, in an atmosphere marked by an overall improvement in international relations, will lead finally to decisive breakthroughs in resolving the Cyprus problem. The way to the peaceful reunification of Korea is through dialogue and mutual confidence-building, in conformity with the principles of the 1972 North-South joint statement.
Next on the list of priorities of the non-aligned countries is the environmental protection problem. The dangers menacing the atmosphere, the seas and the forests today threaten all countries alike and dramatically highlight the interdependence of the contemporary world. Proceeding from that conviction, the non-aligned countries voiced their full readiness to contribute to the strengthening of global co-operation to protect and improve the environment. They also stressed that this objective can be realized only within the context of growth and development, and with the allocation of additional resources, giving developing countries access to ecologically cleaner technologies and making possible their active participation in global ecological co-operation. It is on that basis that the non-aligned countries will call, at the forty-fourth session, for the adoption of a final decision on convening the World Conference on Environment and Development in 1992.
The next priority is the full realization of human rights and freedoms. The non-aligned countries stress that the right of every individual to full enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights is the source of the greatest inspiration to the Movement, and one of its basic objectives. They confirmed that they share fully the wide and growing recognition of the special importance of the full enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, both collective and individual. Indeed, there can be no rights and freedoms of people without the individual rights and freedoms of every person. We in Yugoslavia believe that the extent to which an individual enjoys fundamental rights and freedoms is the measure of the degree of democratisation of the society and of the possibility of their inclusion in broader democratic processes in the world to which we aspire.
In this context, one should, however, bear in mind the fact that civil and political rights cannot be separated from the economic, social and other rights and needs of man, and that in a great majority of developing countries the economic and social conditions are quite difficult. Finally, the non-aligned countries are pledged to strive to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations in discharging its legitimate responsibility for resolving all major problems of the world. For this purpose, they will endeavour to ensure that the machinery of the Organization is reinforced, and its activities efficiently coordinated - convinced that, as they have stressed, the role of multilateralism is growing at both the global and the regional levels. I am confident that this view is shared by other members of the Organization.
Those are the priorities set by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at their ninth summit in Belgrade. My country fully supports and endorses them and, as co-ordinator of the activities of the non-aligned countries, will endeavour to see them realized in the near future. On the basis of their political decisions, and in keeping with these priorities and with their positions on specific issues, the non-aligned countries approach the work of this session determined to make a constructive contribution. 
This session of the General Assembly, like the last one, is being held in an international climate amenable to the consideration of crucial world issues. This facilitates our work, but also heightens our responsibility for future developments. It is our special responsibility, by ensuring the success of this session, to make a substantive contribution to the strengthening and further affirmation of the United Nations in resolving key global problems. May the forty-fourth session of the Genera] Assembly bring more genuine co-operation and less confrontation than any previous one. If we achieve that, the results will more than live up to our expectations. What is more, we might even manage to overcome some of the psychological limits that ingrained beliefs and long-established practice impose on us. Those are the factors that limit, perhaps even imperil our future.
","After a long period of tension over the past few years the situation has started to change; world tensions are easing, and this is having a positive effect on the process of resolving some protracted world crises and problems. This specific assessment has been thoroughly elaborated: the ever-more-difficult position of developing countries whereby a majority of mankind is denied access to scientific and technological achievements is the major obstacle to global aspirations to integration on the basis of interdependence and equitable co-operation. The messages of the Ninth Summit Conference and the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 which preceded it unequivocally express the readiness of non-aligned and other developing countries jointly to seek effective and generally acceptable solutions to the key and interrelated problems of external debt, development, financing, trade, raw materials and technology, as well as to the specific and particularly acute problems weighing upon the least developed countries. Stressing their commitment to the goal of complete eradication of colonialism, the non-aligned countries once again pledged to strengthen their solidarity with non-aligned and other countries facing aggression, intervention or interference in their internal affairs. Despite all the difficulties, we believe that continuation of the Secretary-General's good offices and the inter-communal talks, in an atmosphere marked by an overall improvement in international relations, will lead finally to decisive breakthroughs in resolving the Cyprus problem."
44,1989,BRB,"ï»¿
Mr. President, I am very pleased to see such a distinguished son of Africa receive the honour of presiding over the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The bonds between our two countries, Nigeria end Barbados, are of long standing, rooted in a common past, enriched by Ð° common drive to uplift our peoples and un weakened by the distance that separates us. We know intimately of your personal skill and flair in diplomacy. I unhesitatingly pledge the full co-operation of my delegation during your tenure.
May I also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his skilful chairmanship and guidance throughout the forty-third session.
Since the birth of the Organization some 45 years ago the world has made considerable progress. The age of high technology is with us. Many countries of the industrialized world have achieved high standards of living and substantial material advancement for their people. After more than three almost-uninterrupted decades of direct and indirect confrontation, the leading nuclear Powers have begun to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into priming-hooks. With that development has followed an apparent weariness with conflict-by-proxy across the far readies of the globe There seems to be a genuine universal desire to participate in the search for peace.
It is, however, incumbent upon the super-Powers to ensure that this new dimension in their relations is no passing phenomenon, no short respite while arsenals are refurbished and economies restructured. It is our hope that the developments of the past two years are the basis for lasting global peace. 
Star the peoples of the non-industrialized countries these trends present a unique opportunity for us to pursue our development free from the encumbrances of ideological conflict. We must remain vigilant however, and be determined that we never again become unwitting pawns in the deadly games of the not-too-distant past should there be a retreat into the old ways of super-Power rivalry. We must be ever vigilant, because many of the major problems that confront us today have no ideological solutions in the interdependent world in which we live.
And yet, in spite of the considerable progress the world has made, there remains a stubborn residue of problems that are as intractable today as they were half a century ago. For a large number of the world's population so little has changed in past decades that their development objectives, however modified, remain basically the same  For them, their economic and social problems are still their most urgent problems, and none of us can possibly say they are within sight of solution. There is still far too much degrading poverty on the face of the Earth. There are large inequalities in wealth within nations and between rich and poor nations. There are glaring gaps and disparities in the provision of housing, health and education for a substantial part of the world's population. There is the soul-destroying sickness of apartheid in South Africa and the lingering disease of racial intolerance and prejudice in many countries of the world. There are discord and conflict in the Middle East and smouldering embers of strife in South East Asia.
There ought to be no question that the struggle for economic advancement and social development of the non-industrialised nations of the world should be one of the urgent and consuming priorities of international life today.
The current international problems of debt, protectionism, the net reverse flew of financial resources, global warming, threats to the Earth's ozone layer, creeping deserts, pollution and other forms of environmental degradation, destruction wrought by hurricanes and other natural disasters, ANDS, drug abuse and the illegal traffic in drugs - all compound the plight of the peoples of the developing world.
I take this opportunity to express Barbados' sympathy with the countries that were recently ravaged by hurricane Hugo, particularly our sister countries in the Caribbean, and to urge the international community to co-ordinate and provide material support to the countries in need as a matter of urgency. I trust that these experiences will serve as an impetus to the international community to give its full support to the proclamation of the international decade for natural disasters.
Our responses to the challenges presented by the countless problems I have mentioned will be a test of the resilience of the multilateral system. Just as national development demands nothing less than the transformation of a society and its economy, so too in an interdependent world will economic and social development necessitate the transformation of attitudes in the international community and the transformation of the international economy. It is clear that the prescription calls for joint, co-operative and consensual action and responsibility if lasting solutions are to be found, solutions that do not themselves create more critical problems.
The foremost lesson to be learned in adherence to the principle of multilateralism is the danger of believing that any single country or group of countries can alone command the way forward or has exclusive insights into the way our relations on this planet should be shaped. Our history is replete with examples that reveal that that attitude oÂ£ mind has prevailed in the past, needless to say with disastrous consequences. In the final analysis everyone is searching for the way forward; from the smallest to the biggest, from the weakest to the strongest, everyone has a contribution to make in this process. 
For small developing countries like Barbados there is really no alternative to the multilateral process. We have no capacity to project military might beyond our shores. We command no great influence in the total scheme of international economic relations. But we have one means of making our voice heard at the global level that is through our contribution to the multilateral process and our appeal to fairness and equity in international relations.
We therefore urge the nations of the world to return to true multilateralism as the only effective way to meet the challenges of promoting and ensuring what has been described as self-sustaining, international economic growth and development t and a restructured economic system of co-operation. In relation to international debt, the record of action so far emphasizes the need for a global conference to look at the question of debt in all its dimensions. The ad hoc end piecemeal measures which have been put forward so far are clearly not addressing the problem in the timely and comprehensive manner that is necessary, failure to involve all parties, including particularly the private commercial banks, has produced obstacles to the full implementation of the various proposals, resulting in half-hearted efforts at implementation and less than full coverage of those affected.
In addition, the emergence of new centres of economic power and the prospect of new patterns of trade and investment make such a conference even more vital. Any further delay in holding the conference will only increase the already intolerable social costs being borne by indebted countries as they strive to repay their debts. It is certain that the terrible effects in terms of social upheaval and dislocation will be fait far beyond the confines of the national borders within which they occur.
In relation to the environment, it is heartening that there has been a fairly quick decision on a global approach to the problem. The General Assembly will have to work hard at this session to ensure that the preparations for the 1992 conference on environment and development are placed on a sure foundation. Even at this stage, however, some ideas can be offered about what Barbados would like to see emerge at, and from, the conference.
Barbados hopes that, as a minimum, some concrete measures will be agreed upon to enable developing countries to contribute more fully to the efforts to protect the global environment. We recognize that sacrifices will have to be made by all countries, but it is only equitable that the developed countries, which are in a better position to do so and which have contributed significantly to the present environmental problems, bear proportionately a larger portion of the burden.  Above all, arrangements to protect and preserve the environment must ensure that the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries to create a better life for their people secured.
I am happy to report that Barbados and its sister States members of the Caribbean Community have recently taken steps to create mechanisms at the regional level for ongoing consultation and co-operation on environmental matters which are of paramount interest to us all.
In relation to illegal narcotic drugs, it is clear that efforts to eliminate this menace will be doomed to failure unless they reflect the will of producer, consumer and transit States alike. So far, activity has been concentrated on efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs to consuming countries.
Efforts, however, to reduce and eliminate the demand for illegal drugs have be   not nearly as concerted and, as a result, not as effective. It has become evident that catchy slogans, although they serve to focus attention on the issue, are not sufficient. It will be necessary to direct much more effort and resources towards education to spread the message of the dangers of narcotic drugs for it is only when the demand of consumers is reduced that the core of the problem will have been reached. Equal emphasis will need to be placed on rehabilitation programmes to reclaim those who have become the victims of drug abuse. These measures are essential if the long-term dimensions of the drug problem are to be addressed.
Barbados' concern with the dangers of illegal drugs has been all the more heightened because our principal resource is our people. Barbados lacks large deposits of minerals, vast rivers and forests. It has been through the ingenuity of our people that some measure of progress may be seen in our development efforts. Our women in particular have played a significant and leading role in these development efforts. Thus, any factor which reduces the capacity of our people to fulfil the tasks of development is an attack on the very foundations of our existence as a nation. My country is in the process of adopting comprehensive measures aimed at effectively combating and halting the illegal traffic in drugs in Barbados. However, the efforts of individual countries need to be buttressed, and we commend regional and multilateral efforts.
In this regard, I wish to pledge the support of Barbados for the courageous and resolute efforts of President Virgilio Barco and the Government and people of Colombia to free their country from the grip of narco-terror. We support, too, the initiatives presented by the Governments of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica aimed at excising the cancer of illicit trade in drugs and we urge the international community to join in this support.
The scourge of ANDS, like drug abuse and drug trafficking, respects no borders. It is vital that in the fight against ANDS the international community deploy all the resources at its command. Above all, it is imperative that developments in science and technology be made available to all countries if the universal battle against ANDS is to be waged successfully. The choice is clean we unite- or perish.
Developing countries like Barbados are engaged in an interminable struggle to ensure that we are not left behind in the evolution of the global economy. There is an unfortunate trend for developed countries increasingly to coordinate their policies in key economic sectors without involving a range of the developing nations which will ultimately be affected by those policies. Barbados fully supports the efforts at consultation among those with the greatest capacity to effect change in the international economy. We feel, however, that such co-ordination should more fully take into account and reflect the views and concerns of those with the greatest needs.
Certain factors should govern the transformation of the global economy. Foremost among these is the unequal capacities of developing and developed countries to make the necessary adaptations. The developed countries are better able by far to adjust to the new realities; indeed they are helping to create the momentum for change. It is vital, therefore, that the developing countries be helped to make the necessary adjustments; for it is only if the transformation of the developing countries corresponds to that of the developed world that a true balance can be attained which favours the majority over minority interests.
This year we witness the celebration of the emergence and triumph of democracy in at least three countries. The Republic of Costa Rica will shortly mark the 100th anniversary of its democracy. The Republic of Prance has celebrated the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. We congratulate those countries. My own country, Barbados, is commemorating 350 years of Parliament. Our experience of 350 years of parliamentary government has taught us the power which resides in the hands of the people. Prom a narrowly constituted body reflecting the interests of a minority of colonists, the Barbados Parliament has been transformed into a truly representative institution in which the concerns of all Barbadians may be pursued. It is against this background that Barbadians can empathize with the aspirations of people throughout the world to become masters of their destiny, through freely and democratically elected representatives.
This aspiration has burned strong in the breasts of the oppressed people of southern Africa. Change is on the horizon for Namibia after years of domination by the apartheid regime of South Africa. Barbados's long-standing commitment to this process of change is underscored by the deployment of a contingent of 21 Barbadian police officers in Namibia within the framework of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNIAG)  But the international community must remain vigilant lest  at the eleventh hour, the evil regime of apartheid conspires to snatch the prize of freedom from the grasp of the Namibian people. Certain ominous developments in Namibia only serve to warn of that possibility. It is therefore vitally important that the apartheid regime be told in no uncertain terms, especially by those to whom it must listen, that the international community will not be satisfied with anything less than freedom for the Namibian people.
He must be conscious, however, that the achievement of political freedom is only the starting-point for Namibia's membership of the community of nations. Considerable financial and technical assistance will be necessary to place the country on the path to economic development. My country has in its small way tried to further this cause through regular contributions to the various funds for Namibia and the provision of educational scholarships for Namibians in Barbados. Barbados stands ready to continue and intensify the assistance which it has been giving to Namibians and urges all members of the international community to do likewise within their respective capabilities. He will have failed in our several responsibilities if we merely assist in Namibia's emergence as an independent nation under the shadow of apartheid's economic domination.
The international community equally cannot relax until the stain of' apartheid is eradicated from South Africa and truly representative government is introduced in benighted land. He must not be fooled by the merely cosmetic changes which have been made in South Africa through the staging of totally undemocratic elections. That is merely an attempt to give apartheid a respectable face and prolong its existence as well as an attempt to lull the international community into inaction on the eradication of apartheid. But none of us, none of the nations which proclaim support for fundamental and inalienable human rights, the essential principles of justice and equality and the virtues of a democratic form of government can be satisfied until that odious system f apartheid is completely eliminated. For while the situation in South Africa lingers it remains an obstacle to world peace.
The hunger for peace is evident in the decision reached by the five Presidents of Central America at their meeting in August in Tela# Honduras. Barbados has long supported the principle of applying regional solutions to regional problems. We have on several occasions and in various forums reaffirmed out support for, and commitment to  the peace initiatives launched by the Contadora Group. We pledge our support for the peace process, which has now been given a renewed impetus, and call upon all States to do likewise.
It is unfortunate that while it may be considered that some progress towards peace has been realized in one dimension of the Central American problem, elsewhere on the isthmus tension and strife are steadily increasing. A series of unfortunate events has dealt a serious blow to the hopes of the democratic forces in Panama. Following the abrupt suspension of the democratic process in the presidential elections held in Panama in May this year, the Prime Minister of Barbados, the Bight Honourable Erskine Sandiford, issued a statement voicing Barbados concern that any deterioration of the situation in Panama could lead to an escalation of tensions in the region with the gravest consequences for the peace and security of the hemisphere. He expressed the view that the democratic nations of the hemisphere could help to resolve the crisis in Panama by insisting that any solution must be consistent with respect for human rights and authentic democracy on the basis of fair and free elections, with the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to determine their own destiny free from external intervention, with the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties, and achieved through peaceful negotiations. Once again we urge all States to work within these parameters for the rapid and. peaceful resolution of the crisis in Panama.
The international community must also renew its efforts to bring peace to that long troubled region, the Middle East. Barbados believes that  Î¹ international conference on the Middle East offers the best hope for a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Middle East question. Peace will continue to be an elusive objective until the desire of the Palestinian people for a homeland and the right of all States in the region to live within secure boundaries. He urge those in authority to fulfil the responsibilities which are theirs by virtue of their power and to move swiftly to the table of internationally sponsored negotiations and so end the deadly cycle of violent.
Barbados agrees with the view that the United Nations system represents manâs loftiest hopes for a better future. As a mechanism for solving problems the United Nations system is without parallel. It provides opportunities for a cross-fertilisation of ideas, and its Charter, notwithstanding the criticisms levelled against it, offers the most comprehensive guidelines for international action yet crafted by man.
For all its potential the united Nations system can do no more than the will of the Member States allows. It is therefore imperative that we fulfil our obligations to the Organisation, No longer can its operations be held to ransom through non-compliance with legal obligations regarding payment of contributions. Solemn undertakings must not be cast aside in the pursuit of national objectives. the United Nations is not to be supported when it suits narrow national interests and simply shunted aside when it does not.
It is clear, however, that the reform of the United Nations system must be carried forward speedily if its operations ace to be placed on a sound and secure footing for the future. In relation to United Nations peace-keeping activities it is clear that in the last two years demands on the Organization have increased considerably. As negotiated settlements are reached in one conflict area after the other, it is likely that the United Nations will be called upon to act as guarantor of the peace again and again. If the United Nations is to fulfil in the most efficient manner the demands being made upon it then some attention must be paid to enhancing its capacity in the area of peace supervision. Only in this way can we hope to avoid some of the difficulties which have been evident. In addition we must counter the forces which would see the United Nations as e mere shield, a cover for the pursuit of national interests as opposed to the interests of the world community as a whole.
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have given their lives in the service of the United Nations. Humankind cannot afford to ignore the possibilities which have been afforded us for a brighter tomorrow. To do so would be to condemn ourselves to repeat the mistakes of past decades with perhaps even more severe consequences for life on this planet. Barbados is convinced that if these opportunities for peace and development are to be exploited to the fullest they must be brought fully within the ambit of the United Nations system} they must not be left to the vagaries of changing personalities and alliances, or continue to exist at the level of bilateral or only partially multilateral relations. 
Our future action must also more fully reflect a commitment to certain principles and objectives. Those that come quickly to mind include: a renewed commitment to the process of consultation, the broadening of co-ordination in the economic sector, the equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities; the search for comprehensive, as opposed to partial, ad hoc and temporary solutions to problems; the intensification of support, for the economic recovery of developing countries; greater attention to the human dimension of development; respect for basic human rights over narrow national concerns; and the fulfilment of the aspiration of all peoples to self-determination.
Those are not new ideas. I certainly claim no right of authorship over them. They have been around for a long time, unfortunately more often ignored than recognized. I believe the success of our efforts to bequeath a better world to succeeding generations will largely depend on our commitment to those principles.
As we look back on the developments that have taken place in the recent past, we have cause for hope. There is an atmosphere of optimism, albeit cautious at times, that great things are within the grasp of mankind if only we put our minds and energies to the task of achieving them. As we face the future we can draw sustenance from the belief that a new era of peace and development can be ushered in on this planet.
The peoples of the developing world aspire to far more them mere survival. They deserve a. nobler destiny, a concept justified by the high moral obligation to recognize the inherent equality of all human beings and to acknowledge that there is dignity in the human reason and that every living soul on the face of the Earth deserves an equal opportunity to strive, and to achieve, and to create a more just and humane world. 
","The foremost lesson to be learned in adherence to the principle of multilateralism is the danger of believing that any single country or group of countries can alone command the way forward or has exclusive insights into the way our relations on this planet should be shaped. The ad hoc end piecemeal measures which have been put forward so far are clearly not addressing the problem in the timely and comprehensive manner that is necessary, failure to involve all parties, including particularly the private commercial banks, has produced obstacles to the full implementation of the various proposals, resulting in half-hearted efforts at implementation and less than full coverage of those affected.

44,1989,IRQ,"ï»¿
Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session, and to wish you success in presiding over this session. The ties that exist between Iraq and Nigeria are those of friendship and mutual esteem, aid this is an added incentive for us to co-operate with you for the success of the session and the achievement of the noble aims and purposes of the United Nations.
I would also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts put forth by your predecessor, Mr. Caputo, for the success of the General Assembly's work last year.
Iraq firmly believes in the role of the United Nations as an indispensable international organization for the maintenance of international peace and security and the consolidation of friendly relations among nations on the basis of equality, mutual respect, the realization of international co-operation in all fields, and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination.
A few weeks ago, the Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries renewed the commitment of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to its role and responsibility in regard to the maintenance of peace and the consolidation of co-operation with a view to the development and prosperity in all countries. The Conference also emphasized the role of the tinted Nations in the establishment of peace and the settlement of international conflicts through dialogue and in conformity with the principles of justice.
The United Nations has been deeply concerned at the war that Iran launched against Iraq and persisted in waging for eight whole years. The General Assembly and the Security Council have adopted many resolutions calling for an end to the hostilities and for the settlement of the conflict on the basis of the United Nations Charter and international law - resolutions that were accepted by Iraq but rejected by Iran. The most recent of these was resolution 598 (1987), which was accepted by Iraq immediately after its adoption, but which Iran refused to comply with for a whole year, until it declared its acceptance of it in circumstances well known to the international community. It was under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the agreement of 8 August 1988 was reached, providing the basis for the cease-fire that came into effect on 20 August 1988. That agreement also established the mechanism for reaching a common understanding of the provisions of resolution 598 (1987) and of the procedures and timing for their implementation through direct talks to be conducted between the two parties under the auspices of the Secretary-General.
It is regrettable, however, that last year, during which several meetings were held between the two sides under the auspices of the Secretary-General, did not witness the holding of genuine direct talks that would achieve the objective envisaged in resolution 598 (1987) and the agreement of 8 August 1988 namely, the establishment of a comprehensive and lasting peace between Iraq and Iran and in the Arab Gulf region. The Iranian side resorted to turning the said meetings into an arena for polemics and propaganda and insisted upon its well-known selective approach, stressing the aspects in which it saw its own interests, while showing no real willingness to enter into a serious discussion of the other issues that would strike a balance and ensure the common interests of the two parties. We have every right to be suspicious of this approach, which is aimed at achieving Iranian gains, in the absence of a comprehensive lasting peace, while perpetuating a no-peace-no-war situation to which no end appears to be in sight.
Iraq cautions the international community against this dangerous approach, on which Iran has so far insisted. Iraq cannot accept any partial measures or plans that serve the Iranian scheme of perpetuating the state of no war and no peace. This stance is shared by all the countries of the region in view of the negative consequences of this situation for security and stability in the region. Throughout this past year we have taken care to give Iran ample opportunities, encouraging it to take the road to peace. We took the initiative in calling for the release of the sick and wounded prisoners of war and announcing our readiness to conduct an immediate and comprehensive exchange of such prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. We demobilized more than 200,000 men from the Iraqi armed forces between 18 October 1988 and 30 June 1989* we stopped enlistment in the People's Army as of 19 June 1989, disbanded a whole army corps of our land forces and, only a few days ago, decided to disband five divisions of our land forces. 
As regards reconstruction and development, we have rebuilt and rehabilitated the two valiant cities of Basrah aid Fao, despite the fact that they remain within the range of Iranian guns and artillery.
	Iraq was, and remains, desirous of establishing in good faith a comprehensive and lasting peace with Iran on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). It reaffirms the respect which it has demonstrated without question throughout the years of the conflict, for the principles and norms upon which our international Organization was founded: peace, respect for the sovereignty and independence of peoples, rejection of the policies of hegemony aid interference in the internal affairs of others, and respect for the territorial integrity of States, together with their legitimate rights corroborated by the rules aid precedents of international law. 
	The step required now, after more than a year of inaction for which Iran bears full responsibility, is to go back to the table of direct negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General aid in accordance with the agreement of 8 August 1988 and to work seriously and sincerely on the implementation of resolution 598 (1987) as a comprehensive peace plan ensuring security, stability and good neighbourliness between the two countries and in the region on a permanent basis, under the auspices of the United Nations and with United Nations guarantees.. Iran's selective attitudes, along with its resort to manoeuvring and extortionist tactics, have prolonged the suffering of more than 100,000 Iraqi and Iranian prisoners of war and have increased the pain of their families, who had found hope in the cease-fire.
Paragraph 3 of resolution 598 (1987), which cites article 118 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, obligates the two sides, in an unequivocal manner, to release the prisoners of war without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. Iran refuses to begin implementing this obligation, however, claiming that active hostilities have not ceased as yet. This constitutes a dangerous precedent. No similar case has ever occurred throughout the history of the United Nations or during the period preceding its founding. The Iranian stand, with the refusal to release the prisoners of war after the cease-fire, is contrary to the legal and realistic definition of the cessation of active hostilities confirmed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its note of 31 March 1989, addressed to both Iraq and Iran, and in particular, to paragraph 2 of that note.
This Iranian stand vis-Ã -vis the issue of prisoners of war is concrete evidence of bad intent, of disrespect for the rules of international law, and of disregard for the values prevailing in the international community. The United Nations must shoulder its legal and humanitarian responsibilities and address this tragedy by bringing Iran to respect humanitarian international law and renounce the policy of holding people hostage for political ends, a policy that Iran is well-known to have been practising systematically.
We welcome the attention recently given by the Security Council to this issue and hope that the Council's concern will bring lean to comply with the provisions of international law and respond to our appeal and that of the ICRC for an immediate release of all prisoners of war, so as to put an end to their bitter suffering.
The Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine continues to date, in contravention of the will of the international community. The Israeli forces of occupation continue to launch one military campaign after another, using violence and terrorism against the valiant popular Palestinian intifadah, which is about to enter its third year.
The resolutions adopted by the General Assembly during its Geneva meeting in January 1988 on the Palestine question reaffirm the fact that the majority of the countries of the world stand by the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
The Palestine Liberation Organization has taken a number of courageous initiatives to reaffirm its commitment to international legality and to the resolutions of the Security Council.
The continuation of the Israeli occupation, the refusal to accept the glaring aid certain fact that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole aid legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the denial of the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and to establish its own independent State with Al-Quds as its capital, constitute a threat to security and peace in the region and in the world at large.
Those who persist in occupation and deny the Palestine Liberation Organization its role in representing its people are simply expressing an attitude that is aggressive, reactionary, and contrary to the course of history and to the values upon which this Organization as well as our contemporary international life are based. These are the people who are primarily responsible for the pain suffered by the people of our region and for the state of instability, tension and terror that persists there. The whole world is aware of the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and of its policies of invasion and occupation of the land of Palestine, and other contiguous countries, including Lebanon, as was demonstrated by its impertinent aggression against Iraq in June 1981. The Zionist regime has tried and continues to try to be the biggest military Power in the region. It possesses and stores nuclear and chemical weapons in order to perpetuate its occupation of the land of Palestine and imposes its domination over all the countries of the region.
The whole world is also well aware of the grave violations, by the Zionist regime, of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, violations that are now documented in sound and picture in the daily news reports as well as in the official reports of the United Nations and many other international and regional organizations. Responsibility dictates that the Members of the United Nations, in particular the members of the Security Council, implement the provisions of the Charter applicable to such situations to deter the forces of occupation from perpetrating these crimes and that they bring to an end the Israeli occupation and aggress ion.
The United States of America is responsible in great measure for the continuation of the policy of occupation, arrogance and terrorism pursued by the Zionist regime, for it is the United States that continues to provide this regime with arms and political cover.
The United States is called upon to change this policy, which it has followed for several decades now, and deal with the free will of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization, its sole and legitimate representatives to recognize without reservation or prevarication the rights of the Arab Palestinian people to the establishment of their independent State, and to shoulder its responsibilities by exercising pressure on the occupiers in order to bring them to comply with the international will to end the occupation and to ensure the just and legitimate rights of the Arab Palestinian people.
The tragedy suffered by the Lebanese people is now entering its fourteenth year amidst further destruction, killing and devastation resulting from the continuation of occupation and external interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon.
Iraq condemns the Israeli military occupation of south Lebanon. It condemns also the Syrian and Iranian occupation of Lebanon. Iraq sees that no solution can be found to the Lebanese crisis but by terminating this occupation, putting an end to external interference in Lebanese internal affairs, and creating a suitable climate of freedom for the Lebanese people to settle their internal problems and achieve national reconciliation through dialogue. We support the efforts made by the league of Arab States, represented by the Arab Tripartite Committee, to resolve the Lebanese crisis in accordance with the resolutions of the Casablanca summit, ensure the withdrawal of non-Lebanese forces and help the Lebanese reach national reconciliation, formulate a new system based on justice and fairness and enable the Lebanese State to exercise its full sovereignty over the whole Lebanon.
Iraq has always stood by the right of peoples to self-determination end extended material and moral support for the achievement of this objective. Today we are about to witness the declaration of Namibia's independence in accordance with the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia which was initiated on 1 April 1989 on the basis of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 640 (1989).
We call upon the Secretary-General to take the measures stated in the Declaration on Namibia, issued by the ninth summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, with a view to ensuring the rights of the Namibian people to self-determination and national independence.
Our world is undergoing broad economic changes affecting the course of international economic relations. Scientific and technological developments have deepened the cultural and economic gap between the developing and the developed countries. We note with concern the increase in the disparities between the countries of the developing world and those of the developed world. The sharp decline in the prices of basic commodities and raw materials aid the fall in crude oil prices have, for years now, been causing huge losses in the revenues of the developing countries and thus causing a grave deterioration in their economic situation, a stagnation in their development programmes and a fall in the standard of living of their peoples.
We agree that there is a need to extend assistance to the developing countries in their efforts to resume the process of restructuring their economies aid diversifying their exports in order to ensure sufficient funds with which to continue their development operations.
Economic co-operation among the developing countries deserves the highest consideration and offers the only possibility before us. The establishment of the Arab Co-operation Council is a practical step towards the positive use of regional groupings for achievement of the objective of collective self-reliance among the countries of those groupings. We regard economic co-operation between those developing countries and the developed ones as an essential element in an interrelated and integrated world in which we would all strive for the good of mankind as a whole,
We look forward to engaging in a serious dialogue at the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1990, which will be devoted to international economic co-operation and to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries.
The external debt problem of the developing countries and the servicing of debts are among the gravest problems facing all countries in the world, creditor and debtor alike. The sums involved amount to one half of the gross national products of the developing countries, thus representing a real obstacle to the continued implementation of their programmes of economic and social development. A reasonable aid equitable solution must, therefore, be found to this problem if we are to ensure better relations among States and a better life for their peoples.
The resolution adopted at the Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries calling for the convening of a conference under the auspices of the United Nations to consider all aspects of the external debt problem, in a manner consistent with the requirements of development, will perhaps provide a suitable opportunity to reach acceptable solutions to this problem, which causes constant erosion of all economic gains and human efforts.
The other source of concern for mankind is the continued deterioration of the Environment and the climate on this planet, while we consider protection of the environment to be a integral part of the requirements for development, we emphasize that this problem must be addressed in a comprehensive multilateral manner that will take account of all the aspects aid adopt measures necessary for warding off the risks of an environmental disaster that our world might be exposed to. Consideration should be given to the development priorities of the developing countries and to respect for the principle of their sovereign control over their natural resources.
In conclusion, I wish to restate our willingness to co-operate with the President for the success of our work during this session.
","Iraq firmly believes in the role of the United Nations as an indispensable international organization for the maintenance of international peace and security and the consolidation of friendly relations among nations on the basis of equality, mutual respect, the realization of international co-operation in all fields, and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination. The Iranian side resorted to turning the said meetings into an arena for polemics and propaganda and insisted upon its well-known selective approach, stressing the aspects in which it saw its own interests, while showing no real willingness to enter into a serious discussion of the other issues that would strike a balance and ensure the common interests of the two parties. It reaffirms the respect which it has demonstrated without question throughout the years of the conflict, for the principles and norms upon which our international Organization was founded: peace, respect for the sovereignty and independence of peoples, rejection of the policies of hegemony aid interference in the internal affairs of others, and respect for the territorial integrity of States, together with their legitimate rights corroborated by the rules aid precedents of international law. Iraq sees that no solution can be found to the Lebanese crisis but by terminating this occupation, putting an end to external interference in Lebanese internal affairs, and creating a suitable climate of freedom for the Lebanese people to settle their internal problems and achieve national reconciliation through dialogue. We regard economic co-operation between those developing countries and the developed ones as an essential element in an interrelated and integrated world in which we would all strive for the good of mankind as a whole,
We look forward to engaging in a serious dialogue at the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1990, which will be devoted to international economic co-operation and to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries."
44,1989,HUN,"ï»¿
I should like to extend to you my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.
At this session the General Assembly is beginning its deliberations in favourable international circumstances. The processes that exerted a positive influence on the atmosphere of the forty-third session have become increasingly decisive in world politics. The development of a qualitatively new relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States is of outstanding importance in this regard. In addition, relations between East and West are developing and dialogues between countries are becoming more substantive. The world is witnessing the beginning of a new era in which the 'enemy' image based on 'cold war' stereotypes is fading away, with confrontation giving way to an interest in guaranteeing the security of the other side, and with isolationism being replaced by a desire for co-operation based on partnership. There is a growing realization that the use or threat of the use of force cannot be a tool of foreign policy and that problems must be solved through negotiation, by political means.
The positive changes taking place in world politics are making it possible, and the new social, economic and ecological challenges are making it necessary, for the United Nations to assume a more active role in, and to take more initiatives for, the maintenance of international peace and security and the prevention and solution of regional and global problems and conflicts. There is increasing evidence that the world Organization is becoming an international centre for accommodating divergent interests and organizing joint action. In this respect, we
believe that in order to ensure that the United Nations shall be truly universal we should make it possible for all States that so wish to join our world Organization. I should like to take this opportunity to express my Government's appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his untiring efforts, through which he has done much to enhance the prestige of the United Nations.
The positive changes in East-West relations have had a particularly favourable effect on the situation in Europe, which is of paramount importance for the foreign policy of Hungary. On the threshold of the third millennium, relations of a new type and duality are taking shape on the continent of Europe. As the bloc mentality recedes into the background, there is a growing awareness of an all-European identity and there is a common interest in breaking down the divisions that have persisted now for decades. The final document adopted in Vienna at the latest Follow-up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is the most important CSCE document since the Helsinki Final Act was signed. It has raised the system of European relations to a qualitatively higher level and has set in motion a dynamic, long-term programme of action within national and pan-European frameworks alike.
As a result of the agreements reached at the Vienna meeting, talks have begun on reducing conventional forces in Europe. Also as a result of these agreements, meetings are to be held every year on the human dimension, and these will serve to ensure the continuity of the all-European dialogue on human rights.
We are convinced that the advance of the favourable processes that are unfolding calls for a new type of thinking based on the paramount importance of the interests of humanity as a whole. The realities of our time demand inter-State relations and co-operation, free of ideological prejudice and based on mutual advantage and interests. Mindful of these criteria, Hungary is prepared to co-operate with all countries of the world on the basis of partnership.
In this more favourable international situation, when political means and solutions are assuming an increasing role in guaranteeing security, disarmament talks and their results are being viewed in a new light. The past year has witnessed well-known and important events relating to disarmament. However, there has been no breakthrough so far, and we must therefore make further serious efforts on the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels.
On the eve of the last decade of the millennium, we have not managed to reduce the nuclear threat significantly. At the same time, the experience gained in implementing the historic Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate and Shorter-Range Nuclear Missiles clearly indicates that real security can indeed be sought through nuclear disarmament.
The Hungarian Government has on many occasions expressed its conviction that a number of substantive disarmament issues - such as foe example a comprehensive nuclear test ban, nuclear disarmament, the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons, and the prevention of an arms race in space - cannot only be resolved on a global basis and with the whole-hearted participation of the international community. For this reason, we regret that the results achieved through the multilateral forums on these issues have been so meagre.
In respect of the preparations for the Fourth Review Conference on the Implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), we hope that there will be an opportunity to strengthen the Treaty on the international scale and to increase the number of States parties. We favour strengthening the non-proliferation regime and keeping the NPT in force beyond 1995.
The political success of the Paris Conference on chemical weapons has not yet made itself felt in the negotiations that are going on within the framework of the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament, and there is still no agreement on a number of the essential elements of the future treaty.
In recent years, the Hungarian Government has made several initiatives or taken unilateral steps to try to help speed up the pace of negotiations on the banning of chemical weapons and to promote the early preparation of a draft convention. On behalf of the Hungarian People's Republic, I declare from this rostrum that Hungary is ready to comply with all the provisions of the convention now being drafted and to act in full conformity with it even before it is concluded and enters into force.
That means, inter alia, reaffirming that on Hungarian territory there are neither chemical weapons nor industrial plants capable of producing such weapons and that the production of the Hungarian chemical industry and the trade in chemicals serve exclusively peaceful purposes. In accordance with the envisaged articles of the convention we shall make an itemized declaration, to be renewed on a regular basis, on the production of and foreign trade in chemicals. Even before the conclusion and entry into force of the convention, we are ready to accept verification, including on-site inspection, on a reciprocal basis, regarding all the declared facts and figures, as well as our military, industrial and trading activities relating to the scope of the convention. We consider that the potentialities of the United Nations can be used for this purpose under a procedure to be adopted later.
In agreement with the Government of the Soviet Union, I can also inform the General Assembly that the possibility of verification extends also to the installations of the Soviet army in Hungary.
The unilateral disarmament measures of the Soviet Union and several other Warsaw Treaty member States, including Hungary, created a favourable political atmosphere for the Vienna talks on conventional weapons, which started last spring. We hope that it will be possible to reach agreement at the negotiations as early as 1990.
Hungary is seeking to contribute to the attainment of this objective by its own means, including unilateral measures, such as reductions in its military budget, troop strength and military equipment. In the course of talks we have released, in the spirit of greater military openness and on a unilateral basis, data on the structure and deployment of our armed forces in order to help resolve problems concerning the exchange of military data.
Also falling within this framework is the regional security policy initiative for the establishment of a 100-kilometre-wide contiguous zone of security, confidence-building and co-operation, partially free of offensive weapons, along the common borders of Hungary, Austria and Yugoslavia, for the purpose of developing economic and trade relations, preserving the natural environment and deepening comprehensive co-operation in the human dimension.
The open-skies initiative likewise deserves attention as it is aimed at lessening tensions, building confidence and promoting verification of disarmament measures, including future agreements on conventional forces in Europe. We believe it would be useful to start consultations with the participation of interested countries to explore the details of the proposal. Such talks at the level of experts could make it possible to find elements of common interest. The Hungarian side is ready for that and expresses its willingness to participate in the preparation of such a co-operative venture.
The elimination and political settlement of regional hotbeds of crisis are significant factors for establishing international peace and security. As a result of efforts undertaken by various countries and the world Organization, solutions to several questions on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly have been brought within reach. The United Nations has considerably increased its involvement in drawing up frameworks and ensuring technical conditions for the settlement of regional conflicts. The success of the peace-keeping operations of the world Organization is clear evidence that the United Nations is able to measure up to these requirements.
The Hungarian Government welcomes the fact that the deadlock on the independence of Namibia has been broken. The multilateral talks among the States concerned have yielded results and the preparatory stage for the holding of the first free election has begun. Hungary's participation in the fulfilment of the
monitoring tasks of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) is a modest contribution towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict by political means.
The conditions for a settlement of the Middle East crisis are now more favourable as a result of international efforts made in furtherance of a solution and, not least, because of the flexible shifts in the position as well as the initiatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PI/3) and the Arab States. Hungary favours the early convening of the International Peace Conference with the participation of all parties concerned, including the PIO and the State of Israel, for the purpose of reaching a lasting and just settlement. It is our conviction that an open and unbiased approach increases the possibilities for the settlement of the crisis. Our relations with all interested parties are aimed at serving that very purpose.
The operation of the international financial system continues to be burdened with structural malfunctions and with strains resulting from the internal economic imbalances of various countries. The debt crisis has grown more pressing over the years, and international trade is still coping with serious disorders. Consequently, world market mechanisms operate in a distorted form.
Unfortunately, the negative trends of the world economy have prompted some countries and groups of countries to safeguard national interests by protectionist and discriminatory measures rather than by seeking solutions to existing problems on the basis of mutual interests. Such artificial obstacles to international economic co-operation impose added burdens on the countries heavily dependent on co-operation and have a particularly adverse effect on those which, by mobilizing their shrinking internal resources, try to adjust to changing conditions and to catch up with countries that have succeeded in their adjustment efforts.
Adjustment to the increasingly complex world economic conditions is a serious trial for Hungary as well. Our rapidly advancing reforms are aimed at creating an open market economy based on the equality of types of property and at seeking integration into the world economy. For us to succeed in these efforts it is necessary to have a world economic environment based on mutually advantageous relations and on the principle of fulfilment in good faith of contractual obligations. We are firmly committed to being guided in our economic relations not by ideological and political considerations but by ensuring the priority of economic interests.
At present we see possibilities for accommodating national, regional and global interests and objectives in different fields of economic life. We think that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are able to facilitate co-ordination of related endeavours, primarily by exploring possibilities for mutually advantageous co-operation and resolving contradictions and conflicts of interest. The new development strategy for the 1990s, if it proceeds from the real economic situation and sets realistic objectives, will be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the world economy.
My Government welcomes the fact that the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms has become a dynamic element of international security. It is our conviction that human rights are universal values. Consequently, respect for, and protection of, human rights cannot be considered an exclusively internal matter of any State, and enjoyment of them must be independent of the social system of a particular country or the type of alliance to which it belongs. The United Nations Charter, international covenants and other conventions embody the voluntarily assumed obligations of States with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms. For us, therefore, there can be no Western or Eastern, Northern or Southern human rights.
Today, at the end of the century, we deem it a natural requirement that human rights and fundamental freedoms be accorded equal measures of universal international protection. The obligations of States today imply, on the one hand, that Governments have a responsibility to their own citizens for the observance of these rights and, on the other, that the community of nations can require any country to fulfil such obligations in good faith.
The Hungarian Government is making consistent efforts to bring our national legislation and practice into line with our international obligations. Our insistence on establishing the broadest possible international co-operation for the full implementation of human rights has, likewise, become a marked feature of our policy.
To demonstrate its willingness that there should be international co-operation, and to ensure full compliance with its commitments, Hungary took another important step recently, on 13 September 1989 it officially informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that it considered itself bound by the individual-complaint mechanism in two additional areas â in respect of the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. By doing so, Hungary has joined those countries that fully accept the competence of all United Nations bodies concerned with human rights in cases of communications from States parties or from individuals.
We have revised our position regarding the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as well. In the past we did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Court, but currently we are considering the practicability of withdrawing our reservations relating to it. In our latest international treaties no reservations were made regarding the clauses on the jurisdiction of the Court.
A timely task for us is to revise our internal laws and practices in order to resolve the grave problems relating to refugees. As part of this endeavour, Hungary acceded, this year, to tile United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and to its Protocol. It is by applying the provisions of that Convention that we wish to settle the situation of persons seeking refuge in our country. We call for international co-operation aimed not only at alleviating the plight of people leaving their native lands but also at promoting efforts to eliminate the causes of the recent exodus of refugees.
There are still a number of deplorable instances of the violation of the rights of national, racial and religious majorities or minorities. We feel that the time has come for the United Nations to live up to its responsibility and to face the task of creating a new, up-to-date set of international rules which would guarantee the protection of minorities and which could replace the system of conventions on the protection of minorities that used to exist but was terminated owing to political circumstances.
The Hungarian Government is firmly committed to assuming an active role in this work of codification on the basis of the responsibility it feels for the fate of Hungarians dispersed throughout the world or living in the immediate neighbourhood of our country. Our action in this respect is guided by the principle that it is a fundamental human right of everyone and of every community to consider themselves as belonging to such nationality or religion as they wish and to arrange their lives in accordance with their national and religious feelings. This is the path we think should be followed in respect of all
individuals and peoples living in the Carpathian basin, in Europe - indeed, in any Part of the world. Hungary is undergoing a period of profound change, transforming its society. Politics and economy. Our people, as well as tearing down outdated structures, is engaged in creating institutional frameworks and guarantees for parliamentary democracy based on constitutional order. In this endeavour we proceed from the Primacy of international law. from the fact that the obligations assumed by our country as a sovereign and independent member of the international community take Precedence over national laws or bilateral and multilateral treaties or agreements that are not in line with our international legal and political obligations.
Concurrently with political changes, equally significant changes are being made in the economy, with the aim of creating an environment in which there will be wide scope for individual and collective, national and foreign initiatives. In recent years our country has done more than was done throughout previous decades to create a State governed by the rule of law. As a result of the steps and measures
that have been taken, and those that are envisaged, the reform process in Hungary has made considerable progress. Consistent implementation of our reforms is of vital national interest. My Government does not believe that a single party or organization would be able, alone, to carry out the reforms or to chart the paths and directions thereof. It wishes to undertake this task in common with all social forces willing to serve the interests of the Hungarian nation. Domestic and international conditions are favourable for this course of action. We are convinced that the success of these reforms transcends the boundaries of the region and is an important element for European stability and that therefore it cannot be a matter of indifference to other countries.
Prom the point of view of international relations, too, we consider it important that it be clearly recognized and reaffirmed, right now, that there is no exclusive model for any socio-political system and that such systems be judged not by their names but by their performance. Obviously, belonging to the same system of alliance cannot be grounds for military or any other kind of interference by States in the internal affairs of each other. It is for every State to determine independently and in a sovereign way its own destiny and its course of development, and for decisions of that kind every State should bear responsibility to its own people exclusively. This is the only way in which upheavals similar to the Hungarian tragedy of 1956 and other dramatic events can be avoided in the future.
This year, 1989, is the seventy-fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War and the fiftieth of the outbreak of the Second; both wars are referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations. The two wars which ignited the entire world started in Europe. Therefore, it is a strategic goal of my Governments foreign policy to work to reduce tension in Europe, end East-West confrontation and the division of the European continent, and create a united Europe on the basis of the Helsinki principles. We are striving to ensure that walls - both symbolic and real - separating peoples be removed as soon as possible and that a common European home be built in which the free movement of individuals, ideas and goods, as well as the preservation of the values of our civilization, will be taken for granted and ensured by guarantees.
In conclusion, I wish the General Assembly of our world Organization a successful forty-fourth session. 
","The Hungarian Government has on many occasions expressed its conviction that a number of substantive disarmament issues - such as foe example a comprehensive nuclear test ban, nuclear disarmament, the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons, and the prevention of an arms race in space - cannot only be resolved on a global basis and with the whole-hearted participation of the international community.

44,1989,AUT,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure, Sir, that I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this General Assembly. This is an expression of esteem for you as well as for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a country which has assumed a significant role in regional and international affairs. May I wish you every success in carrying out your important task.
I also wish to convey our sincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina, for the skilful leadership of our deliberations during the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Permit me to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his sacrificing and tireless service to the community of nations. The progress achieved towards peaceful solutions to many of the regional issues testifies to the manifold efforts and accomplishments of the Secretary-General and his dedicated staff.
This is once more an age of profound changes. Never before in history has our civilization faced such challenges. During the past 100 years the society of nations has moved from international relations to international cooperation, to ever more international administration and management. A system originally based on the use of force has become increasingly characterized by the use of diplomacy, with an ever-more-important role for international law.
In fact, the changes in the role of law in international relations have been impressive. Originally limited to regulating how and when to use force for Pursuing a country's legitimate claims, it has increasingly introduced other and more peaceful means of settling international conflicts. Three and a half centuries after Hugo Grotius, the famous Dutch philosopher, founded the modern concept of international law, the United Nations Charter now outlaws the use of military force in international relations.
However, the use of force has not remained the exclusive domain of States. Today, the international community must therefore strengthen its efforts to combat new forms of violence such as terrorism. The adoption of conventions against terrorism by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO, and the international Maritime Organization (IMO) as well as the various general assembly and Security Council resolutions, are steps in the right direction.
International law has reacted to the steadily advancing weapons technology, for instance by outlawing certain categories of weapons or by reducing the availability of particularly harmful arms. We fully support initiatives related to the limitation or prohibition of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons. The fundamentally positive changes in East-West relations, as reflected in the recent talks between President Bush, Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, give rise to expectations that disarmament diplomacy has entered a new phase, a phase in which further concrete results are within reach.
Accepting the supremacy of law in international relations must lead also to the strengthening of international judiciary bodies. The attention of the members of the international community must therefore be focused on the possibilities for dispute settlement offered by the International Court of Justice and the need for States to accept its compulsory jurisdiction. International peace and security, the most noble aim of the Charter, cannot be achieved if internal peace in Member States is in jeopardy. Wherever basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are denied to the individual human being, peace is in danger.
All endeavours to strengthen the role of international law with regard to human rights rely on the recognition of the principle that human rights are obligations under international law, a principle that can now be considered as universally recognized. Today, therefore, no State can any longer claim that international concern regarding its human rights situation is an interference in internal affairs.
On the basis of that principle an important step has been taken within the European framework by including further humanitarian commitments in the Vienna Concluding Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The adoption of the so-called mechanism of the human dimension of the C5CS might be regarded as the starting point for an all-European system for the promotion of human rights. However, the deteriorating situation of ethnic and religious minorities in certain European States since the adoption of the Vienna Concluding document clearly shows the wide gap between commitments and realities in this field, as history has amply demonstrated, citizens will identify with their Governments only to the extent that basic rights and freedoms are guaranteed.
May I suggest that the competent United Nations bodies study the relevant CSCE procedures with a view to their possible application on a universal level. I also wish to appeal to the Government of Romania fully to apply the mechanism in the field of human rights provided by the Vienna Concluding Document. The Paris meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE in May of this year
offered a welcome opportunity to review progress regarding the implementation by the participating States of their human rights commitments. On that occasion I made reference, inter alia, to the question of the Islamic community in Bulgaria. Let me express the hope that a negotiated solution of that problem can be found in the near future.
We wholeheartedly welcome the emphasis placed on human rights and fundamental freedoms by the members of the Non-Aligned Movement at their recent summit conference in Belgrade.
A new and significant field of international law relates to regional and global environmental resource systems, such as international river basins, the oceans, outer space, the polar regions and the atmosphere. Regulating the use and preservation of the global commons has widened the scope of international law in an unprecedented way. Our generation becomes accountable to future generations for this common heritage.
The report of the World Commission on Environment and Development provides us with an excellent conceptual framework in this regard both for national policies and for future work on the international level. We are convinced that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in 1992 must be based on the concept of sustainable development that has been elaborated in the report. Austria is faced with the problems of a precarious Alpine environment. Austrians have therefore developed a relatively high degree of environmental awareness reflected in the high standard of Austria's environmental legislation.
Hence it is only natural that Austria actively participates in international co-operation on environment, hosting international conferences on such important issues as climatic changes, the use of tropical forests and the protection of the ozone layer. The latter Conference has led to the respective Vienna Convention. We are prepared to play a similarly active role in the elaboration of an international convention on climatic change.
We also fully share the concerns of many with regard to the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal. The Basel Convention adopted earlier this year will be an important instrument for protecting human health and environment.
There can be little doubt that the current International institutional framework for environment decision-making and enforcement mechanisms requires strengthening. Austria therefore strongly supports all efforts aimed at reinforcing such existing UN structures as the UN environment programme. We believe that the Hague declaration will give strong impetus to internal endeavours in this direction. New legal instruments with regional and global scope may be required. We should review the possibility of drawing up an international environment charter that would set clear guidelines for action. 
 As the economic use of transnational environmental system becomes more competitive, appropriate procedures for dispute settlement will become indispensable. Just as we have become accustomed to Blue Helmets, which have become so useful in peace-keeping, we may express the firm hope that, in the foreseeable future, United Nations 'Green Helmets' may engage in the protection of the environment.
Solving regional conflict, is a priority task for the community of nations. We are very pleased to see how the United Nations has effectively contributed to peace-making and peacekeeping over the years.  In this context, we pay special tribute to the Secretary-General and to the members of the Security Council, where timely decisions on appropriate measures have been taken. They have greatly facilitated the progress made during the past year.
At the same time, international peace-building efforts through programmes of reconstruction, humanitarian aid and decent cooperation are rightly considered a elementary element to the settles of conflicts, such as 'operation Life-line' in Sudan. Austria has a long tradition of actively supporting the United Nations in its peace-keeping efforts. More than 28,000  Austrians, roughly every eighth Austrian soldier, have served with United Nations peace-keeping forces during the past30 years. Austria currently participates in seven of the ten United Nations peace-keeping operations.
On the basis of our long-term experience in peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts we know that every issue has to be settled on the specific merits and conditions of each region.  Nevertheless, we believe that the progress achieved in confidence- and security-building measures within  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) may also be of interest to other regions.  Austria is prepared to organize, in co-operation with the United Nations, an international seminar on this  subject for which it will also draw on the experience of experts from participating States of the CSCE  process. Such a seminar could be held in Austria in 1991.
The crisis in Lebanon. with its tragic consequences of continuing bloodshed and victimization of innocent individuals and the civilian population, is a matter of outmost concern to us. We firmly believe that a lasting solution can only he found on the basis of respect for the national unity, territorial integrity and full independence of Lebanon. We support the peace plan of the Tripartite High Arab Committee and welcome the results so far achieved. Let me express the hope that this agreement will pave the way at last for a final peaceful settlement.
With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, we continue to support the idea of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the Palestinian people. That conference would be the most appropriate instrument for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. We regret any escalation of violence. The excessive use of force and the continued violations of human rights in the occupied territories have become increasingly intolerable for the international community, which strives more and more for universal respect of human rights. 
We welcome the recent peace proposal of President Mubarak of Egypt and firmly hope his initiative will be successful. 
The process towards Namibia's independence for which the UN has accepted special responsibility, together with the UN peace-keeping efforts in areas which have been prey to conflict and bloodshed, exemplify the major role of the UN in settlement of highly sensitive international issues. This process could be a source of inspiration in the search for solution to the Middle east problem. 
Independence for Namibia in on its way. Special care and vigilance will be necessary to assure that elections in November can take place in an atmosphere and under conditions which will allow for a plebiscite free from intimidation., Austria has provided a contingent of police officers to participate in the work of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). UNTAG deserves our full appreciation of its accomplishes under most difficult conditions. We look forward to welcoming Namibia as an independent nation at next year's session of the General Assembly.
The recent elections in South Africa without the participation of the black majority have shown one more that the inhumane system of apartheid must be abolished, we hope that the new South African President will undertake the necessary steps without further delay, it is to be emphasized, however, that all steps taken by South Africa must lead to the complete eradication of apartheid, avoiding bloodshed and confrontation.
Austria's position with regard to Cambodia has remained unchanged over the years. We have always condemned the abhorrent violation of the most fundamental human rights, but we have also repeatedly stressed that military interventions cannot resolve conflicts. The withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops, which is presently under way, will significantly enhance the chances for a settlement. We regret that the endeavours towards reaching a negotiated solution, including the most recent Paris Conference, so far remain without concrete results.
Having recently been entrusted with the presidency of the International Conference on Kampuchea, I shall spare no effort to contribute to the peace process in the region. I look forward to the moment when all Cambodians, in full sovereignty and independence, can open a new chapter in their nation's history.
As in Cambodia, in Afghanistan the ongoing hostilities have brought immense suffering upon the population. We strongly support the endeavours of the Secretary-General to initiate a peaceful settlement and the necessary international co-operation for the recovery of that war-torn country.  In line with our traditional commitment to the principle of universality, Austria has always welcomed the admission of sovereign countries to the world organisation. It is only logical, therefore, that we also support the aspirations of Korea to become a UN member. We are impressed by the efforts of the Central American nations to cope with their regional difficulties. In particular, we welcome the results of the Tela summit, which constitute a concrete step. The linkage between the effective employment of regional responsibilities and of the authority of the UN may become an exemplary case of regional peace-making. 
The continued imbalances in the world economy remain a source of world-wide Preoccupation. Austria is committed to far-reaching trade liberalization because it believes that this will contribute to stable growth and prosperity among nations. We consider that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round could mark the beginning of a new era of global cooperation with increased awareness of mutual interest and shared responsibilities among all nations.
The problems connected with the debt burden figure prominently on the international agenda. Their repercussions on the political and social stability of many debtor countries have now become even more visible. Extreme poverty and hunger remain rampant in many countries and regions, in the long term they have to be considered as a serious threat to peace and security.
The international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade must respond to these issues, which are at the centre of our development efforts.
While the interrelationship between economic and social development has to be adequately taken into account, a more thorough look at the world social condition, particularly in developing countries, has become necessary.
Drug abuse is not only a social problem. It also affects the political and economic stability of nations. This is corroborated by the fact that the annual turn-over of illicit drug trafficking has reached the staggering amount of $US 220 billion. Recent tragic events in several countries constitute a proof of the global character of this problem. We welcome the determination of the President of the United States to fight this cancer of mankind and fully support his recent proposals. As a visible symbol of our commitment to this noble cause I shall today sign the 1988 Vienna Convention on Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
Any society will command as much cohesion and stability as its constituent Parts, social changes and transformations have affected, and in some cases even threatened, the basic unit of society.- the family.
While family structures greatly vary in different national cultures, there is a general need to strengthen national programmes and international cooperation regarding protection of and support for the family. Austria therefore welcomes the decision of the forty-third session of the General Assembly, based on a proposal by Poland and other countries, to observe an International Year of the Family. Such a year could help to highlight the central function of the family in society. Peace and stability ultimately begin in the home.
While in some societies families still provide social and economic security to its members, in others families require public financial support in order successfully to perform their functions, which ultimately benefit everyone.
The equality of men and women generally enshrined in international as well as in national legal instruments still needs better translation into the reality of society. Family structures sometimes mask violence against women and children, a fact which requires decisive measures at all levels.
The continuous dialogue between the United States and the USSR has facilitated further progress in the area of disarmament and arms control. It presents an unprecedented chance for cooperation in the economic, scientific, cultural and humanitarian fields. A sentiment of mutual interdependence and common responsibility is growing.
We welcome the reform process generated by perestroika, which provides a historic opportunity for a new quality in East-West relations. The strengthening of human rights, -the democratisation of public life and the introduction of a socially-oriented market economy constitute essential elements of this reform process. The era of confrontation should be replaced by an era of co-operation.
 The Vienna Concluding Document of the conference on security and co-operation in Europe has strongly promoted cooperation among European nations. Austria's relations with the other countries of Western Europe are characterized by common values and close economic ties. Austria is a member of the Council of Europe. As a member of the European Free Trade Association we intensified our relationship with the European Community by concluding a free trade agreement in 1972. In July of this year Austria applied for membership in the European Community. We are firmly convinced that participation in the process of European integration is compatible with our status of permanent neutrality.
In conclusion, permit me briefly to touch upon the implementation of the Austro-Italian Accord on South Tyrol of 6 September 1946, which has been the subject of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV), the basis of these resolutions agreement was reached in 1969, between Austria and Italy concerning the regulation of regional autonomy by means of 137 concrete measures. Full implementation of these measures is the precondition for a complete settlement of this dispute. Last year I was able to report to the Assembly for the first time, after years of stagnation, that significant and substantive progress had been made and that relations between Austria and Italy had reached excellent levels. This positive trend continued during the past 12 months. We are particularly satisfied with the formal implementation of measures aiming at the equality of the Italian and German languages. This is of fundamental importance for the protection of the German-speaking population.
The major part of the measures still to be implemented concerns issues where the Government of Italy has already been active on the basis of the 1969 agreement. However, in view of certain developments in the legal field in Italy, additional commentary measures are now necessary in order to assure the protection of the German-speaking population of South Tyrol in a way agreed upon with Austria.
Austria is convinced that the present Italian Government is fully aware of the problems and dangers inherent in a further delay in the full implementation of the 1969 agreement. We are confident that on the basis of the implementation of all remaining measures we shall soon be able to make a declaration to the United Nations stating that we consider the dispute with Italy settled.
The recent developments in the relationship between the two super-Powers, the success achieved in solving several regional conflicts, the progress in the implementation of human rights and the general trend towards more openness in international relations, whatever the shortcomings of the existing world order may be, give us reason to be optimistic and encourage us to make further active contributions towards achieving a better world.
","Three and a half centuries after Hugo Grotius, the famous Dutch philosopher, founded the modern concept of international law, the United Nations Charter now outlaws the use of military force in international relations. However, the deteriorating situation of ethnic and religious minorities in certain European States since the adoption of the Vienna Concluding document clearly shows the wide gap between commitments and realities in this field, as history has amply demonstrated, citizens will identify with their Governments only to the extent that basic rights and freedoms are guaranteed. Hence it is only natural that Austria actively participates in international co-operation on environment, hosting international conferences on such important issues as climatic changes, the use of tropical forests and the protection of the ozone layer. While the interrelationship between economic and social development has to be adequately taken into account, a more thorough look at the world social condition, particularly in developing countries, has become necessary. The recent developments in the relationship between the two super-Powers, the success achieved in solving several regional conflicts, the progress in the implementation of human rights and the general trend towards more openness in international relations, whatever the shortcomings of the existing world order may be, give us reason to be optimistic and encourage us to make further active contributions towards achieving a better world."
44,1989,POL,"ï»¿
 I should like to convey to Mr. Joseph Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at the forty-fourth session. I wish him every success in his important mission.
The Polish delegation also addresses its best wishes to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Recently it has been our honour to have the Secretary-General as our guest in Poland. We wish to express to him our great appreciation and full support for his indefatigable endeavours to ease international tension and solve regional conflicts.
The Assembly meets on the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. That war began in and against Poland as a result of aggression committed by the Nazi Government of Germany and executed in collusion with the Stalinist Government of the Soviet Union. At the same time those two Governments concluded a series of agreements that provided for the partition of Poland and its liquidation as a State. The agreements also concerned the fate of other countries in the region. All those arrangements went against international morality and conflicted with various treaties and fundamental and peremptory rules of general international law. The agreements were thus null and void from their very inception. Yet they were put into effect by their signatories, and as a result, they have brought about extreme suffering afflicting millions in that part of Europe.
 I am aware of the fact that the Assembly is not a place for historical reminiscences. However, I have mentioned the war for three reasons. First, we must have a full and definite clarification of what happened immediately before and during the war. That is necessary in order to eliminate the influence some past events still exercise on an essential part of our contemporary international
relations - and nay yet have an impact in the future - and on the reaction of public opinion in the respective countries. Secondly, we must make the United Nations more effective in its task of preventing armed conflicts. In that field the record of the Organization is less than perfect. Thirdly, 50 years ago frontiers and territorial acquisitions were at stake. Today, much emphasis must be put on the duty of all State not to question the frontiers and on the obligation to treat frontiers as inviolable. Some recent debates on territorial issues did more harm than good.
The past year has seen many important and favourable changes on the international scene. The development of East-West relations is to a large extent auspicious - including relations between the United states of America and the Soviet Union. Signs of rapprochement can be observed in new contacts and new areas of co-operation between the States of Eastern and Western Europe. Poland takes and will take an active part in that trend.
The extinction or mitigation of some regional conflicts also contributes to the overall improvement of the international situation. This is a development in which the United Nations has recently had a major role. Poland endorses the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Consequently, Poland has dispatched military contingents and observer groups for duty in a number of the United Nations peace-keeping and observer missions.
But let us take a broader view. At this particular juncture the Organization has a chance to map out the ways of resolving the key problems which beset mankind. These problems include relieving the burden of the arms race, enhancing living standards, preventing further degradation of the environment, and problems of international law, in particular the protection of human rights.
Let me begin with the problem of armaments. In our view, the top priorities are limitation of armaments, progressive elimination of nuclear weapons, and elaboration of an effective system of supervision. The world needs new and far-reaching disarmament agreements in which all States would have their fair share. Such agreements should concern all types of armaments in all areas of the world.
We believe that all States, whatever their size and strength, bear responsibility for disarmament. Without detracting from the obvious role of the major Powers, each and every State should seek to initiate and promote disarmament measures, including steps of a unilateral character.
Poland has been present in that field for a long time. More than 30 years ago the Polish Government submitted proposals for a nuclear-free zone in Europe. Though they did not materialize, they did introduce the very idea into diplomatic thinking and practice.
Poland has been taking an active part in the work of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. We assume that the Conference will shortly produce a balanced draft treaty eliminating, once and forever, chemical weapons. The determination of many States to reach agreement on that important matter has been confirmed, among others by the Paris Conference of States Parties to the Geneva Protocol of 1925.
Naturally, Poland focuses its attention on Europe, but does that not only because it is a European country. In Europe, in spite of detente, we still have the largest concentration and, therefore, the heaviest concentration and confrontation of the armed forces of the two Power blocs. Hence, the Polish idea of making their military doctrines more defensive and less confrontational. Hence, also, the emphasis on political means of ensuring security, in contradistinction to measures of a strictly military nature. During the recent meeting of the Political Consultative Committee, the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty reaffirmed their readiness to engage, together with other interested States, in a common search for agreements with a view to eliminating all weapons of mass destruction, radically reducing conventional armed forces, preventing the arms races from spreading to outer space, gradually limiting industrial production for military purposes and significantly cutting back military expenditures.
On its part, Poland has been making a specific contribution to the limitation of armaments in Europe. The Polish Government decided to reduce its armed forces by the end of 1990 by some 40,000 soldiers, 850 main battle tanks, 900 artillery guns and mortars, 700 armoured vehicles and 80 combat aircraft. The Government also decided to eliminate a number of other items of military technical equipment.
At the same time, the Polish Government is also working to develop a new approach to regional disarmament in Europe. Poland has submitted a plan to decrease armaments and increase confidence in Central Europe. That is the Jaruzelski Plan. Motivated by the same aspiration, we take an active part in the Vienna talks of the 23 and 35 States. It is with satisfaction that we take note of the proposals made in regard to conventional forces in Europe at the summit session of the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We are determined to do our utmost to make it possible for the first accord to be reached in 1990.
I now turn to the economic problems, particularly the problem of living standards. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening. Many countries have entered into economic regression. Incidentally, this is also the case of Poland. In the long run this situation will hurt everybody because it will lead to an eruption of social discontent on an unprecedented scale. The effects of such an upheaval may well cripple the interdependent world economy, for nowadays development has become indivisible. What we need is a new consensus on growth and development capable of bringing about an economic order that would be more efficient and of greater use to all groups of States, particularly those that remain under-privileged. We should reach such a consensus next year, during the special session of the General Assembly. We 3hould then start work on the elaboration and adoption of the International Development Strategy for the 1990s.
It is becoming imperative to co-ordinate national economic policies in order to reduce instability and unpredictability and to enhance International economic security.
We still face the global debt problem. Its magnitude, its persistence and the massive damage it inflicts on the development process in debtor countries and on the world economy are difficult to grasp. Some would assume that after a period of adjustment the debtor countries would return to financial viability and would grow and develop again. That assumption has not materialized. My country is particularly disturbed by the lack of significant progress in achieving a solution to the debt problem of the middle-income countries. In view of the Polish experience, I must tell members frankly that without debt reduction, national economic policies and austerity measures, no matter how vigorous and stringent, will remain but paper measures.
There should be a resumption of capital flows to indebted countries in the framework of an open international trading system. The adjustment effort, which are painful on the social plane, are likely to fail if there is no external support. And there is a pressing need for multilateral schemes. All this would amount to a 'debt-with-growth' strategy.
May I add that the difficulty of some States is aggravated by the transfer of resources from the developing countries to the highly industrialized regions. I shall not deal at length with the economic problems of Poland. We realize that help must come from within, yet we seek reasonable assistance coming from abroad.
At the same time I can assure the Assembly that the process of liberalization of our trade regime is well advanced and this year a new customs tariff became effective. Moreover, we intend to modify our present formal status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in order to be put on an equal footing with other countries.
Against this background I should like, on behalf of my Government, to express our thanks to all countries that have responded to the recommendations of the Western economic summit and launched a special programme of economic assistance to Poland. Let me observe that this assistance transcends the realm of economic action. It has a broader sense because it helps to overcome the division of Europe.
I also feel it necessary to make some remarks on international law and human rights.
Apart from drafting treaties the General Assembly has its own methods of influencing the law-declaring or law-making process. I am thinking of the adoption of resolutions laying down rules of conduct for States. Certain branches or divisions of contemporary international law owe their origin to the initiatives undertaken by the Assembly along these lines.
The manner, however, in which the Assembly fulfils that role is sometimes open to doubt, and it is not without its flaws. The Organization and its Members have not succeeded in stopping the inflation of resolutions, and this statement also applies to some instruments, which aspire to a role in law-making. More often than not the dividing line between law and non-law is blurred. I think that the use of resolutions for declaring existing law and for suggesting new law should be more selective. There is still much room for improvement regarding procedures in this field more extensive preparatory work, elimination of haste, more insistence on agreed solutions - in contradistinction to those imposed by majorities - and much greater use of legal expertise. In the latter respect the Assembly could take more advantage of the International Law Commission.
This observation leads me to say a few words about that organ which has rendered so many services to the cause of international law.
The International Law Commission was restructured some time ago, but there are still doubts regarding its composition, methods of work and results. The influence of politics on the elections to the Commission has had some bad consequences. There is some connection between that problem and the value and authority of the Commissionâs drafts. As to the choice of subjects, one may suggest that the Commission should not avoid the great legal issues of our time. The Commission's prudence is proof of its wisdom; yet, more imagination would enhance the process of law-making. The Commission should respond to the global challenges we face. It is only then that the Commission will be able to fulfil its mandate under the Charter.
In the important field of the judicial settlement of disputes Poland intends to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice according to Article 36 of its Statute. We think that the obligatory jurisdiction of the Court should be enhanced and supported.
Poland attaches major weight to the implementation of human rights. We put forward the idea of, and then initiated the work on, the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We hope that this Convention will be adopted at the present session. We intend to accede to some instruments which are not yet binding on us.
In the first place we intend to accept the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We also look forward to the day when it will be possible for us to become a member of the Council of Europe and to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.
I now come to my last point, which is Polish foreign policy seen against the background of our obligations under the Charter and the political changes now taking place in my country.
Poland has a geo-strategic location that makes its position militarily significant. This has a bearing on the whole region. Yet, I believe that one can control the consequences of this objective fact, or at least try to do it, so as to base Polish foreign policy firmly on the fundamentals of external sovereignty and internal independence. Poland will do its best to maintain peace, freedom and good-neighbourly co-operation in Europe.
In other words, without disregarding the facts, we have a vision of peace and freedom in a region which, in contemporary history, has been too often one of conflict, division and domination. If Poland is free and democratic, then its geopolitical and geostrategic importance could and should be turned into an asset that supports peace and fosters freedom.
Until recently the role of the ideological factor in international relations - at any rate among many States - has been considerable. Now that role is greatly reduced and the present Polish Government welcomes this development. We shall strive for the total elimination of ideology from inter-State relations, which does . not mean that we reject international morality. Ideology and morality are different things. Morality and respect for the human person remain our highest values.
I am convinced that the present reform movement in Poland is a good sign for the world and, more particularly, for Europe. The new Polish Government, under the imaginative leadership of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, has no intention whatsoever to destabilize the existing international order and, in particular, one of its components, that is the mutual strategic security involving the two super-Powers. However, spheres of security can never mean spheres of influence. We regard changes such as those now taking place in Poland as an element of the disengagement of the super-Powers from their long-standing confrontation in the heart of Europe.
The key issue of Polish political strategy lies in our relations with the Soviet Union. We shall respect existing treaties and we firmly believe in mutual respect for national interests. Yet such respect does not impose any limitations regarding the choice and change of the system of government. The present Polish Government acts in such a way that the promotion of our vital interests is not in conflict with the interests of others.
We shall contribute to the recreation of a united Europe, in which Poland should have its place. The most recent step in that direction is our treaty with the European Economic Community. We highly appreciate the friendly and helpful attitude of the Community presided over by France.
Politics do not boil down to the mere application of some purported laws of history. Personally, I do not believe in the existence of such laws. Destiny can wait, but the time has now come and Poland must shape its fate. We count on our friends in the United Nations.
","Without detracting from the obvious role of the major Powers, each and every State should seek to initiate and promote disarmament measures, including steps of a unilateral character. Against this background I should like, on behalf of my Government, to express our thanks to all countries that have responded to the recommendations of the Western economic summit and launched a special programme of economic assistance to Poland. Yet, I believe that one can control the consequences of this objective fact, or at least try to do it, so as to base Polish foreign policy firmly on the fundamentals of external sovereignty and internal independence.

44,1989,GNB,"ï»¿Mr. Garba's election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly is for my country, Guinea-Bissau, a source of great satisfaction. His qualities as a wise and experienced diplomat and his deep knowledge of the United Nations system and the major world problems all guarantee enlightened leadership in the work of this session.
We are pleased that the unanimous choice of the international community has tills year beer, the representative of Nigeria, to which Guinea-Bissau Is tied by particular links of friendship, fraternity and co-operation. I assure him of our full co-operation.
The excellent work done by his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, equally merits our full appreciation and thanks. We should also like to make a special mention of the Secretary-General of our Organist ion, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his perspicacious and innovative leadership of the United Nations and for his personal contribution to strengthening the role and prestige of the Organization.
His report on the work of the Organization certainly reflects the complexity of the problems still facing the world; but it also reflects the efforts made by the United Nations over the past year to consolidate the ongoing peace process in some regions of the world, lessen dangers and attenuate conflicts in other areas of the planet. It also speaks of the specific initiatives aimed at strengthening international co-operation with regard to peace, security and development.
The past year has been marked by events of great importance for mankind that seemed to confirm the depth of the changes occurring in the world in recent years.
In this context the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia is doubtless one of the most significant events in world political life, an event whose effects go far beyond the borders of that African country. Namibia's independence will mark a decisive stage in the process off total liberation of the African continent and usher in a new era in the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa to establish a lasting peace and a climate of trust, understanding and co-operation in the region.
The process of dialogue already begun in Angola and Mozambique, thanks to the openness aid clear desire for peace demonstrated by the Governments of these two countries, deserves the unanimous support of the international community. There are numerous examples in contemporary history of international solidarity and joint action to meet the aspirations and common interests of mankind, especially when these aspirations and interests are linked to international peace and security. The positive developments in the world political climate are largely the result of an awareness that the growing interdependence and integration in the world is in the common interest.
Detente between the two super-Powers, the tendency towards lasting peaceful solutions, the establishment of dialogue and harmony over confrontation and use of force, as well as the primacy of law in the settlement of disputes between States, are new exerting a growing influence in structuring international relations at the end of this century. Thus we note with satisfaction the encouraging progress made in solving the questions of Western Sahara and Kampuchea and in working out a final settlement of the Chad-Libya dispute.
Solidarity in the struggle to preserve the environment or against such destructive scourges as terrorism and drugs is a positive sign allowing foe a new vision of the future.
But in speaking of the future we must now take into account the current negative aspects that daily continue to weigh heavily upon mankind.
The persistence of the apartheid system in South Africa, repression in Palestine, confrontations between communities in Lebanon, the tragic situation in East Timor and the tensions still afflicting others areas in the world - especially in the Korean peninsula, Afghanistan and Cyprus - as well as the remaining vestiges of colonialism in some regions - all are still, unfortunately, matters of great concern to the international community, to which must be added the social and economic problems affecting much of mankind.
The elimination of extreme poverty and misery in the world and meeting essential human needs - such as hygiene, health, education and housing - remain formidable challenges for individuals. States and the international community as a whole. The overwhelming majority of the world's population is daily confronted with shortages an& disease as a result of conditions of extreme deprivation.
Africa, for example, is poorer today than it was 20 years ago. The World Bank predicts that this decline will continue over the next 10 years.
According to tine Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, if the trends of recent years continue, per capita food production will continue to fall until the year 2010, and food self-sufficiency in Africa south of the Sahara will decrease by 85 per cent. The cereal deficit will increase from 20 million to 100 million tons, and food imports will reach, in constant prices, the figure of 32.5 billion, the equivalent of twice the amount envisaged for agricultural exports.
What can be said of this indebtedness and its harmful consequences for our economies? The developing countries' debt service exceeds very greatly the flow of foreign capital, a situation that will worsen if urgent measures are not adopted to reverse this trend. The continued fall in the prices of our countries' products in international markets is a grave and constant obstacle to our development efforts.
It is logical, therefore, that the question of development should be the focus of the international community's concerns and should no longer be regarded simply as 'assistance'.
Development problems should be analysed in terms of concrete measures to guarantee minimal living standards and progress for all, by stimulating growth and promoting beneficial interaction between the economies of the developed and developing countries.
This is really a major imperative of our times and a vital prerequisite for the full affirmation and enjoyment of mankind's political, economic and cultural rights. The adoption of appropriate and courageous measures to solve developing countries' economic and social problems is indeed a genuine priority, and tackling these problems requires now more than ever the eradication of their underlying causes. In tills context it is essential to stress the need for a new coexistence between States based on solidarity and reciprocity, a partnership consciously assumed by each one of us in a world where the ability of a small number of economically strong States to affect positively or negatively the future of the majority of mankind has never been as great or as real.
This coexistence will require the final elimination of the psychological gap between the northern countries and the southern countries and the promotion of a constructive global dialogue on issues of vital importance for all mankind. But, as Amilcar Cabral stated. 'To coexist, one must first exist.' The real challenge is not to ensure the survival of disinherited populations, but rather to create conditions that guarantee their full rights and basic freedoms, and the blossoming of their creative abilities, making it possible for them to determine, consciously and responsibly, the best way to achieve development compatible with their true aspirations and the needs of our times. We believe it is this process that will ultimately yield true freedom for us, because, in our times, any scientific, technological or economic backwardness will inevitably affect the present and mortgage the future.
The special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to international co-operation scheduled for 1990, will offer an appropriate framework for joint reflection on the best way to resume a constructive global dialogue on questions of development. We expect from the developed countries the openness and commitment that will make it possible to bring a new dynamism into international economic relations.
The international development strategy for the 1990s must also reflect the commitment, desire and will of the entire community of nations to make the next decade a period of profound changes conducive to the economic rebirth of the third world countries. Mankind will then be able to begin the next millennium on new bases and to correct the imbalances created by unequal development in the twentieth century.
In this regard, we should stress at this time the role of the united Nations, a role which is irreplaceable in the constant search for peace, the strengthening of International co-operation and development. The results obtained in carrying out this mission have made the Organization more credible and effective today and has earned it the confidence of mankind. The strengthening of the United Nations Is the most tangible expression of the unique nature and unity of mankind's aspirations and indicates that multilateralism, without which no world problem can truly be resolved, is as vital as ever. We are certain that ever more impressive results will be achieved in our quest for peace, world security and development.
Our joint march along this path is the only viable choice for mankind. We must have the courage to take that path if we truly wish to build a more prosperous and more equitable future and to adjust to our world by better preserving it from any threat to its balance and potential prosperity. Therefore, the rich countries and the poor countries must build together a new humanism that will confirm our shared desire and will to make irreversible the present changes, which are so necessary for the establishment of a new type of relationship between States, based on the vision of a world with greater solidarity.

The real challenge is not to ensure the survival of disinherited populations, but rather to create conditions that guarantee their full rights and basic freedoms, and the blossoming of their creative abilities, making it possible for them to determine, consciously and responsibly, the best way to achieve development compatible with their true aspirations and the needs of our times."

Mr. President, on behalf of my delegation and on my own personal behalf, I wish to extend our felicitations to you, Sir, upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session. Your great country, Nigeria, and my own enjoy the warmest of relations, it is our conviction that with your immense diplomatic skills you will ably guide our deliberations. Please be assured of my delegation's unwavering support. I take this opportunity also to convey our gratitude to your predecessor for a job well done during the last session. The forty-fourth session has convened at a time when he mood in international relations is still characterized by the spirit of detente. Relations between the super-Powers have continued to improve. Some measure of co-operation has been clearly demonstrated in finding solutions to regional conflicts. We note in this regard that the independence process in Namibia is registering significant progress.
It is our earnest hope that the momentum will be maintained and infused into the outstanding political issues that confront us. The United Nations has played a key role, and the Secretary-General deserves our encouragement to carry on with this impressive work. Be that as it may, much still remains to be done mainly in the socio-economic sphere. The trade imbalances between the rich North and the poor South is as bad as it has been in the past, if not worse. The decline in the prices of commodities continues unabated. Hunger, poverty, disease and other social ills remain the order of the day in third world countries. With this background in mind it is for the Assembly at this session to revisit the issues, and to reoriente itself to proffer meaningful solutions. In this connection I believe that we can only succeed if we resolve to work together to find common solutions to world problems.
As I mentioned earlier, significant progress has been registered in international politics. The two super-Powers have moved ahead in the spirit of detente. Important steps such as the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - have raised new expectations that disarmament in both nuclear and conventional arms may be pursued earnestly and purposefully. It is our desire that more of such brave measures will be undertaken. Any positive development in international relations is hound to produce a snowball effect even in other areas. Such developments have our blessing and encouragement. regional conflicts whose escalation we have always feared to be a potential for another international conflict appear more on the decline, thanks to the atmosphere of rapprochement between the super-powers and the very important role played by the United Nations. To date the loud and haunting guns of the Gulf have been silenced after spelling death, misery and disaster in that part of the globe. We are hopeful that peace will be allowed to prevail. As for the situation in Afghanistan, we regret that the Geneva Agreements which were concluded last year under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General have not been observed and carried to their logical conclusion.
We call upon all parties concerned to abide by these Accords. The Afghan people should be encouraged to lay down their arms and move to the negotiating table without fail to embark on national reconciliation and reconstruction of their country. The situation in South-East Asia is hopefully moving in the right direction. The spirit of the recent international conference held in Paris on the question of Kampuchea, particularly the withdrawal of foreign troops, would, if honestly pursued, usher in a new phase in the long-drawn-out quest for peace. We trust that this initiative will not be lost, as the people of Kampuchea are yearning for peace and national reconciliation. There should be no return to the killing fields of the 1970s.
Similarly, we call upon all concerned to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the question of Korea. Both North and South Korea desire a peaceful reunification of their divided country. Let us help them to achieve that objective.
Botswana welcomes the peace process launched at Tela, Honduras, by the summit meeting of Heads of State or Government of the countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. These are indeed encouraging signs towards the freaking of the stalemate in Central America. We call upon all concerned to assist in the promotion of this initiative.
We note with concern that the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate despite the peace initiatives taken by Palestine to accept Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which initiatives cleared the way for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East question. It is now for Israel to reciprocate if peace is to be achieved. What now stands in the way of peace is Israel's acts of aggression in the region, its human rights violations against the Palestinian people and its refusal to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Botswana still pins its hopes on the peaceful resolution of disputes. That is why we support the idea of convening an international conference on the question of the Middle East at which the PLO would be allowed to participate on an equal footing. In Lebanon we continue to witness untold killings and counter-killings and the wanton destruction of property. Botswana holds the view that the people of Lebanon must be assisted to stop this fratricidal war and the destruction of their country. We call for the removal of all foreign troops and other occupation elements. The Lebanese people should be allowed to resolve their differences without external interference.
Cyprus still remains a divided and unhappy island of people who desire peace and national unity. We call upon the two parties concerned to breathe life into the process of resolving differences through peaceful means, in this regard we encourage the holding of more purposeful consultations through inter-communal talks. Let no effort be spared to foster the noble goal of achieving peace and unity. In this vein Botswana stands by its conviction that all foreign troops must be removed from Cyprus. Southern Africa continues to be in a state of war. while we can register same Progress on the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), on the independence of Namibia, much remains at stake on all other fronts. Apartheid, which is the root cause of the problems in our subregion, remains intact. The front-line States and other neighbouring countries continue to endure South Africa's acts of aggression and destabilization. Our citizens live in fear for their lives and the destruction of their property. Bomb scares and actual bomb blasts continue to occur in Botswana. Refugees under our care remain targets for South African security forces or commando murder squads and ordinary civilians are victimized in the process. We do not expect much improvement in this situation until apartheid has been totally eradicated and replaced by a democratic system. That is our only hope for peace and stability in southern Africa.
As indicated earlier, some progress is being registered on the independence process in Namibia, but we remain concerned about a number of obstacles to the holding of free and fair elections. Instead of demobilizing all Koevoet members, the South African Administrator-General confined to base only 1,200 members. He has pledged to reactivate them if he feels there is a need for them.
Koevoet is notorious for its brutality during the independence war. It continues to be a symbol of harassment and intimidation and should not at this time be used for the maintenance of law and order, it is with the foregoing in mind that we condemn the recent cold-blooded murder of Anton Labowski as a dastardly act. Another source of serious concern is the electoral proclamation, which has been described by many as 'seriously flawed'. The system proposed is complex and therefore subject to abuse. A more simple, universally used and time-tested procedure that can be understood by the people of Namibia should be adopted. There certainly should be a common voters' roll prepared region by region. Ballots should be counted at the centre where voting has taken place. That will ensure speedy announcement of results and reduce the risk of fraud and loss of or tampering with ballot boxes during transportation to Windhoek.
Namibians have waited for their independence for a long time, and they should be assisted to achieve it. The international community has worked hard to bring the process this far. Our efforts should not be in vain. We must, therefore, as individuals, as pressure groups and as Governments, do all in our power to ensure that free and fair elections are held in Namibia so that that country can proceed to independence.
In Angola there are promising signs that the civil war that has ravaged that country ever since its independence some 14 years ago my come to an end. The reconciliation talks under the mediation of President Mobuto Seko Seko of Zaire offer prospects for an end to the war. violations of the cease-fire are a source of concern. We appeal to the parties concerned to rekindle the spirit of Gbadolite and undertake to rebuild mutual trust. We also believe that recriminations and acrimony will not help. Everything must be done to make the work of the mediator effective, and nothing should be done to tarnish the mediator's integrity. We call upon those in a position to do ,o to persuade UNITA to re-enter the negotiations with a sense of purpose. The people of Angola have suffered long enough as a result of the war. They want peace and development in their country. 
The Mozambican Government also has agreed to negotiate the ending of the war with the RENAMO bandits. President Arap Moi of Kenya and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe have agreed to act as mediators. Church leaders in Mozambique are trying to act as special envoys between the two sides. Their work is not being made easy by RMAMO, which continues to murder and maim innocent civilians even after the declaration of a cease-fire. The untold suffering imposed on the people of Mozambique by RENAMO should not be allowed to continue. Mozambique is very important to us in the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). Since Botswana is a member of that regional organization, whose objective is to forge regional economic integration and reduce dependence, especially on South Africa, I know how much the war is costing all of us. 
Despite international assistance and support to the Maputo harbour and railway system, that corridor remains virtually closed to traffic because of REM WO activities. The whole region is being denied the use of a deep-sea port, and Mozambique the revenue the reform. The situation in South Africa itself remains unchanged. The abhorrent and violent system of apartheid continues. The authentic leaders of the black majority remain incarcerated or in forced exile. The state of emergency remains in force. Peaceful demonstrations are met with brutal force. On the day of the white elections 23 innocent people were reported killed by the security forces and over 100 hurt. The situation remains very tense, particularly in and around Cape Town. Unfortunately, the full extent of the tension cannot be known because of official Press censorship. Church buildings and church leaders are not being revered in a country that professes to be God-fearing.
 Despite the violent repression unleashed against them by the security forces, the people of South Africa are still seeking ways and means of finding a peaceful alternative to apartheid. Through the mass democratic movement they are organizing peaceful defiance campaigns to end apartheid. They are taking the Government at its word that apartheid is dead. Their demonstrations seem to be well organized, peaceful and dignified. They go out of their way to avoid provoking the trigger-happy State security forces, but the police always find some excuse to attack them. That two demonstrations recently received the presidential nod seems to signal a hesitant softening. The South African Government must be bold. The oppressed majority of black people have on those occasions demonstrated that they can be self-disciplined. On 21 August 1989 at Harare, Zimbabwe, the Organization of African Unity adopted a 24-point Declaration on measures to end apartheid. The Declaration had been formulated by the front-line States with the assistance and involvement of the people of South Africa through their liberation movements. That Declaration enjoys the popular support of the people of South Africa. It really demonstrates that the oppressed majority remain committed to the peaceful eradication of apartheid.
In his campaign statements Mr. F.W. de Klerk spoke about his desire to end apartheid. He requested to be given five years to address the South African situation, although he did not give any indication of what exactly his plans entail. His statements have attracted considerable attention and raised hopes in some quarters. His eagerness and his ability to meet foreign leaders have also attracted attention. In certain quarters he is seen as a reformer who must be given a chance. We hope he means what he says and that he will soon put South Africa on the road to civilization. Botswana would wish to encourage him to start the process of dialogue from within South Africa itself. He has to talk to the leaders of the oppressed majority. Charity begins at home. 
In thanking the white electorate for having voted his party into power give full political rights to all South Africans. Those are noble words that must be matched by concrete action. The oppressed majority has already declared its serious Intention to negotiate. We urge him to take this challenge very seriously indeed. In this regard. Mr. de Klerk should create a climate conducive to negotiations by releasing all political prisoners and detainees, by ending the ban on political parties and other anti-apartheid organizations, by lifting the state of emergency and by removing the army from the townships. The protection of the so-called group rights, for which Mr. de Klerk is calling, cannot he helpful to that process, as it is apartheid by another name. Universal human rights and adult suffrage are the hallmarks of true democracy. Until free and fair elections are conducted for all the people of that country, there should be no let-up in the guest for peace and democracy in south Africa. Apartheid must be abolished completely, not reformed. We must establish a democratic non-racial society in south Africa.
Vestiges of colonial domination still dot our globe, with painfully slew movement, if any, towards decolonization. We call for freedom and Justice for all colonial peoples. In that connection we call for the speedy implementation of United Nations resolutions relating to the question of Western Sahara, to the Comorian island of Mayotte and to New Caledonia. In each case we believe that dialogue rather than force should be used to settle any differences between the parties concerned. It is in the same spirit that we encourage Argentina and Britain to resolve their differences on the question of the Falklands/Malvinas through negotiations. We do not in any way prescribe what they should negotiate.
The world economic system shows little signs of improvement. The recently released report of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) indicates that international trade has registered some 8 per cent growth, owing in part to technological innovations. But the irony of it all is that the registered increase does not affect third world countries. They still suffer hardships owing to the continued decline in commodity prices and to protectionist practices of the industrialized countries. Efforts by developing countries to acquire capital, science and technology from the developed countries have been frustrated. Our economic dependence on the developed world has thus increased. The debt crisis is of particular concern to developing countries. We have to service the immense external debt from the meagre resources which accrue from the sale of our primary products. Most of our economies have, ultimately, registered negative growth rates, while some have stagnated. Traumatized as we are, we have not been spared a moment to think of a way out of our predicament which would be consistent with our individual socio-political circumstances. Instead, prescriptive advice under the umbrella of structural adjustment programmes has been given us by some of the so-called experts within the circles of international financial institutions and donor countries. While structural adjustment programmes may be necessary at times, as we in Botswana have noted, they should not be regarded as a panacea for all our economic problems, as this attitude sometimes results in the 'cure' being worse than the disease. In our view, there is a need to consult the countries concerned and take into account their socio-political condition, without imposing anything on them.
The critical economic situation prevailing in Africa should be viewed against this backdrop of an adverse international economic climate. The programmes envisaged under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development (UNPAAERD) have so far not been implemented. African countries still face some degree of anguish. It is desirable, therefore, for the international donor agencies and financial institutions to redouble their efforts to help out in this pitiful situation. Failure to do so would mean a perpetuation of misery, hopelessness, at times death.
 Botswana shares the hope that developing countries may be able to maximize their economic development by way of economic integration. For our part, we are working tirelessly within the ambit of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference to realize this lofty goal. We therefore call upon the international community to give us the necessary support in this endeavour. On the social side, there is a need for all of us to pool our resources to combat the menace of drugs and drug trafficking. Our youth is being turned into a generation of addicts and social misfits. Similarly, joint efforts are desirable in our fight against the killer disease AIDS. We, the entire family of Man, need to rise above the level of our national boundaries and address with vigour these physical and social ills which threaten humanity.
Economic development cannot be separated from environmental issues. Our development plans must take full account of the possible consequences of our activities and be environmentally sound. We are concerned that the ozone layer is being depleted and that desertification continues unabated. Also, we deprecate the dumping of toxic and nuclear waste, particularly in the territory of developing countries. In that light, Botswana sees great value in mobilizing all our resources to combat this menace. We urge that there should be a common resolve to find more meaningful solutions to environmental problems.
In conclusion, I wish to make the observation that some measure of progress has been achieved in the political sphere, but that much remains to be done in the economic sphere. I believe that we can make meaningful progress in both areas if we all co-operate.
Finally, I wish to reiterate my delegation's best wishes to Mr. Garba in his presidency of this forty-fourth session.
","In this connection I believe that we can only succeed if we resolve to work together to find common solutions to world problems. We note with concern that the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate despite the peace initiatives taken by Palestine to accept Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which initiatives cleared the way for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East question. Refugees under our care remain targets for South African security forces or commando murder squads and ordinary civilians are victimized in the process. They go out of their way to avoid provoking the trigger-happy State security forces, but the police always find some excuse to attack them. Instead, prescriptive advice under the umbrella of structural adjustment programmes has been given us by some of the so-called experts within the circles of international financial institutions and donor countries."
44,1989,MRT,"ï»¿I have pleasure in extending to Mr. Garba, of Nigeria, the warm congratulations of the Mauritanian delegation on his well deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. This choice is an indication of the great respect and esteem that Nigeria enjoys on the international scene, and a tribute to the experience and personal qualities of Mr. Garba, whose leadership will guarantee achievement of the objectives that have been set for this session. I should like to pay tribute also to Mr. Garba's predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, with whose country - Argentina - we have friendly relations, for the high quality of the work that was done during the forty-third session. I want also to extend our congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless and devoted efforts towards the realization of this Organization's ideals of peace, justice and equality.
The continued improvement in the international political climate and the new prospects for a settlement of certain regional conflicts give rise to great hopes. Peace has started to become a reality for peoples that have been deprived of it for a long time. 
This process has made it possible, inter alia, to end hostilities between Iraq and Iran, conclude an agreement on Afghanistan, begin the process of implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the independence of Namibia, and pursue the mediation efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity relating to the settlement of the problem of the Western Sahara. While lauding the progress achieved in moving towards peace, Mauritania cannot but express its deep concern over the continuation of the Middle East conflict as well as the aggressive practices of the policy of racial discrimination committed against all the peoples of southern Africa.
The unshakeable solidarity of my country with the just and legitimate struggle of the Palestinian and the South African peoples has been a constant of our policy, which stems from the fact that we belong to both the Arab and the African worlds. Our geographical and human realities, as well as our history, qualify Mauritania to play an active and constructive role in this field. That role is manifested in our unremitting efforts to cement relations between those two worlds, as well as our active participation in all Arab and African organizations and sub regional groups in North Africa and in the southern Sahara. In this connection, the establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union on 17 February last in Marrakesh, was in response to the aspirations of all the peoples of the region, which have, for generations, longed for such a Union.
While positive elements of current international events in recent years are a source of pride and hope for the international community as a whole, regions of crises and tension remain where our serious and prompt efforts could bring about the necessary solutions. 
In this context, the question of the Western Sahara continues to be the focus of the attention of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations. The acceptance of the peace proposals of the Secretary-General by both parties concerned, and the initiation of a direct dialogue between the King of Morocco and the representatives of the POLISARIO Front last January, are welcome and positive elements. We sincerely hope that that question will be resolved in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible. That would undoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of a united Maghreb and of African Unity as a whole.
These signs of hope, unfortunately, do not emerge everywhere. In the Middle East, the valiant Palestinian people continues to suffer under oppressive Israeli occupation, despite the Palestinian resistance, which grows by the day. The intifadah launched almost two years ago is intensifying in such a way as to leave no doubt that it is not an ephemeral act but is a truly deep expression of the rejection by an entire people of foreign occupation. Therefore, the intifadah will never come to an end as long as the national rights of the Palestinian people continue to be denied.
The conscience of the whole world continues to be touched by this tragedy, which has been going on for more than 40 years. Today, a historic occasion is at hand to find a comprehensive, just and final solution to the Palestinian problem, which undoubtedly lies at the heart of the Middle East conflict. The brave decisions adopted by the last meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers and the peace message of Mr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PI/D) and head of the Palestinian State, sent to our Assembly at its previous session, are evidence of a sincere desire for peace. In this context, the beginning of an American-Palestinian dialogue is an encouraging sign.
But all those peaceful intentions and the desire for dialogue have encountered the intransigence of Israel, which persists in its practices, thinking that it can stop the course of history through the use of blind repression. It is up to all of us who have the power to bring influence to bear on the course of events to remove the last obstacle to peace, in compliance with the resolutions and recommendations repeatedly adopted by the General Assembly.
We continue to believe that the only possible way of achieving that result is by convening forthwith an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. That solution will necessarily have to lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with the Holy City of Al-Quds as its capital, and to the withdrawal of occupying forces from all occupied Arab territories.
If the situation remains highly precarious in the Middle East because of the expansionist Zionist policy, peace and security are no less threatened in southern Africa, where the shameful apartheid regime continues to commit the most heinous crimes against the peoples of that region.
The policy of violence which that regime has built into a system of government continually arouses the conscience of the entire world aid brings forth its condemnation. Patriots -such as Nelson Mandela still languish in South African gaols, and the most elementary rights are still denied the South African people. This policy has already been condemned as a crime against humanity and must not continue. We believe that comprehensive and mandatory sanctions ate necessary and that any attempt to delay or oppose them is tantamount to prolonging the suffering of the South African people.
As stated and demonstrated on many occasions, Mauritania will continue to support tirelessly the just struggle of the South African people until the odious system of apartheid is completely eradicated. In Namibia, hope grows anew with the incipient implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). After the terrible suffering endured during a lengthy, bitter and pitiless war for national liberation, signs of a final settlement are beginning to emerge as a reward for the Namibian people, who sacrificed life and property in their struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). At this critical juncture, however, when the destiny of an entire nation is at stake, it is necessary to be more vigilant and resolute until the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people have been completely achieved. While Mauritania commends the efforts made by all parties in order to achieve that result, it hopes and desires that the process thus begun will lead to the independence of Namibia, under the leadership of SWAPO, the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. 
In the Gulf the war between the neighbouring countries of Iraq and Iran has been ended thanks to the cease-fire that entered into force on 20 August 1988. Mauritania, which has always worked to bring an end to that destructive war, is pleased at the cessation of hostilities. It expresses its hope that direct negotiations will take place between the two parties, with no pre-conditions whatsoever, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General in order to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace that will restore stability to the region and enable the two peoples to devote their energies and resources to their own development efforts.
In Afghanistan, the Geneva Agreements of 14 April 1988 have led to the withdrawal of all foreign troops. My country cannot but welcome the impressive victory of the fraternal Muslim people of Afghanistan, who did not grudge any sacrifice for the sake of its freedom aid dignity. We hope that the Afghanis will be able to surmount their differences in order to tackle the task of rebuilding their country.
In Kampuchea, we take hope from the continuous efforts under way to reach a peaceful solution to its problems. That solution must be based on the many relevant and wise resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, all of which reaffirm the need for the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops and the free exercise by the Cambodian people of the right to self-determination.
In Central America, the peace process has been re-launched by the Tela agreement. Mauritania is pleased at that positive development and hopes that it will lead to the establishment of a just aid lasting peace in that region.
With regard to the Korean issue, my country has always advocated the peaceful reunification of the peninsula in the interest of all the Korean people. That reunification, however, must be the outcome of negotiations and dialogue. We are pleased at the initiatives taken by both sides in this connection aid we hope that they will rapidly be crowned with success.
The world economic situation remains a source of major concern. The industrialized countries have registered a significant expansion. But the economies of the developing countries are still deteriorating, in spite the major reforms and structural adjustment programmes undertaken by their Governments. The gap between developed and developing countries continues to grow, and the latter still face the decline In the prices of their main products, the overwhelming burden of debts, and the many obstacles to the transfer of technology.
The Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries have just reaffirmed at Belgrade that only the resumption of the North-South dialogue and global negotiations to establish a new international economic order can lead to the acceleration of the economic aid social development of developing peoples.
The interdependency of nations and the interaction of problems and interrelated interests call for such an approach. It is to be hoped that the Second United Nations Conference on the least Developed Countries and the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade will contribute to achievement of that goal.
The developing countries are particularly sorely tried by heavy indebtedness, repayment of which has nullified all their efforts towards development and has led to a situation whose overall outcome is to the benefit of the developed countries.
The urgent need to reverse that situation requires the deepening and expanding of the various initiatives that have been announced in tills connection. The initiatives taken by certain court tries such as the Bader al Republic of Germany, France and Canada deserve particular mention. 
The economic situation in Africa is still particularly critical. Per capita production in the continent has once again declined. Development efforts are still being impeded by external factors over which Africa has no control. Africa is also suffering from the tragic effects of drought, desertification, and the seasonal invasion of locusts. No African com try is capable alone of overcoming the combined effects of economic crisis and natural disasters. Nevertheless, African countries have undertaken major large-scale reforms, in keeping with the commitments entered into in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The co-operation that was to have been engendered by that Programme has not, however, materialized.
As a result, the responsibility of the international community remains undiminished in connection with the international communityâs contribution to the continent's economic recovery and development.
In the immediate future an appropriate solution to the debt problem must be sought, and the best way to do so remains, in our view, the convening of an international conference on the subject.
In national terms, Mauritania is continuing to implement the programme of economic reforms begun in 1985. It has just initiated a programme of economic recovery that has met with the support of our main financial markets, particularly our Arab brothers, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. That programme is aimed in the long term at ensuring self-sustaining development and socio-economic growth. The country's population is already participating effectively in that development effort thanks to widespread democratisation at the grass-roots level, which has made it possible for urban and rural municipalities to control their own independent management. 
The campaign against illiteracy is another important aspect of the development programme  A special State secretariat has been established to eradicate that scourge by the year 2000. Special attention is being given to the participation of women, who have been playing an increasingly active role in society. In order to institutionalise that role a ministry on the status of women was created a year ago.
I should like to take this opportunity to express our very deep gratitude to the countries and international organizations that have helped us to put our various development programmes into effect. Recently, when thousands of our citizens returned to the national territory under tragic circumstances, those friendly countries and international organizations quickly and generously participated in our efforts to reabsorb the returnees.
In our view, economic questions constitute the major challenge of our time, and for that reason they deserve special attention. The paradox here is that the resources of the Earth aid the degree of scientific and technological progress we have reached do make it possible to meet all the needs of mankind, but some States still apparently disregard this fact and are devoting to the arms race immense human, material and technological resources. There is a striking contrast between the hundreds of millions of dollars thus allocated to the manufacture, improvement and stockpiling of weapons and the deprivation and abject poverty in which two thirds of the world's population live. The stockpiling of weapons does not guarantee security: it gives rise to the arms race and festers suspicion among States. The time has come to put an end to this escalation, to resort always to peaceful means of settling disputes and to seek security in general and complete disarmament under effective international control.
We are pleased at the developments that have occurred over the past few years, but we still hope that further substantial progress will be achieved in this field. Disarmament measures must make it possible to release -additional resources for development and thus contribute to the settlement of urgent international economic problems, which, in turn, would enhance the prosperity and welfare of mankind as a whole.
The solution of the world economic problems and conflicts that are still in evidence is within our reach to solve them, it is sufficient to respect the purposes and principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter, to resort to the means of settlement it sets forth. The progress made along these lines has been great, but it must be consolidated. The peoples of the world aspire to peace, and peace is inseparable from development. The main responsibility in this area lies with the United Nations, which was set up to preserve international peace and security and to resolve international problems of an economic and social nature. But to truly carry out this noble mission, the United Nations needs the confidence of all its members. The increased interest in it that has been demonstrated recently bodes well for the future.
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has always been faithful to the ideals of the United Nations Charter and is convinced that the only way to meet the world challenges we ate facing today is to uphold the noble and humanitarian principles of the Charter of our Organization.
 
","We continue to believe that the only possible way of achieving that result is by convening forthwith an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. After the terrible suffering endured during a lengthy, bitter and pitiless war for national liberation, signs of a final settlement are beginning to emerge as a reward for the Namibian people, who sacrificed life and property in their struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). It expresses its hope that direct negotiations will take place between the two parties, with no pre-conditions whatsoever, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General in order to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace that will restore stability to the region and enable the two peoples to devote their energies and resources to their own development efforts.

44,1989,SWZ,"ï»¿
 May I start, Mr. President, by congratulating you most sincerely on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this, the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that, with your outstanding diplomatic skills, proved experience and undoubted leadership abilities, the Assembly will meet the challenge of its global commitments. On a personal note, we Swazis are delighted that this vitally important job is in the hands of a fellow African, with whose country we have enjoyed excellent, long-standing relations.
I wish also to register my appreciation for all that your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, managed to achieve, while so ably guiding the proceedings of last year's session.
You will be aware that this is my first opportunity to address the General assembly. No other Swazi King has had such an opportunity. I am very conscious, as I stand before you, of the 44 years of illustrious history belonging to fee United Nations. It is a history which has shown, time and again, that the Organization remains the most important multilateral institution for resolving international conflicts. I, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, and the whole Swazi nation are proud to be identified wife such a history, and I can assure you of my determination to lend Swaziland's full support to the Organization's fundamental principles and guiding tenets. The promotion of international peace and security, through full respect for human rights and the dignity of all citizens, remains elemental to our goals and purposes. I therefore note with relief and satisfaction feat we meet against a backdrop of a relaxation in the relations between the two super-Powers. I applaud fee role played by fee United Nations, in this, and in all its efforts in multilateral diplomacy.
Wife that in mind I should like at this point to pay tribute to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The international community without question benefits from his outstanding devotion to duty and his boundless energy. His staff too deserve our gratitude. The specialized agencies, and particularly the United Nations peace-keeping forces throughout the world, continue to earn our gratitude and appreciation foe work well done in their mission for advancing the cause of human dignity and justice.
I must express Swaziland's concern at renewed evidence of fee economic imbalance between North and South. The latest offering of the world Economic Survey of 1989 holds out very little hope to us in fee South of any improvement. As a result, Swaziland is an active member of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) and fee preferential trade area. It is our aim to counter the imbalance by encouraging our economic community in eastern and southern Africa. Swaziland is a small, landlocked Kingdom. Our economic development depends on a healthy climate of international trade relations. An active regional economic community will provide essential markets and this, in turn, will encourage our producers to diversify and thus strengthen our agro-industrial base. I would welcome endorsement of this policy by our economic partners in development.
I should like to turn my attention now to areas of conflict current in the world today.
The problems in the Middle East continue to cause concern to the people of Swaziland. We sympathize with all involved and would appeal to all parties to exercise maximum restraint. We welcome the call for an international peace conference on the Middle East. We feel that participation should be on an equal footing, with no pre-conditions.
Close to home, I should like to reassert Swaziland's unswerving commitment to the principles of non-racial democracy, non-alignment and complete respect for human dignity, justice and peaceful coexistence with all.
We hope that the South African Government, under its new leadership, will respect the views and rightful expectations of all its citizens. We are encouraged by the new initiatives and can only hope that words are backed up by action.
This time next month Namibia will have elected its first democratic Government. My country prays for a peaceful election process, free from outside pressure, whatever the outcome, we trust that the monitoring force of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) will ensure that it is the will of the majority that prevails. We look forward to welcoming Namibia to next year's Assembly session.
En route to New York I paid a short visit to our neighbour Mozambique. During friendly and fruitful discussions I assured the President of my resolve to speak out clearly on his country's behalf. The continuing war affects Swaziland in many ways. The refugees fleeing the conflict are of particular concern to us, constituting at least 7 per cent of our total population. Fifty thousand refugees currently stretch our resources in land, finance and employment. While we are encouraged by the response of the international community as a whole, and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in particular, we feel that the time has now come for the Assembly to give full attention to supporting the process started by President Chissano and carried on by Presidents Moi and Mugabe of Kenya and Zimbabwe, respectively. Let us give real assistance to the people of Mozambique and ease the alarming pattern of emigration, which is threatening to choke the countries playing reluctant host.
Sadly, many other situations of conflict persist throughout the world. Swaziland would welcome the guidance of the Secretary-General and United Nations agencies for their future settlement. I refer to the ongoing situations in Afghanistan, Iran-Iraq, Kampuchea, the Korean peninsula, Western Sahara, New Caledonia, Cyprus, Latin America and Senegal-Mauritania. Our previous successes should spur us on to address today's problems.
Swaziland was saddened to hear of events in Beijing earlier this year. We hope and pray that peace has returned to that city and that the spirit of youthful expression has not been entirely squashed.
It is heartening to be able to share in the enthusiasm of the United Nations for environmental issues. I am impressed by the deep concern of several Member States, which are working within the United Nations system on this agenda. Swaziland is fully prepared to play its part in this vital programme of action. Issues such as deforestation and desertification have particular relevance for us. We support fully all proposals made by the Assembly for an international conference in 1992, to focus on environmental awareness.
In conclusion, I should like to express my firm opinion that the United Nations continues to be the best hope for mankind. We the people of Swaziland are proud to be associated with this august Assembly. Our own policies are dictated by the realities of our situation, and cautious wisdom has always been the Swazi watchword. The Charter of the United Nations is one with which we identify most strongly. It is my privilege, then, on behalf of all the Swazi people, to pledge our continued co-operation with the United Nations system and its specialized agencies. God bless you all. 

","I, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, and the whole Swazi nation are proud to be identified wife such a history, and I can assure you of my determination to lend Swaziland's full support to the Organization's fundamental principles and guiding tenets.

44,1989,DNK,"ï»¿
 I congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.  Your wide experience and diplomatic skills will no doubt be very valuable to us in our efforts to attain fruitful results in this session. The world today is a better place than it was last year, and it is changing rapidly. New challenges seem to emerge every day: old ones acquire new dimensions. Some conflicts continue to fester; but others, fortunately, are on the brink of peaceful solution.
So, on balance, we can look to the future with optimism but not with complacency. Much remains to be done, and we are increasingly looking to the UN for assistance. It is against this background that he general assembly will have to address a number of international issues, including regional conflicts still in need of solution, the environmental challenge, the promotion of human rights, the debts problem, drugs and terrorism. 
 Speaking here I am particularly happy to note that the positive trend towards multilateralism continues. A growing number of member states avail themselves of the UN machinery in trying to solve regional and international conflicts. In Southern Africa the UN is playing a crucial role in Namibia's long overdue transition to independence. In Central America the UN is assuming ever more tasks. In other areas of conflict, such as Cyprus, Iraq-Iran and Western Sahara, the UN continues its steady efforts towards peaceful solutions. 
We welcome the fact that more and more Member States realize the urgent need to make it possible for the Organization to fulfil the role originally foreseen in the Charter by its founders.
Full respect for the principle of universality is one important prerequisite, if the United Nations is fully to play this role. But it is also important to improve the practical application of the United Nations machinery, especially to make better use of the peace-keeping operations.
Denmark remains a staunch supporter of the United Nations peace-keeping operations, as evidenced by our participation in most of them. Most recently Denmark placed a contingent at the disposal of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia (UNTAG).
It is regrettable that the problems affecting the financing of peace-keeping activities - most notably the United Nations forces in Cyprus and Lebanon â have not been solved. Member States must recognize their collective responsibility for the financing of this essential work and demonstrate political will to meet their obligations.
United Nations peace-keeping operations should be carried out effectively and with flexibility. They must be of a temporary nature and they must support political efforts aimed at achieving a final peaceful solution to the conflict in question. They must not become guardians of an unacceptable political status quo.
Denmark will evaluate its contributions - present and future - to the peace-keeping operations on the basis of these factors: financing and effectiveness.
But a solution must also be found to the financial problems of the United Nations in general. The United Nations can play a strong and effective role in meeting the global challenges of the 1990s only if the financial problems of the Organization are solved, it is encouraging that the financial situation has improved this year. But a durable solution requires that all Member states pay promptly and in full.
With regard to the international situation much has been achieved in the relations between East and West over the past few years. We have seen a continuation of high-level meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union and a general intensification of the dialogue over the East-West divide.  
More important, this positive develop seems to be acquiring a momentum of its own. I hope and trust that after having taken the most difficult first steps, we can now reach out for still more. We attentively follow the encouraging endeavours for change in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary, The reforms under way in these countries increase Prospects of intensified international collaboration in all spheres: in multilateral forums as well as in bilateral contacts.
Denmark whole-heartedly welcomes this development. We are prepared to take on our share, nationally as well as in cooperation with other Western countries, to support and further encourage the reform process. We will do this through an intensified political dialogue and through a significant expansion of economic and commercial co-operation. We are faced with an historic development. We must all seize the opportunity to help bring about positive change, both for individual citizens and for the general situation in Europe in this context I wish to highlight one particular event: the successful conclusion of the follow-up feting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna. Its concluding document provides a basis for important steps forward within all the areas covered. One of the most important results of the Vienna meeting is the prominent position now occupied by the human dimension in the CSCE process.
I am convinced that the decision to convene a conference on this important aspect will prove to be a wise one. The Conference had a promising start in Paris this summer; and I very much hope that the meeting in Copenhagen next year will result in further progress to the benefit of East-West relations.
Recent developments in the arms control and disarmament field have also been quite promising, prospects for real breakthroughs seem brighter now than ever before. The negotiations on conventional forces in Vienna came off to a good start. Although we do not underestimate the problems still ahead, we remain optimistic that an agreement on conventional armed forces in Europe can be worked out in the near future. 
Disarmament, however, is not the prerogative of the super-Powers - or of the European countries. Disarmament and the building of greater confidence and security is needed in all parts of the world. All Member States bear a responsibility. The United Nations can play a very important role in promoting disarmament world wide. However, if we wish the Organization to fulfil its role. Member States must act accordingly.
Next year the Fourth Review Conference on the non-proliferation Treaty (NOT) will take place. The existence of a strong non-proliferation system has contributed to maintaining international peace and security during the last 20 years. This has been to the benefit of all countries - including those which have not yet signed the NOT. And the time has come for those countries, to acknowledge their responsibility and to join the Treaty.

Negotiations over the last years on chemical weapons give rise to the hope that an agreement on a global ban can soon be concluded. All parties must participate whole-heartedly and constructively in these negotiations. We must not get lost in technical details but continue to keep the political goal of a global ban before us.
And now, let me turn just briefly to some of the regional conflicts, in the Middle East the more constructive policy of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO) presented at last year's session of the General Assembly has brought new momentum to the peace process.
However, the prevailing atmosphere of violence and the devastating mutual mistrust still represent serious obstacles to the establishment of security for all States and justice for all peoples in the area. The tragic situation in the occupied territories clearly demonstrates the need for all parties to exercise the utmost restraint. Confidence-building may be a slow and sometimes painful process requiring intensive efforts and courage, but it is necessary.
Concrete steps must also be taken to get the peace process off the ground. The suggestion to hold elections in the territories occupied by Israel could bring the peace process forward if the elections are conducted under circumstances and guarantees acceptable to the Palestinians. The repressive measures taken by the occupying authorities in violation of international law must cease. Not only would such a step alleviate a serious humanitarian problem, it would also serve to reduce the atmosphere of mistrust. 
The tragic situation in Lebanon has recently deteriorated beyond the most Pessimistic predictions, it is our common responsibility to do our utmost to contribute to securing the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon. But the most urgent task is to ensure a stable and lasting cessation of hostilities and to attend to the basic needs of the Lebanese people on humanitarian grounds and impartially. We applaud and support the efforts of the Arab League to this end.
Denmark deeply regrets that the international conference on Cambodia, in Paris, did not succeed in reaching an agreement on a lasting solution. We hope that all parties will show restraint, and we urge that all avenues be utilized to allow the people of Cambodia to exercise their right to self-determination and also to re-establish Cambodia as an independent, sovereign, neutral and non-aligned State.
In southern Africa we have been greatly encouraged by the progress towards independence in Namibia through democratic and free elections. THIS historical development is not least a result of the tenacious AND dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative as well as the presence of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia.
It is the firm hope of the Danish Government that the elections will lead to the formation of democratic institutions in Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We look forward to welcoming a free and independent Namibia as a member of the international community next year. In sharp contrast to the developments in Namibia, the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa has continued without significant changes. Many South Africans are still imprisoned for their political beliefs and activities. The state of emergency has this summer, once again, been prolonged. And the South African regime continues its flagrant violations of fundamental human rights. There is now - maybe more than ever - a crucial need for a national dialogue between all groups in South Africa.
After the elections on 6 September we look to the new President to implement the urgently needed fundamental changes. Apartheid must be dismantled. We urge the new President to show wisdom and courage and to realize that nothing short of the total abolition of apartheid will meet the aspirations of the black majority. Until this goal has been reached the world community must continue to apply pressure, including economic sanctions, on the South African Government.
One of the most urgent challenges facing mankind today is probably the global environmental problems. A proper response to the environmental challenges is of Paramount importance for development and for the survival of humanity. Our planet should not be regarded as an inheritance from past generations, but rather as a treasure held in trust for future generations.
Scientists have clearly and convincingly demonstrated the threats to our environment posed by the depletion of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and other forms of environmental degradation, including deforestation and desertification. 
The world economic summit in July 1989 called for a determined and concerted international response to the environmental challenge. And for the early adoption world-wide of policies based on sustainable development. It was furthermore stated that environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade, development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning. Environmental issues will become an integral part of the economic decision-making process both at national and at international levels.

Many of the processes already under way will be integrated in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. It is imperative that the Conference both define the sources of environmental degradation and underdevelopment and agree on concrete actions to deal with the major environmental issues.
Participating Governments must make political commitments to act individually and together to restore the global environment. The transfer of appropriate technology and additional financial resources to the poorer developing countries will be essential if those countries are to participate actively in this global effort.
As a follow-up to the recommendations in the Environmental Perspective and in the Brundtland report, Denmark has adopted a comprehensive national action plan and a specific action plan for development co-operation.
In meeting the environment challenge we must not lose sight of other basic problems facing the developing countries in particular. The debt problem is among the most prominent. During the past year new steps have been taken to deal with that issue. the IMF and the WB have approved support for the reduction of private debt and service of highly indebted middle-income countries. These decisions constitute an important development. 
The success of the arrangements depends to a large extent on the willingness of commercial banks to agree to significant debt reduction and, in many cases to provide new money as well. This would be in their own interest as well as in the interest of the indebted developing countries. It is recognised that severely indebted low-income countries need concessional debt relief. We welcome the implementation of the Paris Club concessional rescheduling terms agree at the Toronto summit.  
We also welcome the decision of several creditor countries, including two of the largest ones, to waive the official debt of low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, we note with satisfaction the decision of the WB to allocate $US 100 million of its net income to the support of debt reduction efforts in countries that receive only international development assistance. 
Solving the debt problem is important, but more aid of good quality is very much needed as well. Denmark, together with the other Nordic countries, has recently urged all donor countries to take certain concrete steps to achieve as soon as possible the United Nations objective of .7 per cent, an objective Denmark has already met, seven years ago, as we expect to reach the 1 per cent goal in 1992.
Promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination continues to be one of the basic obligations of the United Nations. Over the years the United Nations has developed a considerable number of conventions on human rights. Our main task today is to ensure their full implementation. All countries are unconditionally obliged to respect human rights in accordance with the Charter and the conventions to which they have freely acceded. Human rights are by nature universal. They should not be given different meanings or interpretations in various regions of the world. The global society has the right - even the duty - to see the individual and respect for his rights as a relevant concern.
Human rights take a natural and central place also in development co-operation. Each individual's possibilities of influencing his or her own situation have to be taken into account. Only then can we expect a development process to become truly sustainable - and humane. 
My Government sincerely believes that promotion of the democratisation process should become fully integrated into the development strategies of the coming years. I trust that international agencies for development assistance will also give due consideration to human rights issues. During this year we have witnessed a serious escalation in the illicit drug traffic. Still-more-sophisticated methods are being employed by the drug merchants, leaving States and the international community with no alternative but to combat this evil. The machinery is at hand to attack this global problem. The international community's response should be firm and coordinated, leaving our adversaries in no doubt that they will be apprehended, prosecuted and punished and, if necessary, extradited to a State where prosecution will take place. There must be no safe haven for drug terrorists. Every few months the world community continues to receive reports about new terrorist incidents. My Government urges the Assembly to stand united in its condemnation of these criminal acts wherever and by whomever committed and to encourage intensified international cooperation at all levels in this field.
It is not always easy to recognize the importance of international events as they unfold. Many factors are at play and the outcome of their interaction is often only appreciated years later. By now I think many would agree that we are entering a new era in international politics. People in many regions of the world are becoming more aware of their democratic rights. And many Governments are introducing domestic reforms to meet popular demand. Governments and individuals are becoming increasingly aware of the interdependence of the community of nations and hence of the need to find common solutions to our common global problems.
I am not saying that the future is without dangers. Regional conflicts - such as those in the Middle East and southern Africa - pose a threat not only to the peoples of those regions but to us all. But the general trend of positive change must be seized to tackle the problems before us. We must intensify our efforts to solve the various serious regional conflicts. We must encourage the trend towards democracy in many parts of the world and undertake all possible endeavours to promote and protect human rights. We must spare no effort to solve the economic Problems of the developing countries. We must pool our resources to eliminate poverty and illiteracy. We must accelerate the process of disarmament, not only in Europe but in all parts of the world. We must fight the scourges of terrorism and narcotic drugs. We must act swiftly - before it is too late - to save our environment for future generations. We must do all this - and much more.
When I consider the many positive developments since I spoke from this rostrum a year ago, I am optimistic about our possibilities for progress. But we must act together  and act now.
","It is against this background that he general assembly will have to address a number of international issues, including regional conflicts still in need of solution, the environmental challenge, the promotion of human rights, the debts problem, drugs and terrorism. We attentively follow the encouraging endeavours for change in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary, The reforms under way in these countries increase Prospects of intensified international collaboration in all spheres: in multilateral forums as well as in bilateral contacts. Although we do not underestimate the problems still ahead, we remain optimistic that an agreement on conventional armed forces in Europe can be worked out in the near future. The international community's response should be firm and coordinated, leaving our adversaries in no doubt that they will be apprehended, prosecuted and punished and, if necessary, extradited to a State where prosecution will take place. Governments and individuals are becoming increasingly aware of the interdependence of the community of nations and hence of the need to find common solutions to our common global problems."
44,1989,DOM,"ï»¿
It is a great honour and pleasure for me to return to this rostrum for the forty-fourth session of the Assembly and to address it on behalf of my country, the Dominican Republic.
It is also a matter of great satisfaction to me to convey to Mr. Joseph Nanven Garba the warm congratulations of the Dominican Government, and of our delegation in particular, on his well-deserved election to the presidency of this great gathering. I look forward confidently to his complete success in this sensitive undertaking inasmuch as he is a skilled and seasoned diplomat from a region which is undergoing a steady process of growth and development - a fact that can be observed in the importance and the scope of the Convention concluded between the European Economic Community and the African, Caribbean aid Pacific States, better known as the lome Convention, the progress of which we have been following in our country with much interest and with a great feeling of solidarity. His outstanding personal qualities will ensure that the work and the deliberations of this session will be guided with due deliberation and the highest aims. In this respect, he can count on our resolute co-operation.
This is a suitable opportunity to express our high esteem for that outstanding Argentine internationalist, Mr, Dante Caputo, for his exemplary guidance of the work of the last session.
On this solemn occasion we should like to place on record our great appreciation and admiration for the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the valuable, timely and unstinting work that he has been doing to promote peace and understanding among the peoples and nations of the Earth.
At the beginning of my statement I should like to thank the representatives for their attention to lay sincere message of goodwill from a part of the globe that has been called upon to play a major role from the time of the arrival in the New World of the visionary, the admiral of the seas Christopher Columbus, a portentous event that changed the course of history.
Hispaniola has had the honour of having its capital Santo Domingo, as the headquarters of the first administrative, religious, cultural, scientific and economic institutions of the American continent.
Fran this confluence of cultures, ethnic groups, customs and traditions on Hispaniola, the first voices were raised in defence of the indigenous races, which formed a new and juridical concept of equality and justice among human beings, through jus gentium, the law of nations, in which one can find the true roots of modern international law, and as a result, the distant origins of the international bodies designed to ensure the observance and effectiveness of the inherent rights of the human person.
Under that auspicious beacon, in this lofty body in which all the nations of the world are represented with their own particular characteristics, we are again meeting in a yearly pilgrimage to find peace. But this ideal, which is so difficult to express in specific terms, cannot be fully achieved unless it is by means of open and respectful, but firm and conclusive, dialogue, with a view to putting an end to terrorism and drug trafficking, in whatever form or under any pretext.
It is natural that any undertaking directed towards limiting the arms race and eliminating deadly weapons should be seen as a comforting and encouraging example. That is the case with respect to the agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was jointly announced by Secretary of State James Baker and Minister for Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze. Special mention should be made of the plan proposed at this session of the General Assembly by the President of the United States, Mr. George Bush, to rid the Earth of the scourge of chemical weapons, a proposal that was welcomed by the Soviet Union. These positive steps, which demonstrate the will of both super-Powers to reduce the causes of tension and disagreement, will have a favourable impact on world politics in the coming years.
Once again, I should like to recall that the Dominican Republic, a Caribbean nation, is aware that its development is indissolubly linked to that of our neighbour, Haiti, and of the other countries of the area. Our trade with those countries had been minimal despite the geographic,-, ethnic, historic and economic bonds that unite us. Hence our Government has begun an energetic movement towards integration with our Caribbean brothers, since we are fully convinced that it is only by means of joint, united efforts that we shall achieve the goals that will bring us full development for our peoples.
With regard to the tragic situation in Central America, our country reiterates that it is interested in co-operating in the search for a speedy and most fitting solution of this conflict. We categorically support the agreements that have been entered into in the search for peace by the five Central American Presidents â the Esquipulas II Agreements and the Playa del Tesoro Declarations - aimed at achieving a peaceful negotiated solution to the Central American crisis. The recent Tela presidential summit demonstrates that there is hope that peace can be achieved, for peace is the essential prerequisite for the solution of the political, economic and social problems of the region.
The Dominican Republic has noted with particular interest the events occurring throughout Africa, not only because of its impact on international policies, but also because the African race is part of our own ethnic and cultural substratum. We stand in solidarity with the African peoples and participate in efforts to solve their problems, which are similar to those facing all developing countries. The situation in southern Africa continues to be explosive, with unforeseeable consequences for peace and security in the area; its prolongation has an impact on international stability.
Security Council resolution 435 (1978) contains the basic elements for a just and lasting solution of the question of Namibia. For almost 20 years the South African apartheid regime has been illegally occupying the Territory, in defiance of all the relevant United Nations resolutions. We defend Namibia's fundamental right to self-determination. The delegation of the Dominican Republic believes that the system of government in South African breeds violence, injustice, oppression, inequality and discrimination - in other words, everything that flies in the face of the ideals behind the founding of the United Nations. The eradication of apartheid and independence for Namibia will create the necessary conditions for a return to peace in southern Africa. 
We call for the cessation of the growing hostilities between Syrian forces and Lebanese Christian soldiers. Despite this escalation, the efforts for peace that have begun recently give us hope for a definitive solution of the conflict.
The situation in the Middle East, which is of great concern to all nations of the world, has a direct impact on Dominicans, because among our ethnic groups there are many people with Palestinian, Syrian, Arab and Israeli roots, with the resultant influence they bring to our national life.
The Dominican Republic has been concerned for several years about the situation in the Korean peninsula. Our country has supported the view that Korean affairs must be solved peacefully by means of dialogue between the two Koreas. The Republic of Korea must be admitted to membership in the United Nations in keeping with the principle of universality. Its entry into the Organization would contribute to reducing tension and promoting peace in north-eastern Asia. The Dominican Republic has viewed favourably the formula for the unification of the Korean community that was proposed recently by the Government of the Republic of Korea to promote peaceful coexistence between the south and the north of Korea.
The serious and tragic situation in many developing nations makes it imperative for us urgently to adopt effective and concrete measures to improve the living conditions of millions in the third world. The presence in this important gathering of a growing number of Heads of State or Government from those countries is clear proof of the world-wide interest and expectations regarding the results and conclusions of this session, which has also brought together representatives of the most powerful and developed countries of the world.
The situation of the nations of the third world is so critical and paradoxical that their economies are constantly stagnating or actually deteriorating. There will be no improvement until more favourable conditions are provided for access by our export products to the developed countries' markets. If that goal is achieved, and if the developing countries receive better treatment in negotiations regarding their external debt from the creditor nations and entities, we shall have an opportunity, with the impetus of this necessary co-operation, to embark energetically and optimistically upon the path of our development.
Thus, it is obvious that the solution to the general problem of the external debt cannot be achieved with the ways and means that have been used to date, since in most cases they do not allow for economic growth and therefore subject peoples to impoverishment and social upheaval.
The international community, aware of the intricate nature of this problem, which is not merely economic in nature, recognizes that the United Nations has the competence to seek a solution in the political sphere.
The position of the Dominican Republic was defined graphically by His Excellency Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, the President of the Dominican Republic, in his speech at the opening meeting of the Twelfth Annual Conference on Investment, Trade and Development, held in Miami, in the United States, in November of 1988. He said: 'The goal set forth in Berlin for the third-world countries is not to pay the public debt but, above all, to achieve sustained economic growth and an increase in per-capita income that will guarantee our dispossessed masses the right to eat, to clothe themselves, to educate their children and to live under a decent roof. In other words, the third-world countries face two challenges - not one, as was said in Berlin. The first is to live; the second, to pay'.
Since terrorism continues to affect all nations to such a degree and with such tragic and disastrous consequences, sowing fear and insecurity, a strong, internationally co-ordinated plan must be adopted to combat it more firmly and thereby ensure its eradication. One of the most criminal and frequent forms of terrorist action is the attacks against passengers, flights and airports. Such attacks are increasingly stirring the universal conscience.
The Dominican Republic strongly condemns the subversive activities of international terrorism, which is carried out indiscriminately against mothers, innocent children and the ill - in other words, against life itself, the most precious thing we own.
The alarming problem of drugs has reached such dimensions, it terms both of production and of trade and consumption, that our delegation wishes to place it on record that the Dominican Government is struggling with all the means in its power to deal with this social evil that is spreading like a flood. For that purpose our courts have been imposing increasingly severe sentences on drug traffickers. Publicity has been given to this throughout the country with a view to ensuring that drug users and traffickers are aware of it and that people understand the evil and disastrous consequences of this illegal trade.
We also give our moral support to the battle which is being waged by countries throughout the continent and whose development we are following with great interest.
At this difficult historical time of conflict, with acute, burning problems that I have mentioned in this statement - to which my colleagues in the Assembly have been good enough to listen with attention - there have been signs of detente and an improvement in international relations above and beyond diverse criticism or positions. I should like to express on behalf of the Government that I have the honour of representing and on my own behalf, our fervent desire to see concrete form given to the ideals and principles that led to the establishment of the world Organization, in which mankind has placed its hopes for a better future in which the ethical and spiritual values that underlie our civilization prevail.
","I look forward confidently to his complete success in this sensitive undertaking inasmuch as he is a skilled and seasoned diplomat from a region which is undergoing a steady process of growth and development - a fact that can be observed in the importance and the scope of the Convention concluded between the European Economic Community and the African, Caribbean aid Pacific States, better known as the lome Convention, the progress of which we have been following in our country with much interest and with a great feeling of solidarity.

44,1989,MDG,"ï»¿At the behest of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar I wish to convey to
Major-General Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. We have long known his merits and qualities and we trust that in the coming months he will continue to place at the service of the international community the devotion he has demonstrated in the defence of African dignity. His predecessor, Mr, Dante Caputo, guided the work of the forty-third session in an outstanding manner. We appreciated his statesmanlike qualities and his courteous efficiency, and we thank him.
Reading the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization reinforced our view that no area of international activity is beyond his ken or sphere of legitimate interest. We were particularly struck by the coherence and lucidity of his description of activities aimed at keeping the peace, preventing conflicts, reducing the threat of war and promoting the settlement of disputes. We assure the Secretary-General of the continued co-operation of the Government of Madagascar in that sphere as in others, and convey to him our best wishes for the successful discharge of his mandate.
During this debate the international situation has been analysed thoroughly and in detail, but often in a subjective manner, with events being interpreted from the standpoint of relations between North and South or East and west; it is true that we have not yet been able to rid ourselves of our preconceptions. Granted, there is less recrimination, more openness and a larger number of appeals to common sense and to the need to allay tensions. But at the same time everyone stands ready to defend new positions at a time when the predictable reactions of the cold-war era are no longer a decisive element in the formulation of national policy.
We still seek a world free from day-to-day insecurity, a more democratic world, a world where national selfishness has given way to the common interest, a world unequivocally devoted to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Cynics would say we have been trying to do this without too many results for the past 44 years and that we are condemned to instability, because balance - even the balance we are welcoming today - is always precarious.
But let us begin to build with what we have and with what we are promised. To be sure, nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament are far away, on a distant horizon. But it would be crass to disregard the fact that realignment of the mutual interests of the great Powers and the two principal military blocs and a certain flexibility in stated pre-conditions have permitted the dialogue on arms control to resume.
By the summer of 1990 there will be a treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons, to be followed probably by an agreement on naval nuclear weapons. There has been progress on conventional weapons. Chemical weapons have been the subject of more or less similar proposals by the two super-Powers. Compromise has been reached on verification of underground nuclear tests.. The 1972 Treaty on anti-ballistic missiles is being respected. Finally, to give longer-term perspective to current initiatives, we expect the convening in 1990 of a United Nations conference on the conversion of military industries to civilian use.
The list is not as complete as we might have wished, it omits at least two points. Could it be some remaining yearning for rivalry and confrontation between the great Powers that has suppressed mention of zones of peace and co-operation, including that of the Indian Ocean, and of nuclear-weapon-free zones? What role is to be assigned to the United Nations in the multilateral verification of disarmament agreements? It is good to show that we have been moving in the right direction for several years, but it would be even better to take measures to consolidate the international community's confidence in the United Nations in all spheres of international relations.
when we mention the United Nations we naturally think of the Secretary-General, of the principal organs, and thus the decision-making procedures. But the most important decisions - relating to aggression, the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security, the settlement of disputes, the International Trusteeship System, and arms control and eventual disarmament - are by statute taken by the Security Council.
We want to strengthen the Council's role in the areas of timeliness, effectiveness, credibility and democracy. It is therefore time to review Article 27 of the Charter, in particular its paragraph 3. The veto power, as it is commonly known, has often paralysed the Security Council more than one might have reasonably expected. At a time when the rule of consensus is largely accepted, we should consider either eliminating the clause requiring unanimity among the permanent members or extending it to all members. Coexistence of consensus and the veto is intolerable unless certain members view consensus as the ability to cast a double veto.
After that digression - which was not really a digression at all - we wonder, despite our commitment to detente and co-operation, whether the present improvement in the political climate applies everywhere and whether it can survive the test of time and events. We have been disappointed too often in the past, and our experience with volte-faces, unhealthy obstinacy and bad faith on the part of some of our interlocutors hardly justifies excessive, soothing optimism.
In southern Africa there is talk of a new constitutional order, fundamental change, dialogue and power-sharing by the year 2000. The gradualists ask us to view this supposed turnaround as auguring the coming of democracy to South Africa. But we see only slogans intended to buy time, offset the negative impact of sanctions and maintain segregation and white supremacy in a country that has been distorted by the persistence of the monstrosities known as Bantustans.
We see the problem in two parts: full recognition of black nationalism as the factor that will determine the political, economic and social future of South Africa; and, as a corollary, equal and full enjoyment of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights by the black majority. Until there is agreement on those two points, and they are translated into reality, everything will remain at the level of good intentions. It is very easy to deny those good intentions by making exceptions of special and emergency situations, and then we can do nothing to put an end to the cycle of cynicism, bitterness, impatience and violence - violent carried out for the sake of freedom, and therefore justified.
In the same region, the plan resulting from Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is being applied as best it can in Namibia. The operation is difficult and complex. The casual arrogance of the South African representatives can upset the African nations and put South Africa's impartiality in doubt. We still have the impression that the elections will be just one more opportunity to use manoeuvres and manipulations to frustrate the true aspirations of the Namibian people. Next month will be decisive. I would simply repeat Comrade Sam Nujoma's reference to 'freedom and independence for Namibia in order to permit the advent of peace and, if that is the wish of the minority, national reconciliation'. Our position on Western Sahara has not fundamentally changed. Thanks to the joint efforts of the organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the situation has evolved, despite some differences of view. The most important thing at this point is to find a political solution, beginning with direct dialogue between the two parties, within the framework of the agreement in principle of 30 August 1988 between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.
In the Near and the Middle East, in southern and South-East Asia and in Latin America we see particularly disturbing developments. Hardly is a step taken towards a comprehensive and acceptable solution than difficulties appear. They are difficulties inherent in the nature of conflicts and disputes, but they have been put aside for the sake of convenience or because of an excess of optimism. The international community can see here a veritable Penelope's shroud. We are almost powerless as we witness the continuation or the beginning of civil wars, with their train of devastation and refugees and the introduction of distrust, which has become a permanent feature of international relations.
How much longer must we wait for the installation of Governments of national reconciliation in Afghanistan and Cambodia? How do we stand with regard to the independent reunification, without outside interference, of the Korean peninsula? When will a just and lasting peace be established between Iran and Iraq? Why Prolong the suffering of Lebanon and tolerate the total stagnation on the question of the Middle East? Ho, can we alia, the Palestinians, whose national rights are internationally recognized, to continue to be the pawn in shameful dealings that create so much suffering? What is the reason for the lack of Progress in the inter-communal talks in Cyprus? Finally, why must the countries of Central America be constantly frustrated in their search for peace, co-operation and reconciliation through dialogue?
The settlement of regional conflicts is on the agenda of the regular exchanges of view between the two super-Powers, it should be an integral part of the historic renewal in international relations, but so far it has been regarded as a matter of secondary importance. From time to time some results of diplomacy are brought out into the open, but discreet or secret diplomacy requires that the rest be dealt with behind the scenes. But the situations, the claims and the stakes are well known; we all advocate the same principles and we have together defined the framework for a settlement, here at the United Nations. Therefore, we are all involved in a common undertaking, which cannot be the monopoly of any one party. It is true that on several occasions we have asked the major Powers to use their influence, but that cannot be regarded as a transfer of competence to them alone. We are asking for a little more transparency so that, following the principle of shared security, we may exercise our responsibilities in full knowledge of the situation.
My comments apply equally to the economic area. Until there is equal and guaranteed security for all we cannot speak about viable, durable, acceptable or sustainable development. The use from one decade to another oÂ£ various adjectives shows that we are still seeking a development model which takes account of the interests of the whole community. The reports of international institutions would lead one to believe that, at least in its global aspects, the crisis is drawing to an end. Statistics may support the advocates of theoretical interdependence, but the reality is different.
The nature of the complaints of the developing countries has not changed. We continue to suffer from a system that has lasted too long, from structures that are inadequate, if not anachronistic, and from one-sided rules of the game. That is true of the fixing of prices for our products, the need to go through certain channels, the organization of international trade, the monetary and financial system and access to technology. 
We are again speaking of the new international economic order, which means the initiation of global negotiations in the framework of the North-South dialogue to remedy the situation I have described, which has become increasingly intolerable. But the answer is always the same. On the one hand, there is recognition of the need for an interdependent world, the internationalisation of problem-solving and the overlapping nature of the solutions to problems. On the other hand, because of the principle of decentralization Of decision-making, there is insistence that specific points must be discussed within separate institutions and agencies. He hope that the impasse thus created will be ended by the convening in April 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and in particular the revival of economic growth and the development, of the developing countries.
In the mean time, as the North-South dialogue will not, as far as we can see, resume soon, we must organize ourselves better in order to take effective control of the authentic path for our own development, and we must revitalize South-South co-operation. He have sometimes thought it sufficient to criticize ourselves, as if our failure resulted more from our hesitation to take decisive collective action in key areas, such as raw materials, monetary questions and the financing of development.
Ten years ago, at the sixth summit conference of the non-aligned countries, Madagascar suggested the creation of a stabilization fund, a monetary fund and a development fund for the non-aligned countries and other developing countries. The international environment has changed since then, but our objectives are still the same: to achieve co-ordination on problems of international liquidity; to rebalance international trade, introducing equity and justice; to increase export earnings; and to recycle available resources for development purposes. The establishment of those three funds would be a good thing, bat it would be difficult. Vet we believe more than ever before that an integrated approach to development at the level of analysis and at the level of actual operations and functioning remains essential it we wish to rebuild the world economy on a firm basis of solidarity and mutual trust.
These few ideas I have expressed on development and on the reluctance, if not the passivity, of both North and South may appear irrelevant if looked at from the standpoint of the real and immediate problems of international debt.
Let us set aside for the moment the well-known controversy over responsibility for the indebtedness, the negative effects of deflation, the postponing or reduction of the debt, the suitability of cultural adjustment programmes, the timeliness of structural adjustment programmes in the African framework, and the impact of current initiatives on political and socio-economic changes. Above and beyond different approaches to understanding and methodology, the objective is always the same, namely, how to manage the debt reasonably while maintaining sustainable development with a human face under the best possible conditions of complementarity and co-ordination.
Different approaches are suggested to the debtors. Some have proved successful in specific cases and others benefit from rational analysis at the level of programming and action. New solutions may be desirable, but they must come not from polarization of positions but from agreements between debtors and creditors. The search for such agreement may be made easier within certain forums, including the International Conference on Money and Finance for Development, a conference of debtors, the International Conference on debt and the International Conference on Africa's Eternal Indebtedness.
If we recognize that we face a long-term problem which, if not solved, may threaten economic development, the international banking system and even international peace and security, we cannot escape the conclusion that we need to tackle the problem on a multilateral, systematic basis.
There is no panacea, but there is nothing to or event our considering certain proposals, including those of Professor Robert A. Mundell, without committing ourselves to then. For example, would it be a viable proposition to combine the potential of the Bank for International Settlements with an informal agency on the model of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to be called 'general agreement on debt, adjustment and development policies'?
History shows that the problem of international debt has existed for over 2,000 years. For the developing countries, this problem is a reality to which they awoke wife some distress 10 years ago, because they had not expected to experience again the catastrophe of the 1920s and 1930s. Indebtedness is permanent in nature. Once a debt accrues the level of development of a country is always assessed in terms of its ability to increase its debt. That is the system? it is for debtors and creditors to ensure that it functions in an orderly manner taking into account foreseeable developments in the political, economic and social situation.
Something else that could change our attitude to development is the importance attached in fee last decade to fee environment and the ecosystem as a whole. The public are increasingly aware of the dangers of wastage and exhaustion of resources, pollution and harmful industrial wastes, toxic waste end dumping of such waste, biospheric disruptions, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion and degradation and fee threat of fee extinction of certain vegetable or animal species. For a long time human society, encouraged by the spectacular results of the Industrial Revolution, having accepted the myth of the conquest of new frontiers, believed that production and growth were unlimited. In fact, however, having studied our common heritage, we know its limits. The true danger now is to pursue at all costs a policy of productivity and unbridled competition. It would be irresponsible not to recognize that, in spite of all our efforts, closely interrelated crises persist: crises of development, the environment, energy, debt, population and drugs, that other scourge with disturbing political, social and economic consequences.
It was in this context that the member States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), at their special summit meeting devoted to economic question and debt, in November 1988, welcomed the conclusions of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which was presided over by Gro Harlem Brundtland. They mentioned in particular the conclusion concerning 'sustainable development', which was defined as
'development that responds to the needs of the present without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. This entire new global strategy is acceptable, but since it deals with various areas we must jointly consider the definition of priorities, rights and responsibilities, the inclusion of that concept in the present system of security and how it fits into the North-South dialogue, the unavoidable changes in methods of production and consumption, national and international commitment, the establishment of a new co-ordination institution and the future of the United Nations Environment Programme.
Before 1992, fee which an international conference on environment and development has been proposed, specific proposals could be put forward and discussed with a view to establishing international co-operation and action in the ecological sphere. As I develop my ideas in this statement I realize that the challenge of development is a difficult one but that it is our duty to accept it and succeed. Each nation or group of nations must strive to find the best means of doing so, conscious of the limitations imposed by the surrounding crisis. We have turned to our traditional partners. We have followed the suggestions of financial and monetary institutions. Now we need new concepts that can help us to emerge as quickly as possible from the present uncertain situation.
On the political level, the United Nations has made a spectacular recovery, helped by its ability to define an appropriate framework for settlement and by renewed confidence in multilateralism. On the conceptual level, there is no reason why the United Nations should not be able to achieve in development what it has achieved in peace-keeping. We agree that there should be an overall reorganization of the United Nations, not only to maintain international peace and security or facilitate the adjustment or settlement of disputes, but also, to use the words of the Charter,
'To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character'. No gratuitous challenge is being made to the existing system, although there is no unanimity on this point. Prom time to time, however, we need to take a new look at the Charter, particularly Chapters IX and X in the light of our experiences, existing situations and the expected results. It would not be wise to juggle with the role of the Economic and Social Council, with regard to co-operation for development. If one accepts the idea of the collective responsibility of Members and the ability of the United Nations to guarantee world security, one cannot disregard the economic dimension of international security.
We must pursue our argument to its logical conclusion and say that comprehensive security must be taken into account in all spheres of international activity, even though we may be accused of bringing back exclusivism and opportunism in the service of causes which are not necessarily supported by all.
","The settlement of regional conflicts is on the agenda of the regular exchanges of view between the two super-Powers, it should be an integral part of the historic renewal in international relations, but so far it has been regarded as a matter of secondary importance. The international environment has changed since then, but our objectives are still the same: to achieve co-ordination on problems of international liquidity; to rebalance international trade, introducing equity and justice; to increase export earnings; and to recycle available resources for development purposes.

44,1989,NIC,"ï»¿Let me begin by congratulating Ambassador Garba on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. I should like also to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his devoted and productive work as head of this Organization. Furthermore, I take this opportunity to express to Mr. Dante Caputo our appreciation for the work he did as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session.
To a country like Nicaragua - attacked, impoverished and drained of blood by almost a decade of illegal, unjust and immoral war - it is encouraging to hear voices of peace, democracy and detente. Let us hope that these encouraging signs will shortly be translated into reality - a reality in which peace is, as it must be, synonymous with respect for individual and collective human rights and with strict observance of the civil and political as well as the economic, social and cultural rights of individuals and peoples.
A people such as mine, which has honourably and courageously defended its dignity and has turned the hitherto abstract concepts of self-determination and sovereignty into reality, has every right to expect a better world for all. We have every right to dream and to believe that our dreams can come true  we have every right to believe and to feel that there is a dream at the root of every possibility, and a utopia at the origin of every reality. Just as regional conflicts can carry the terrifying seed of a new and final world-wide conflagration, each one of them - no matter what its causes o;Â· intentions - contains sufficient universal ingredients and elements for the whole to be seen in any one of its parts. Our times and their principal tendencies and expressions demonstrate that the centre of the world can be located anywhere.
If that is so in the case of the painful experience of war, it is equally true of other expressions, culture, art, philosophy, literature - all of which are flourishing today in places that were considered, until new, to be peripheral, and all of which have acquired undeniable universal value. It would seem - and here, inevitably, history recalls Hegel and the phenomenology of the spirit - that the universal realizes itself only in the particular.
In that sense, the world is becoming eccentric, and unity - that is, the fullest expression of the loftiest values of the spirit and of the highest human qualities - can be attained only through the co-ordination and harmonious articulation of each and every one of its component parts.
The mass media have made the world a smaller place, the universe more provincial, and the provincial more universal. No matter how far away they may occur, all developments become part of our province. At the same time, nothing that happens on our soil fails to affect the entire world community. The United Nations is at the high point of this ebb and flow of human events. That is why it is of such extraordinary importance, in this effort, to co-ordinate and harmoniously articulate the political life of our times. 
If the usefulness of the United Nations since the end of the Second World War need not be demonstrated since it is self-evident, its usefulness or rather its necessity is all the more inevitable in this contemporary world moving forward at a blinding speed, a world in which the technological revolution coexists with processes of decolonization and national liberation wars, one in which, judging by current symptoms, seems to be passing from confrontation to co-existence and, perhaps, to co-operation.
We have heard a great deal of talk, from this very rostrum, from some of the world's most important leaders about an easing of tensions and dialogue between the super-Powers, about disarmament proposals, the beginning of solutions to regional conflicts, and of the possible emergence of a multipolar world.
We naturally welcome the reshaping of international relations, but on the other hand political detente must be accompanied by economic co-operation. If that does not come about, the contradiction between North and South will sooner or later explode into conflicts not unlike current ones, or they may take on different forms.
It must also be understood that international co-operation is an objective necessity, and should not be seen as charity or a gracious concession. Planetary co-development is imperative for human survival. Development can no longer bypass, or take place at the expense of, the poor nations. Peace will never coexist with misery, injustice and exploitation.
The wretched of the Earth, as Franz Fanon so tightly called them, also inhabit out planet, and they live and dream. They are the owners of a past rich in history, culture and values, and they have every right to a future compatible with dignity. Filled with hope, we welcome the new climate of dialogue and understanding. But at the same time we must point out the gaps and loopholes whose negative significance is more qualitative than quantitative.
We believe that the moment has come to take into account each and every aspect of our complex modern world. Not to do so would be a mistake, as would interpreting the easing of tensions and the possible end of the cold war as the disappearance of all contradictions and the  td of history itself.
Consensus does not mean sanctifying a given ideology, but rather the coexistence of different forms of thought and political systems, Universality is not homogeneity  universality is unity in diversity. Those who rush to proclaim the end of ideology are in no way neutral. In fact, they ate proclaiming their own ideology in disguise. Those who explicitly or implicitly try to portray the changes taking place in today's world and the new climate of detente as the universal consecration of capitalist economics and political liberalism are committing a basic conceptual error that could lead, in short order, to misguided political practices. It would be far better to understand things as they are, objectively and without braggadocio. Pragmatism and tolerance are needed in order to accept differences and to make sure that they coexist.
In our judgement, it is imperative that those philosophical arid political premises be understood and accepted in order for there to be hope for an end to the cold war and regional conflicts, and for there to be a possibility of entering a new era of peace  development and co-operation in a world in which inevitable differences of opinion not only coexist but stimulate understanding, solidarity and justice among all the peoples of the Earth. Nicaragua, a nation of 3.5 million inhabitants located in the middle of Central America, has had close to 60,000 victims in a war of aggression that has lasted almost a decade.
Ours is a country that has endured three foreign military occupations in this century and one in the last. It has carried out a revolution whose essence and reason for being is, first and foremost, the recovery of identity and the restructuring of the nation. Against that background, and taking into account that Nicaragua is part of a region - Central America - that has been the scene of one of the most intense conflicts of our time, it is understandable that we are interested in seeing historical event interpreted fairly and precisely, even in matters seemingly of no concern to small countries, matters traditionally the exclusive province of the great Powers. That is why we demand the right to participate, from the perspective of our own conditions, as subjects and beneficiaries of contemporary history.
We believe that the attainment of full democracy continues to be the most important foundation upon which to build a more just and human world. We believe that democracy is the best system of human co-operation and the best form of social and political organization. We believe in democracy in its juridical and formal sense, in representative democracy based on universal suffrage, the rule of law and the separation of powers. But we also know that a democracy limited to normative and institutional forms is a partial and relative democracy. That is why it is necessary to round out the concept and practice of participatory democracy, in which all members of society, and not just the privileged classes, have access to the material and spiritual assets of the community. 
Moreover, taking into account the interdependence of the world in which we live, full democracy can be achieved in a country only when it is also a reality in the system of international relations. In order for full democracy to be possible it is necessary to eliminate the use of force to attack others. The principles of self-determination and sovereignty of peoples must be respected. The norms of international law must be observed, and the rulings of the International Court of Justice obeyed, so that conflicts can be resolved peacefully and peace and equilibrium reign world-wide.
Democracy is hurt by the current system of international economic relations, by unfair terms of trade, by the prices paid on world markets foe goods produced by the poor nations, by trade embargos, and other coercive economic measures used as instruments of political pressure. It is dishonest to set oneself up as an immaculate judge of the faults of others, while poor peoples are being exploited in international trade and economic relations end foreign debt and usurious interest rates choke off our peoples' possibilities of survival, depriving them of their destinies and their futures. We cannot successfully bring our struggle for democracy to an end until there is a new ethical system in the world.
For us, democracy equals human rights both individual and collective, they are a concept and a practice in which the dignity of each human being and of each people must be fully reconciled and realized. The two, necessarily, go hand in hand ; we cannot conceive of any real possibility of one existing without the other, still less of one being against the other r Nor do we accept that one can be used as a pretext for evading the other, as there is no reason of State however weighty, that can justify degrading a human being physically or morally or for not respecting his dignity and integrity. Nor is there any possible justification for attacking a people in the name of democracy and attempting to violate its sovereignty and its right to self-determination. Nor is there any justification for speculating with poverty and trafficking in necessities in the name of the free market. We do not believe in freedom founded on the oppression arid exploitation of others. We do not accept the freedom of the fox given the run of the henhouse.
Nicaragua has proposed that international agencies specializing in human rights should be made responsible for verifying that human rights are being observed in each of the countries in Central America. We believe that this approach is much more appropriate than any s el f-monitoring procedure.
Central America is still experiencing the most serious crisis in its history. The Central American crisis, which began to take shape several decades ago, has its roots in poverty, underdevelopment and exploitation, and in the fact that its peoples - like the peoples of other regions - have been relegated to the sidelines of history. The role of the region as a provider of raw materials in conditions of exploitation and destitution, as a banana plantation and a zone of strategic and geopolitical interest determined its fate for many years. The local oligarchies had on their side the military - and had the mentality and functions more of occupiers than defenders of sovereignty - and served as the tools of ruthless exploitation from abroad. Given that the contradictions are more or less marked and that the situations of each country in the region are specific and particular to them, the basis, origins and general characteristics are one and the sane. Crude and brutal military dictatorships was for decades the dominant political system in almost all the com tries in the area. Everyone is aware of the most visible and explosive stage in our history. It is unfortunate that problems only become known about when they explode.
The crisis in Central America has not been only a political and military one it was and still is an economic and social one also. For that reason, the solution should be global and should not be restricted to political bodies, which - although absolutely essential and indispensable - are not capable of dealing with the problem as a whole. This conclusion fits perfectly within the global analysis of the world situation we attempted earlier. This is why all necessary support must be given, together with the application and development of political agreements, to solve the serious economic problems and the even more serious social problems. Economic assistance for Central America must be provided immediately, without waiting for the political problem to be completely solved. Both aspects, the political and the economic, are closely and dialectically related, and must therefore must be dealt with together in the search for the necessary solution. At the political level, the progress we have made has been extremely important and provides a grounding for realistic optimism that there is a possibility that the conflict can be settled in the not-so-distant future, participation by the Latin American countries through the Contadora and Contadora Support Groups has been very important.
Action by the Central American countries was decisive at the Esquipulas meetings end very particularly so at the last two summits at Costa del Sol, in El Salvador, and at Tela, in Honduras. The commitment made by the five Central American countries to have their electoral processes verified by observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), the agreements to demobilize the counter-revolutionary forces which should be completed by December 5 this year at the latest, according to the agreed timetable - and for them to be relocated and voluntarily repatriated, end the commitment by each State not to use its territory to attack other countries undoubtedly constitute the essential points of the political accords agreed by the five Central American Presidents, and, in general terms, of the whole peace process in the region.
Nicaragua, in compliance with these agreements, has invited the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the OAS to appoint commissions to verify the whole electoral process in Nicaragua, which is to be completed on 25 February 1990. Both commissions have been carrying out their work in Nicaragua for some time now. In addition, my country has invited observers from the European Parliament and also ex-Presidents Jimmy Carter of the United States and Raul Alfonsin of Argentina. We hope that the other Central American countries, in compliance with the agreements, will invite the United Nations and the OAS to observe their electoral processes.
As my Government has sand, the transparency  d scope of the current electoral process in Nicaragua strengthens democracy in the country and contributes to the stability of the region. All countries must respect the sovereign nature of this process and desist from any policy of electoral interference or manipulation. The international community should immediately provide support for the effort required by this democratic exercise. 
In addition for the United Nations Electoral Observation Mission now functioning in Nicaragua  the United Nations is participating in the Central American peace process through the United Nations Observers in Central America, the body entrusted with verifying that irregular forces do not use cross-border operations and that the territories of Central American countries are not used to attack other nations. Then there is the International Support and Verification Commission (CIAV), which is to demobilize the counter-revolutionaries and oversee their repatriation and resettlement.
The participation of Spain, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and a Latin American country in the work of ONUCA will be an additional guarantee of compliance with the relevant part of the peace agreements. As stated in the declaration issued by the Nicaraguan Government on the occasion of the visit of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Mr. Eduard Sheverdnadze:
,The Esquipulas II and Tela Agreements are the framework end methodology for resolving the principal political, military and security problems facing the region.
,A prompt solution to the security problems among the Central American States - that is, use of territory and support for irregular groups - will pave the way for an agreement with specific deadlines, for the attainment of a reasonable balance of forces.
,Toward that end, the Government of Nicaragua proposes the drawing up of an agreement between the Central American Governments - setting specific deadlines - for the establishment of a reasonable balance of forces in the region. 
,The United Nations contingent in Central America entrusted with observing the non-use of territory and ensuring that no support is given to irregular groups should not only observe the situation but contribute in a concrete way to accelerating solutions to the specific problems regarding the use of territory and support for irregular groups.
,All countries should back compliance with the deadlines agreed to by the five Central American Presidents in the Tela Agreement.
,The International Support and Verification Commission should immediately establish machinery for administering these funds for the purposes of demobilization and repatriation,,
These agreements must be respected strictly since they embody the will of the five Heads of State of Central America and hold out the concrete possibility that peace may soon shine on Central American soil. In regard to other regional conflicts Nicaragua vigorously supports the principles of independence, self-determination and sovereignty.
We endorse the convening and holding of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation on an equal footing, of all parties including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole  d legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We support the right of the Palestinian people to establish their State on their own soil and we applaud their valiant intifadah.
With respect to Namibia, we support the progress made on the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) through the participation of the United Nations in the supervision of the elections. At the same time, we fully support that resolution, whose full  implementation in its original and definitive form can ensure the cessation of existing irregularities which if allowed to continue would prevent the Namibian people from exercising self-determination and from fully exercising their sovereign rights.
We back the deep aspirations to national unity of the people and Government of Cyprus, and we reaffirm our support for their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We uphold the thesis of direct negotiations between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front for the organization of the referendum on the Western Sahara and the structuring of the decolonization process.
We are concerned that the Iran-Iraq conflict has not yet been finally resolved,. We appeal to both parties to reach a rapid, total and lasting solution, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, in full compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987).
As for Afghanistan, we uphold the right of that people to self-determination, and we consider it vitally important to strengthen the role of the Security Council in the implementation of the Geneva Agreements. We support the reunification of the Korean people. With respect to Lebanon, we express our support for the resolution adopted at the extraordinary Arab summit held in Casablanca last May, as well as for the efforts made by the Tripartite Arab Committee to fulfil the mandate it has received. We unreservedly support the peace forces in Angola and hope for the prompt resolution of the conflict. We likewise support the efforts by the international community to obtain peace for Cambodia.
We also fully support the negotiations between the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (ÐÐÐ¨) and the Government of El Salvador. As the Nicaraguan Government recently stated, we
,recognise the importance that both the fMUi and the Salvadorian Government have attached to the necessary participation of El Salvador's parties and social forces in the current dialogue and negotiations taking place within the framework of the Tela Agreements, signed by the Central American Presidents,, As the Government of Nicaragua has stated publicly, we
,support the right of the Panamanian people to demand compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties on the agreed-upon dates. Nicaragua supports the Panamanian people's right to non-interference in their internal affairs and a peaceful negotiated solution to the conflict,.
Although, historically speaking, law has served as an instrument for legitimating power, it is important to recognize that it has also been much more than that. It has been the mediating factor between the civil society and the political society. If laws arose in order to legitimate reigning political and economic relations, they nevertheless have since become the expression of the consensus of the social community. That is their destiny, their calling.
The same thing has occurred in international law. If it is indeed true that it originated as the expression of a given set of international relations, the changes these relations have undergone must be reflected in the body of international law through its evolution and development, so that it may ever more faithfully guarantee peace and stability in the world.
Now, fortunately, it would seem that the time is approaching when the positions of force that have determined international relations in the past must make way for the policies of disarmament and concerted action. International law together with direct negotiation between parties is becoming m exceptionally important tool for the attainment of peace and harmonious relations between nations.
Just as in the history of national communities the organization of society and the State is based cm the rational foundation of the social pact or contract, in the history of the international community the existence of prevailing norms and traditions also presumes such a pact. However, history has taught us that law, whether national or international, arises as a result of and in response to an initial hegemonic act which generates a given structure of domination in political, economic and social relations. The social contract comes later.
We believe that in the field of international law this is a moment of consensus, of tacit contract, in as much as it is a time in which all - but first and foremost the most powerful States - are searching for means of understanding, for points of equilibrium and stability, for a minimum common ground. From this perspective and in this spirit  Nicaragua  together with 14 other countries  presented to the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Nicosia in September 1988 a draft resolution  which was approved unanimously, calling for the convening in 1989 of a special ministerial conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  with the objective of proclaiming the last decade of this century and the millennium as the Decade for Peace and International law.
The Conference was held in The Hague, where the International Court of Justice is located  from 26 to 29 June of this year. In addition to proclaiming the Decade of International Law  on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, The Hague Declaration calls on the plenary Assembly of the United Nations to adopt it for the entire woe Id community.
More recently, at the Belgrade summit meeting held from 4 to 7 September, the Heads of State of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries ratified the Declaration of The Hague ministerial statement and requested that at the forty-fourth session the United Nations General Assembly proclaim the next decade as the Decade of Peace end International law. In this respect  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will soon be presenting for the consideration of this session of the General Assembly a draft resolution for the proclamation oÂ£ the Decade.
We hope that an era of peace and harmony among nations is approaching. We hope that the irrationality of the system of international economic relations will give way to reason and morality. There will be no peace and development however, until the problem of foreign debt is resolved globally by means of a restructuring of the system which gave rise to the debt in the first place. Bilateral solutions are partial and fictitious because they leave the underlying cause of the crisis Intact.
We know that there will be no peace without development and until there is full observance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. Peace, democracy and development are three complementary, inseparable categories of social existence.
Ecological destruction must be halted. This will involve a re-examination of indiscriminate and unwise industrial production policies. This planet's flora and fauna are dying) pollution is making the air unbreathable in some parts of the world, and a climatic catastrophe seems inevitable.
As for the environmental problem in Central America, the interest of Nicaragua and the other countries of the region in this subject is reflected in the creation of the Central American Commission on Environment and Development, which held its first meeting only days ago.
We feel it appropriate to mention here that the phenomenon of drug trafficking must not be considered exclusively from the perspective of production but mist inevitably be viewed from all angles, taking into account production, distribution, consumption and financial mechanisms.
Drugs became a world-wide problem when they entered the market-place and became the object of financial speculation. Therefore, it should not be overlooked that the drug problem is part of the structural situation affecting relations between poor and highly developed countries, that we have addressed throughout this statement. For the same reason emphasis should be placed on drug consumption and distribution in the highly developed countries, as well as on its production in the poor countries. It should never be forgotten that there will be drugs for sale so long as there is a demand for them. On this subject, Nicaragua has presented for consideration by the Central American Governments a draft agreement containing proposals for machinery and action for the combating of drug trafficking in the Central American region. Similarly, in December 1988 Nicaragua signed the Vienna Treaty on this subject, and in Managua the legislative process is already under way that will lead to its ratification in the shortest possible time.
After I had finished preparing this statement. In which we have omitted any reference to individual or specific responsibilities though they do exist, we unfortunately heard discordant voices from our Central American neighbours. Above all, one among them, claiming to be above good and evil, has pontificated and presented himself as a universal spokesman for democracy and a counsellor and adviser to the entire human race.
Such attitudes do not foster the climate of consensus that seems to prevail today in Central America. Unfortunately those who preach urbi et orbi in this way forget that in their own country and elsewhere in the area there are serious problems of drug trafficking and human rights violations. We hope that our sister nations of the region overcome these grave situations as soon as possible so that democracy, instead of being a myth, can in fact become a reality.
Political co-operation, the easing of tensions and the end of the cold war are steps of exceptional importance for the future of mankind  but they are not enough they are just first steps. Therefore it is necessary to take full advantage of the lucidity that seems to be prevailing at present in order to deal with all problems - political, social, economic and ecological - in a far-reaching way, that would address mankind as Ð° whÐ¾1Ðµ, as a system that co-ordinates and harmonizes those differences which must be seen, nevertheless, as coming from a basic interest and a common platforms the need to live with dignity end in freedom. For that to happen  solidarity and co-operation must become the basis of a new morality in relations between the peoples and among all men. Only then - and here we quote the great Nicaraguan poet, Ruben Dario - can the ,sun of burning gold, shine on the future end destiny of all mankind. 
","If that is so in the case of the painful experience of war, it is equally true of other expressions, culture, art, philosophy, literature - all of which are flourishing today in places that were considered, until new, to be peripheral, and all of which have acquired undeniable universal value. In our judgement, it is imperative that those philosophical arid political premises be understood and accepted in order for there to be hope for an end to the cold war and regional conflicts, and for there to be a possibility of entering a new era of peace  development and co-operation in a world in which inevitable differences of opinion not only coexist but stimulate understanding, solidarity and justice among all the peoples of the Earth. ,The United Nations contingent in Central America entrusted with observing the non-use of territory and ensuring that no support is given to irregular groups should not only observe the situation but contribute in a concrete way to accelerating solutions to the specific problems regarding the use of territory and support for irregular groups. ,The International Support and Verification Commission should immediately establish machinery for administering these funds for the purposes of demobilization and repatriation,,
These agreements must be respected strictly since they embody the will of the five Heads of State of Central America and hold out the concrete possibility that peace may soon shine on Central American soil. As the Nicaraguan Government recently stated, we
,recognise the importance that both the fMUi and the Salvadorian Government have attached to the necessary participation of El Salvador's parties and social forces in the current dialogue and negotiations taking place within the framework of the Tela Agreements, signed by the Central American Presidents,, As the Government of Nicaragua has stated publicly, we
,support the right of the Panamanian people to demand compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties on the agreed-upon dates."
44,1989,BDI,"ï»¿	Â· 
Mr . MBON IMPA (Burundi): As I have the honour of speaking in this important forum of the United Nations, I am happy to convey to the Assembly a message of fraternity and best wishes for every success from Major Pierre Buyoya, Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic of Burundi. 
I am also pleased to express on behalf of the Burundi Government warm and heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President, and the other officers of the Assembly on the confidence shown in you by the Assembly in entrusting to you all the task of guiding our work. We pay a tribute for you, Mr. President, not only as a wise diplomat, experienced in dealing with the many current concerns of the international community, but also as a great defender of solidarity and co-operation between peoples in a spirit of harmony and mutual respect. Through you. Sir, first Nigeria, your country, and then Africa are honoured. I assure you. Sir, that my delegation is determined to give you all the support it can to bring about the success of your noble mandate.
We also join previous speakers in expressing our deep gratitude to Mr.. Daite Caputo, who, as President of the forty-third session guided the Assembly in its many activities with competence and dedication, thus doing honour both to the United Nations and to his country.
We also pay a tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his constant, highly commendable efforts in the service of the international community and for the outstanding successes he has achieved - to his own credit and to that of our Organization - since he assumed his high office. 
Exactly a year ago I reported here on the situation prevailing in Burundi following the events that had occurred in the north of the country in August 1988. I tried then to explain the origin of those events, their causes and the way in which the authorities of the Third Republic had managed the crisis. Today I wish to report solemnly that Burundi has regained its tranquillity and that its sons and daughters are new living in peace, reconciled and trusting one another.
Steps have been taken to organize the return of the refugees who left their motherland. Those steps have been taken in close co-operation with the other member countries of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries - Zaire and Rwanda - and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, At the beginning the return to the fold was slow, because of fear and unhappy memories of what had happened, but it has now become spontaneous and massive. Over 98 per cent of the refugees had returned by the end of May this year, confounding all the forecasts and proving to the whole world that Burundi is always capable of doing its best. It is undoubtedly an example of success very rare in the voluntary repatriation of refugees anywhere in the world.
The repatriates, welcomed as Burundi citizens, have been resettled on the lands they left. As soon as they were resettled they were invited to be involved in our national unity and to live in the understanding and solidarity that have always characterized Burundi society.
The Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic, Major Pierre Buyoya, has called on the refugees and all those who have not yet decided to return to their country, the Burundi citizens who have chosen domicile in the countries that have taken them in, to act as ambassadors of Burundi and not as destroyers, as was the case in the past.
At the physical level, it has not been easy to resettle the repatriates. The Governments has made every effort, resorting to the spontaneous generosity of its citizens, but also to the humanitarian, material and financial and provided by friendly countries and agencies. I take this opportunity to express our thanks to all those who have come to our assistance in the operation to repatriate and resettle the refugees as well as in the socio-economic reconstruction of the stricken region.
We also thank those who continue to support us in our effort to attain oar goal of the total and final reconciliation of the Burundi people. While past regimes were content to evoke the concept of national unity in official statements and sterile debates, the authorities of the Third Republic have matched words with deeds, with the aim of establishing national unity and reconciliation.
National unity is the spearhead of all progress. It is a resource that must be exploited rationally. It has become the corner-stone of the policy of the Administration of the Third Republic, a gamble to be won and a challenge to be met at all costs. We are increasingly proud of our concrete achievements in that direction.
Concrete measures already taken by the authorities of the Third Republic include the formation of a government of national unity the establishment of a National Commission charged with studying the question of national unity} and the massive repatriation of refugees in the good conditions I have already described. The aim of those measures is to achieve the fundamental objectives of national reconciliation, social justice and socio-economic development. Let me dwell on those achievements which undoubtedly will have the greatest effect on the future of the Burundi nation, that is r the work of the National Commission entrusted with studying the question of national unity.
As I had the honour of stating on 10 October 1988 during the General Assembly's forty-third session, that Commission is composed of persons chosen for their wisdom and integrity and representing all social and professional sectors and all ethnic groups of Burundi. Their task was to carry out a thorough analysis of the question of national unity and to make constructive recommendation s based on research into the historical, social and cultural foundations of Burundi unity and its evolution, and the ways in which it had frequently been thwarted.
After thorough and painstaking work, the members of the Commission submitted a report to the President of the Republic. It has been distributed both within Burundi and abroad.
For its analysis, the Commission studied the historical and cultural foundations of national unity. It also gave careful consideration to the present situation in respect of the unity of Burundi. The report stressed that divisionists continued to use fallacious reasoning, such as ethnic, regional or clan origins. It revealed that more than 90 per cent of the people of Burundi are peasants who want to live in peace and that therefore the overwhelming majority of the population is not involved in the conflict.
The Commission suggested to the Government a series of clear recommendations to guide the people of Burundi in building the country. These recommendations pinpoint actions and a line of conduct for all partners in the Burundi nation and involve our citizens as well as the public administration. The Commission believes that it is necessary above all to condemn and combat all forms of exclusion as well as all phenomena that would back that type of ideology. These phenomena are mainly violence, globalization, extermination, a confusion between the political majority and the ethnic majority, and discriminatory practices.
Another recommendation concerns the ethic of national unity. It should be based on respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, the sense of the common good, truth and a love of work. The ethic of national unity should take concrete form in the equality of citizens' rights and duties.
The National Commission entrusted with the question of national unity recommended for adoption the establishment by Burundi of a charter of national unity, to be ready in December 1989, a pact to be ratified by the whole population of Burundi, a proclamation of faith and a solemn commitment to justice, peace and democracy.
The charter of national unity will define the duties and responsibilities of each citizen regarding unity, the rights of citizens, and, in particular, the security and equality of all. The charter of unity will therefore be a code of conduct and a guideline for living.
The other recommendations involve the essential areas of national life, and concern in particular the management of public affairs, education, the training of youth, economic development and information. More specifically, at the political level we shall work for the democratization of institutions, giving priority to the strengthening of a sound political climate. In fact, it is essential that the population be guaranteed an atmosphere of confidence and security, without which no policy of democratization can succeed.
The democratization of national political life must be accompanied by the democratic functioning of institutions. This process should provide the country with a Constitution that takes into account Burundi realities and provides for specific machinery to regulate the democratic functioning of the institutions. 
When he officially received the report of the National Commission entrusted to study the question of national unity, the President of the Republic pledged to follow its recommendations. The Head of State immediately announced practical provisions to be taken by the Government in order to ensure transparency and fairness in the essential areas of life, such as education, employment, security, democratic institutions and the question of refugees.
I am pleased to inform the Assembly that most of those provisions have already been implemented and are being carried out successfully.
As regards education, appropriate regulations have been drawn up and adopted to guarantee transparency and fairness at all levels of instruction. In the field of employment, access of workers to higher posts in all sectors will be based solely on competence.
In pursuance of this endeavour of national reconciliation, on 24 July 1989, the President of the Republic published the results of various provincial colloquia on national unity. The guiding principle of these colloquia, which brought together a large number of our citizens from all social and professional sectors, was that the report of the National Commission on national unity should not be considered as a conclusion but rather as a starting-point for deep reflection by all the citizens of Burundi on the question of national unity.
The recommendations made by these colloquia will make it possible to complete the constructive analyses and proposals of the Commission, particularly by drawing up the charter of national unity, which must emerge from the whole Burundi people as a shared vision of a future of unity.
Since the establishment of the Third Republic fundamental choices have been made to ensure that institutions are as democratic as possible, even though at one point these developments were curbed by the events of August 1988. Since democracy means participation by all citizens in managing the affairs of the country, all the people of Burundi are participating in the life of the country through dialogue and harmonization, which have become a real mode of government in our country.
The Party of Unity for National Progress - which had long been the crucible of national unity - has been restructured in order to serve as the ideal framework for the exercise of this democracy in Burundi. Elections by universal suffrage and secret balloting have already been successfully organised with the aim of establishing the basic organs of the Party. This democratic process will continue up to the highest levels of the Party and the Administration.
This process should lead to the establishment of social justice - another concern of the Government of the Third Republic.
There is a constant struggle to establish social justice. Measures are taken every day in the health, employment and education sectors so that all citizens of Burundi can participate in the construction of their country, to make it a State of law and peace. Only on that condition will our country be able to focus on its social and economic development.
In regard to the latter, the Third Republic has given priority to the development of the rural areas, where 90 per cent of the people of Burundi live. In this context, the fifth five-year plan for social and economic development gives priority to the sectors of agriculture and rural development, and concerted and sustained efforts are being made to develop the social infrastructure, such as schools, health centres and supplies of drinking water. Furthermore  economic management has been improved through a relentless struggle declared by the President of the Republic against corruption  misappropriation of public funds fraud and other misuse of funds. The establishment of a Board of Auditors is part of the same concern.
In spite of the priority given to the search for solutions for the internal problems of our country  Burundi is also closely following developments in the international economic and political climate  threatened as it is by hazards of all kinds.
Convinced that peace and security are the prerequisites for lasting development, the authorities of Burundi have made them the central objectives of their foreign policy. Tb this end, we focus our efforts on maintaining a calm atmosphere with all of our neighbours, near or far.
At the international level, we are indeed pleased at the progress achieved in respect of peace and disarmament. The international communityâs particularly encouraged by the detente which now characterizes international relations. The improvement in Soviet-American relations gives the entire world hope for international stability, since it is seen as a possibility for lasting peace and fruitful co-operation.
We also note with great satisfaction the fact that statesmen from all continents are increasingly demonstrating their will and their readiness to do ALL in their power to search for just, peaceful and lasting solutions to armed conflicts or potential conflicts everywhere in the world. This leads one to hope that peace will become a continuing concern throughout the world.
In the field of disarmament, Burundi is of the opinion that the narrowing in the American and Soviet positions is creating favourable conditions for the completion of negotiations under way in the bilateral framework, at the Conference on Disarmament  or within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. We are also confident that 1er.g disappointed hopes that some military expenditures could be released for development activities may at last become a reality. We are pleased at the encouraging and reassuring words expressed from this very rostrum by Mr. George Bush, President of the United States of America, and by Mr. Shevardnadze, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet âion, concerning the progressive elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons, and the redaction of conventional weapons.
The international community is now paying particular attention to the evolution of regional conflicts. The peace process in Angola see rte today to be at an impasse, after the announcement of UNITA of the suspension of talks following the Gbadolite agreement. We know that that agreement, in which 20 African Heads of State, including my own, were involved, is the result of patient and courageous work. I should like to pay well deserved tribute to President Mobutu of Zaire, for his mediation efforts for peace. I also hope that his recent meeting in Washington with the United States President George Bush will impart new momentum to the peace process begun in Angola. We also urge the parties to the conflict rapidly to resume their negotiations and to comply with the commitments that emerged from the CÃ¬badolite agreement.
In South Africa, the Government of the country of apartheid unceasingly proclaims its intention of beginning a new era in that country  but to this day so-called reforms do not have much credibility and remain insignificant because they are not aimed at the foundations of that Ignoble system.
The International community must therefore remain vigilant, because those so-called reforms may very well be aimed only at diverting public opinion, we can lend credibility to statements made by the South African authorities only If those authorities resolutely decide to raise the state of emergency now in force, to free all political prisoners including Nelson Mandela and for put an end to the reign of terror against anti-apartheid filters.
As regards the question of Namibia the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - the very basis of the independence process of Namibia - is under way with some difficulty. None the less, the organization of free elections planned for November this year constitutes for the international community a glimmer of hope that Namibia will be independent in 1990 and that we shall be able to welcome it into the community of sovereign nations at the next session of the general Assembly.
By the thousands of Namibians who have returned to their motherland we extend fraternal greetings and our wishes for a better life in a free and prosperous Namibia.
Still on our own continent, acceptance by the parties to the conflict in Western Sahara of the peace plan of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) is an important step in the settlement of the Sahraoui question. That approach will allow the development of the Sahraoui people. Which will thus be able freely to decide on its future. Burundi urges Morocco and the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to persevere in their efforts at dialogue and at the peaceful settlement of the conflict.
Likewise, the recent conflict between two neighbouring fraternal countries, Senegal and Mauritania, has been given great attention by the authorities of my country. We earnestly hope that the peace efforts made by the President of Mali on behalf of the OAO, and the efforts resumed in May by the President of Egypt, current Chairman of our continental Organization, will soon be successful. We also recognize the peace efforts that President Mubarak is making in southern Africa end in particular in Namibia. That great statesman has had an impact beyond the borders of our continent,  d this augurs well for the success of his initiatives. In the Middle East, we support and encourage the initiatives to restore peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and in particular the 10-point peace plan proposed by President Mubarak. That plan - which kindled hope - has been seriously considered by the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð Ð¨), but we regret that it has just been rejected by the other party to the conflict, Israel. Burundi, which saw in that plain a glimmer of hope for the solution to the problem of Palestine, still hopes that the rejection is only temporary and that Palestinians and Israelis will SOOT  meet at the negotiating table to discuss their long-awaited peace.
Elsewhere in the world, the situation in Lebanon has become explosive once again. It is our most ardent wish that the various factions will reach an understanding that will preserve human lives and spare suffering in Lebanon. Our country supports and encourages the mediation efforts of the Arab Tripartite Committee.
The International Conference on Cambodia, which has just been held in Paris last August, was aimed at finding a political solution to a crisis that dates back almost 20 years. The global settlement plan for the Cambodian question, which has not yet been accepted by all the parties involved in the conflict, should make it possible to speed the restoration of peace in Cambodia and the subregion. Burundi supports these direct talks and urges the parties to the conflict to choose to strengthen the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation instead of to continue armed fratricidal confrontation.
Concerning the question of Korea, my country supports the principle of peaceful reunification. In this framework we urge the leaders of the two fraternal countries to continue their dialogue so that the peace process can soon come to a successful conclusion. Regarding 'the Iran-Iraq conflict, the peace process, already reflected in a cease-fire, should be strengthened by the implementation of the other elements of the peace plan recommended by the United Nations and accepted by the two parties.
In Cyprus, the dialogue begun by the two communities, and the process of reconciliation, should continue, for the preservation of the Cypriot nation and in the higher interests of its people.
We are sincerely pleased at the atmosphere of understanding and harmony that is developing in Central America. In this context, we are pleased at the conclusion of the Tela accords, and we are glad to welcome the prospects for normalization of relations between the countries in the region.
The delegation of Burundi wishes to express its great pleasure at the ever-widening role played by the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts, and to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for his zeal, dedication and effectiveness in the accomplishment of that noble mission.
Together with this somewhat troubled political situation - which does have some encouraging prospects - the developing countries are confronted increasingly by grave economic and environmental constraints. The debt problem, the worsening economic situation and climatic disturbances ate all concerns that increasingly affect the neediest sectors of our populations.
In the framework of their efforts to confront the debt problem and the related economic difficulties, many developing countries are implementing economic adjustment programmes. In this respect, the failure of negotiations on the renewal of the International Coffee Agreement has placed the producer countries - especially the smallest among them, including my own - in an extremely delicate situation. In fact, these countries, most of which had just undertaken structural adjustment programmes in their economies - programmes that had begun to generate results will see their hopes crumble if the countries responsible for the failure of negotiations do not review their position. We therefore appeal to the latter to adopt a responsible and united attitude towards the producer countries that are so seriously stricken.
Recently a number of countries announced measures to alleviate or write off the debt of the developing countries. We want to take this opportunity to extend our most sincere thanks for these gestures, which reassure us and encourage us to persevere in our programmes for economic recovery. However, these efforts of the developed countries should be accompanied by consideration of measures that would involve the net transfer of resources to the developing countries, as well as the prices of commodities. The strategy of a case-by-case debt resolution, supported by the seven most industrialized countries, seems to us insufficient as a solution to the debt problem. Therefore my country supports firmly the proposal to convene an international conference on debt. We believe that the holding of such a conference could lead to a global approach to the thorny question of indebtedness.
Since the problem of the environment began to be studied the international community has become aware of the danger involved in the pollution of the atmosphere, deforestation, desertification and other scourges by which nature is damaged. It has also undertaken intensive activity to mobilize State and specialized agencies involved in these fields in order that appropriate international regulations may be established. Burundi is confident that, thanks to this understanding and cooperation by all, the world will be spaced this danger. We cannot gloss over criminal actions of certain industrialized societies in the northern hemisphere that are with impunity transferring toxic wastes to third-world regions. The dangers that this poses to human, animal and vegetable life, present and future, has been denounced many times by the International community. The drug problem constitutes another grave threat to the survival of mankind. We encourage the American and other States that have decided resolutely to combat this scourge, and we urge other nations to follow their example.
Today, on the eve of the next century, conditions seems conducive for achieving milestones towards building a world in which peace, justice and security will prevail. Within States dialogue and reconciliation are winning out over confrontation, and in inter-State relations respect for international law is increasing. Considerable progress has been achieved in disarmament. That is why the Burundi delegation urges all Members of the United Nations to do all in their power to safeguard these important achievements and to strengthen this movement for peace and solidarity among nations and peoples.
","The National Commission entrusted with the question of national unity recommended for adoption the establishment by Burundi of a charter of national unity, to be ready in December 1989, a pact to be ratified by the whole population of Burundi, a proclamation of faith and a solemn commitment to justice, peace and democracy. The guiding principle of these colloquia, which brought together a large number of our citizens from all social and professional sectors, was that the report of the National Commission on national unity should not be considered as a conclusion but rather as a starting-point for deep reflection by all the citizens of Burundi on the question of national unity.

44,1989,CUB,"ï»¿May I first, on behalf of the people and Government of the Republic of Cuba and on my own behalf, express our warmest congratulations to Major General Joseph N. Garba, outstanding son of the brotherly people of Nigeria, on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. At the outset, too, we wish to express our appreciation of Mr. Dante Caputo, a remarkable Latin American political figure and statesman, who performed brilliantly as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. During that session we welcomed with satisfaction and hope the disarmament agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States, which undoubtedly opened the way for a relaxation of tension, a reversal of the arms race and the removal of the threat of war. We cannot overlook the influence of the Soviet union's policy of peace on that.
Hope of peace is still uncertain, for those are just initial steps, yet to be consolidated. The nuclear arsenal remains virtually intact. The United States and some of its allies plan to modernize theirs, and have declared that the strategy of North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be maintained. The United States military budget is not being reduced. Therefore, we should not deceive ourselves or harbour illusions that tensions have disappeared from the international arena. A difficult road lies ahead. Yet, there are some grounds for hope, unless the Government of the United States itself to be lured by the dangerous and cherished idea that socialism can be brought down from within, and adopts a policy of arrogance and domination.
Cuba strongly supports a policy of peace, and will do everything it can contribute to making this process, which is all-important for mankind, irreversible. However. the fundamental idea prevailing in the United States position is that peace among the big Powers, detente between the blocs, should allow the United States to pursue its policy of pressure and threat against revolutionary, Progressive and independent countries of the third world.
Therefore peace should not be seen exclusively in the context of the level of confrontation between the big Powers. The peace that we non-aligned developing countries - which do not possess nuclear weapons but which have the great strength of our moral weapons - seek, the global. honourable, just and lasting peace we are a11 looking forward to, requires that underdeveloped nations also benefit from the climate of detente. As the first Vice-President of the Council of state and of the Council of Ministers of  Ministers, General of the Army Raul Castro stated at the  Ninth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries: 'The security and peace of the rich are not the security and peace for which the poor nations struggle. We want peace with sovereignty, independence, dignity, Justice and development. We want a truly universal Peace without interference or aggression.' 
We cannot conceive, much less accept, that while talks and negotiations agreements that contribute to disarmament, international peace and security, the United states continues at the same time to apply its hostile policies and actions against independent nations in different parts of the world. The situation prevailing in Panama today is the clearest example of the arrogance with which the empire views peace with small states  - undoubtedly a peace  with sharp claws.  Cuba has been instantly reaffirming, the continued provocations and campaigns orchestrated, day and night against Panama, more than against an individual or an event, are designed to create an atmosphere conducive to a United States breach of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty under which Panama will gain full sovereignty over the Canal and which requires the dismantling of United States military bases in the Canal Zone by the end of this century.
The Ninth Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries expressed its concern over the increase of United States troops in Panama and at continued military manoeuvres on Panamanian territory, which create a situation of tension that could lead to serious conflict. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed in Belgrade their solidarity with the people of Panama in their struggle to consolidate the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country. They demanded full observance of the letter and spirit of the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977 and rejected any action that might constitute a violation or disregard the validity of the treaties and called upon the United States to refrain from adopting any measure or action that could prevent their full implementation. They deplored the coercive economic measures imposed against the Republic of Panama and demanded their immediate termination. 
The international community's solidarity with the heroic people of Panama is necessary to prevent the threat that now looms over that country from becoming a reality. There is another situation of tension in our region that has not yet been resolved. The Central American conflicts, which has lasted for years, has seen an important development in the Tela Agreements, crowning efforts that reflect the political will of Latin American peoples and Governments. We hope that such serious negotiating efforts will counter the United States Government's policy of interference which - after years of sustained heavy financial backing of the Somoza bands operating against Nicaragua whose disbanding has now been legally decided - is now promoting and appropriating funds for the Nicaraguan opposition with a view to sabotaging the country's legitimate win and producing an electoral victory favourable to its own interests.
We welcome the calm and firm attitude of the Sandinista Government in the search for a just and honourable solution to a conflict that has taken the lives of many of Nicaragua's best youth, fallen in defence of their national sovereignty and independence. The search for a politically negotiated solution in El Salvador is also part of the negotiating process in Central America. Acceptance of the Tela Agreements by both parties to the conflict allows us to harbour hopes for the honourable solution sought by a people which have suffered the horrors of a terrible repression that has taken thousands of lives and inspired Salvadorean patriots to Put up a formidable fight, we support the just stand of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLM) and the Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR), which have once again shown their readiness to hold negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue.
We express our solidarity with the just demand of the people and Government of Argentina to recover their sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. we also support Bolivia's call for a direct and useful outlet to the sea.
The Iran-Iraq conflict, which has for years kept these two non-aligned countries immersed in a bloody war that should never have begun, is now moving towards negotiation. Hostilities have ceased, but certain elements contained in security Council resolution 596 (1987) have yet to be Implemented before the achievement of a just and stable peace is possible. The imperialist presence in the Gulf, .here naval forces pose a threat to the security and independence of States in the region, does not contribute to attaining the much needed permanent peace. In South West Asia the signing of the Geneva Agreements has not prevented one of the parties, with the support and assistance of the United States Government, from continuing its attempts to impose a military solution contrary to the letter and spirit of the Geneva Agreements. Cuba supports the national reconciliation policy being pursued by the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan in a flexible and persistent fashion. The completion of Vietnamese troop withdrawals from Cambodia constitutes an important contribution to the political solution of the Cambodian conflict. Regrettably, however, the recent meeting in Paris did not bring about immediate results.
The situation in the Middle East is worsening and it has not yet been possible to get all the parties involved to agree to convening and holding an international Peace conference, which is in our view a viable way to resolve the conflict, with the participation of all parties concerned on an equal footing, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (H.0). the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Our Government expresses its unrestricted support for their right to independence and a national State. The intifidah. the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people against the ruthlessness of Zionism, deserves the respect and recognition of the entire international community. Cuba reiterates its condemnation of the actions of Israel and the united States, its strategic ally, and expresses the conviction that the solution to the conflict in the Middle East must necessarily entail a solution to the question of Palestine.
We support the just cause of the Lebanese people in their struggle for national unity and territory integrity. We reiterate our support for the legitimate rights of the Cypriot people to preserve their national unity, independence, sovereignty and non-aligned character. We consider the convening of an international conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations to be a positive initiative.
we wish to express our support for the just policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at' the peaceful reunification of their country and the total withdrawal of United States occupation troops from the south of the peninsula. We are confident that we will soon be able to welcome a delegation from a unified Korea to the United Nations.
We support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Sahraoui State and the withdrawal of the Moroccan administration and troops from the territory of Western Sahara.
We reiterate our support for Madagascar's recovery of its rights over the Malvinas Islands - Glorieuses, Juan de Neva, Europa and Bassas da India - as well as for the aspirations of the Comoros Islands to recover their sovereignty over Mayotte. Progress in the situation in southern Africa has been significant since December last, when the United Nations became the stage for the signing of the Tripartite Agreements that preceded the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). There is no doubt that the long and complex negotiating process which resulted in the signing of the Tripartite Accords is proof that serious negotiations can be held while the legitimate interests of all parties are respected. As our President, Comrade Fidel Castro, has pointed out, Cuba negotiated seriously and is seriously fulfilling its commitments. By 22 September 1989, a total of 20,666 combatants had returned victorious to our homeland, in compliance with the agreed timetable, which was duly monitored by the united Nations verification team.
In conformity with the decision of the Ninth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries held recently in Belgrade, the united Nations has the lofty and delicate responsibility of monitoring the implementation of the provisions of resolution 435 (1978) and of ensuring that the Namibian people and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), its legitimate representative, can express themselves, without obstacles of any type, in the free and sovereign elections scheduled for next November. Cuba joins the non-aligned countries and all
honourable peoples the world over in demanding an immediate end to all interference in Namibia by forces of the colonial Power.
At their Ninth Summit Conference the non-aligned countries raised their voice to denounce the intransigence of the apartheid racist regime, as manifest in its continued internal repression. The Conference pointed out that apartheid cannot be reformed, that it must be eliminated through the complete eradication of its criminal system. The Conference also called on the United Nations to adopt effective measures in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Cuba fully endorses these Just demands of the Non-Aliped Movement.
All necessary measures must be taken to avoid fraud in the forthcoming elections. Threats and acts of aggression against the Namibian people must come to end. The Koevoet racist military forces, which are part of the Namibian police, must be disbanded immediately, voters should cast their votes in the places .here they are registered. Secret ballots must be respected. Illiterate voters should  be able to have the assistance of persons of their choice,  and ballots should be counted in the districts, and not brought to the capital.
The Assembly should have full powers and not be subordinated to the administrator. as the. representative of the South African racist regime wishes, when deciding on the state to be taken towards independence.
We note with satisfaction that the climate of aggression and threats from outside against Ethiopia is beginning to be disposed. As a result, the circumstances which, more than 10 years ago - when a request was made by the Ethiopian Government - made the presence of Cuban internationalist contents necessary to assist Ethiopia's forces in repelling outside aggression, have come to an end. Thus the Cuban combatants who comprised small contingent in Ethiopia returned home this September. In this manner Cuba has once again proven its ability to express its solidarity with other peoples and at the. same time contribute to international peace.
With the independence of Namibia and its entry into the international arena and the community of nations, the struggle against colonialism will have achieved a great victory. However, we should not feel satisfied, more than 20 territories, with a potation of several million, still live under colonial domination. The people of Puerto Rico remain under a foreign boot, after almost 100 years of United States military occupation. It is well known that the so-called Plebiscite with which the United States Administration intends to determine the Territory's future is an attempt to incorporate Puerto Rico, as a new state, in the Union.
Because of this, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization this year not only reaffirmed the right of the Boricuan people to self-determination and independence, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), but also expressed its hope, and that of the 'international community, that, in any consultation, the people of Puerto Rico would be able to exercise, without any hindrance, its right to self-determination and independence, with expressed recognition of their sovereignty and full political equality, in line with the provisions of resolution 1514 (XV). Cuba, together with the other non-aligned countries, considers that efforts must be made to put an end to all existing colonial situations by the turn of the century.
The problems deriving from the sustained growth of the drug consumer market - particularly in the United States - and the resulting incentive to production and trafficking have become increasingly serious. We must face this situation resolutely. The struggle against drug production and trafficking must go side by side with the struggle against consumption, against the market which, in the United States alone, produces annual profits exceeding $150 billion. Cuba is, as always, prepared to play its corresponding role in that battle.
One issue that deserves our immediate attention is the threat to global security resulting from the international economic situation. We reiterate that, while the steps being taken in the field of disarmament and towards the creation of a climate of detente in the solution of some conflicts, as well as in the relations between the great Powers, are encouraging, such progress has not led to solutions to the problems of underdevelopment or the economic crisis afflicting the third world. He will not advance towards a real system of security so long as the already huge gap between the developed countries and the underdeveloped part of the world - which is suffering from an increasingly critical situation of backwardness, poverty and underdevelopment - continues to grow. These issues must be reconsidered, and a lasting solution found, if we wish to live in a world of true peace and social stability.
The encouraging picture painted by the economic performance of the industrialised nations during 1988 is very different indeed from the situation of crisis prevailing in the economies of the developing countries. United Nations studies themselves indicate that the average per capita income of industrialized countries is 50 times higher than that of the least developed countries, and that the mere annual growth of the wealthiest countries amounts almost to the total annual per capita income of the poorest nations, which is approximately 3300.
What kind of peace can we talk about in such a situation of seemingly unsolvable imbalances, where the poor increase the opulence of the wealthy? If peace is not linked to development, then poverty, inequality and violence will not disappear.
The phenomena which continue to characterize international economic relations, perpetuating this unjust situation, which are particularly evident in third-world nations with respect to unpayable external debt, are well known: protectionism? difficult access to markets for the main products of the developing countries; deterioration in the terms of trade? dumping; reduced financial flews? high interest rates? coercive economic measures? international monetary and financial instability? and external debt. All of this has resulted, in the recent past, in a net transfer of resources from the developing countries to the industrialized nations, causing not only continued plundering that prevents growth and development but also a new form of economic colonialism. Suffice it to mention, as an example, that the transfer of resources from Latin American countries to their creditors, in recent years alone, amounts to $179 billion. This represents 4 par cent of their annual gross domestic product - a figure that exceeds, by far, Germany's forced external net transfer of resources after its defeat in the First World War.
Many have focused their attention on the specific problem of external debt. But consistent steps towards true solutions have not yet been taken. Proposed solutions, coming mostly from creditors and based on case-by-case rescheduling, have only worsened the economic situation of debtor countries, although they have succeeded in their main objective of keeping creditor banks from enduring imminent heavy losses. Debtor countries, however, are growing nearer to insolvency, and their stagnation is prolonged with economic and social costs that have led to serious political disturbances and claimed hundreds and hundreds of human lives.
Proposals made within and outside the United Nations, based on a reduction of the amount of the debt, involve recognition that the debt is unpayable. The experience of all these years only confirms that the real solution to the debt problem involves the total elimination of the debt and the establishment of a new international economic order which would do away with the causes of today's grim Picture. Existing proposals would be a palliative only if reductions reached substantial levels, which Latin American Economic System experts have fixed at no less than 50 per cent, if ceilings are set for interest rates, and if a general
framework for implementation were established including all debtors without exception.
As long as we attempt to resolve the problem on a case-by-case basis we shall continue to fail. We would support United Nations efforts to bring about a real political dialogue between debtor and creditor countries.
The special session of the General Assembly to be held in the spring of 1990 and its preparatory process will give us an opportunity to reassess the challenges posed by this ongoing crisis of development in the face of the world's new economic and social realities. We hope the special session will promote frank and constructive dialogue with the understanding that unless swift and realistic solutions are promoted the problems new affecting vast regions of the world will in the future threaten the countries of the North with social and political instability.
Of course, the international development strategy for the 1990s will have to be realistic and provide for concrete policy measures with defined goals and objectives. But in particular it will require the readiness of industrialized countries to contribute to efforts by developing countries.
Protection of the environment is a concept that must be clearly defined because of its close relation to problems of development, the protection of natural resources, international economic relations, extreme poverty and the sovereignty of States, it is a matter of concern to all nations, a matter with respect to which imperialist actions bear a great responsibility, owing to the transfer to our countries of polluting industries by capitalist developed countries irrespective of the diversity of forms the problem takes in different areas. The problem must therefore be examined and measures chosen with the participation of all States, not a restricted or select group. Iâ particular, its close links to problems of development must be very clear, since underdevelopment is the main threat to the third world. Underdevelopment stems from our colonial past, which also involved, among other acts of aggression, the devastation of our forests and caused irreparable damage to our environment. Increasingly, the United Nations is becoming the optimal forum for contributing to the solution of the numerous problems we are facing. Maximum co-operation by all Member States is necessary to make its action more effective. The unique role played by the Secretary-General through his efforts to eradicate hotbeds of conflict has gained recognition by the international community, thus strengthening the Organization's potential to mediate and give political negotiating coverage to parties that had in the past been engaged on the battlefield. He should pursue those endeavours wherever conditions allow in the search for compromise and the honourable peace demanded by our peoples.
The growing role of the third world in the United Nations may be seen in the context of that positive performance. There is no doubt that the United Nations represents the development of our planet since the end of the Second World War - from the establishment of the Organization to the present day. Today's United Nations is not and cannot be the United Nations of 1945. We must therefore embark on a sustained process of democratising its machinery in keeping with the interests of all member States. Cuba has already stated its position on this subject, which is of interest to the entire international community.
The Bush Administration has clearly begin to take steps with respect to Cuba that would make it the eighth United States Administration not wishing to establish a climate of peace and good-neighbourliness and persisting in hostile and aggressive action against us.
Cuba knows it is not alone in the struggle to defend its rights, its independence and its sovereignty. We appreciate the numerous expressions of solidarity we have received. We wish in particular to refer to the decision adopted by Heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries at the recent ninth summit conference held in Belgrade. They condemned the continued threats of aggression against Cuba, the violation of its air-space and territorial waters and the blockade imposed against Cuba in the areas of finance, credit and trade, along with radio broadcasts from the United States and the decision to begin television broadcasts of a destabilizing nature, in violation of international law and, particularly, the 1982 Nairobi Convention.
We have warned the United States of the consequences of beginning such broadcasts, it will bear full responsibility. Cuba will not tolerate such session in silence. We shall respond - and I wish expressly to reaffirm that from this rostrum. Heads of state or Government of the Bon-Aligned Movement also reiterated their support and solidarity with respect to Cuba's Just demand for the return of the territory illegally occupied by the United states at its Guantanamo naval base. Cuba will never forget those decisions, which should be taken into account by the united states Administration as it formulates its regional policies.
The anti-Cuban attitude of United States arch-reactionary circles on the Potomac increases the political blindness of the top leadership of that country in its vain attempt to make the Cuban revolution yield, this has reached the point -here strategic aircraft in combat formation have been sent to our country simulating a massive air strike, as took place on 20 May last, while United states submarines approached our shores with unknown objectives, which, could have caused serious and delicate incidents. Like all other peace-loving nations that are firmly confuted to achieving the social and economic development demanded by their peoples, Cuba shares the great wish to devote all its resources to the noble goal of develop.
Cuba - the Cuban revolution - has been a reality for more than three decades, and it constantly renews its energies and strengths. Long ago. our people decided to sever the chains of bondage to metropolis countries and neo-colonialism, and freely chose the economic, political and social system It wanted. Therefore, our readiness to maintain peaceful relations of co-operation and friendship with any country - and the United States ought to remember this - is based primarily on this principle; Cuba must be treated for what it is, an independent state and a sovereign socialist nation.
","We hope that such serious negotiating efforts will counter the United States Government's policy of interference which - after years of sustained heavy financial backing of the Somoza bands operating against Nicaragua whose disbanding has now been legally decided - is now promoting and appropriating funds for the Nicaraguan opposition with a view to sabotaging the country's legitimate win and producing an electoral victory favourable to its own interests.

44,1989,IRN,"ï»¿
Let me at the outset offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Joseph Garba on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. I hope that under his leadership the Assembly will be able to achieve desirable results. To that end, he can rely on the co-operation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
My thanks go also to Mr. Dante Caputo for his able work during the forty-third session, as well as to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts at the United Nations and on the international and regional scene.
The demise of Imam Khomeini, the leader of the Islamic world and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran - may God be pleased with him - was a tragic loss for the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Islamic world and all freedom-loving people. During many years of relentless struggle, he spared no effort to oppose exploitation, tyranny and injustice. Our people have entered the second decade of their revolution with precious experience gained from 10 years of resistance against aggression, political propaganda and economic pressure, and are now making great strides towards national reconstruction with resolute determination and reliance on the fundamental principles of the Islamic revolution.
As we approach the 1990s, the world is moving towards relaxation of tension both at the global and the regional levels. The international community's efforts to resolve regional conflicts are indeed commendable, but we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that there remain many unresolved disputes with the potential to threaten international peace and security. The principal cause of the perpetuation of these crises is the domineering policies pursued by the big Powers against the interests of third-world nations. In order to set this situation right, we must therefore alter unjust international relations and give them a basis of justice and respect for international law.
The Non-Aligned Movement has called for the designation of the 1990s as the decade of international law. During that decade Governments and international forums should redouble their efforts to strengthen respect for the rule of law in international relations. History has shown that it is those with power and might who are more prone to violate principles of international law. Unlawful actions by the United States against my country - such as the seizure of out assets, attacks on our oil platforms and the downing of our civilian aircraft - are clear examples of disrespect for legal norms by those who possess power and might. It is our hope that in the next decade, with the efforts of the United Nations and a reassessment by the bio Powers of their behaviour and conduct on the international scene, the ground will he laid for the rule of law.
Political and economic domination have been addressed at length in international forums, but what has not received adequate attention is cultural domination. The world-domineering Powers use cultural domination - a prelude to other forms of domination - to gain political influence and to alienate the nations of the third world from their social and cultural values. Unfortunately, nations that desire to return to their own cultural identity are subjected to severe attacks by the domineering Powers. Decisions by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement aimed at countering cultural domination by arrogant Powers in the Islamic world and the third world have ushered in a movement to eliminate that form of domination. Cultural attacks by some Western countries have been carried out as a result of an incorrect assessment of the realities and an underestimate of the strong feelings and beliefs of Muslim nations. During the presidency of France, the European Community can gain its rightful place in its relations with Muslim nations, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, by correcting its past political mistakes and by respecting the principles and social and religious values of Islamic societies. At this point I must address one of the destructive, devastating social tragedies of our time, namely, trafficking in and the production and use of drugs. The international community has rightly devoted special attention and displayed special sensitivity with respect to this problem. Iran is located geographically in a region that provides a link for a major part of the illicit drug trafficking from east to west. That has put a special burden of responsibility on the shoulders of the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran with respect not only to the apprehension of international drug traffickers but also to safeguarding the health of our own society. To achieve this aim, we have begun during the past year to close the ways through which illicit drugs are brought into our country, by strengthening co-operation with neighbouring countries and expanding operations to discover and destroy international drug-trafficking networks. Those measures - supplemented by strict laws and heavier punishment for the merchants of death -	have, in a short time, resulted in a considerable reduction in drug trafficking and consumption in Iran. But because of the nature of this phenomenon, an effective campaign against the international mafia of illicit drugs is not possible without international co-operation. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes international efforts to that end.
In the course of the past year, efforts to gain access to quantitatively larger and qualitatively better weapons have continued unabated, while at the same time multilateral negotiations on disarmament with the ultimate purpose of achieving general and complete disarmament under effective international control have continued with undiminished momentum. It appears, however, that the speed at which weapons are amassed is much faster than the pace of efforts in the field of disarmament. Meanwhile, chemical weapons have become comparable, in terms of their
capacity for mass destruction and their brutal nature, to nuclear weapons, and pose a grave threat to regional and international peace and security, arousing serious concern on the part of the international community.
Eight years of global indifference to the use of chemical weapons against the Islamic Republic of Iran has encouraged some countries such as Iraq to build the largest arsenals of chemical and biological weapons and to improve them qualitatively and quantitatively.
The international community's failure to respond properly to Iraq's repeated use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens, during the war and even after the establishment of the cease-fire, as well as ascertainment of their practical advantages have caused world-wide concern over the increasing escalation of such weapons. The Islamic Republic of Iran, as a country that has suffered the most from the recent use of chemical weapons, is convinced that the ultimate remedy lies in the total destruction of all chemical weapons and that such transitory solutions as the prevention of the proliferation of such weapons will not be effective.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded its efforts in the Conference on Disarmament for the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of the production, development, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The principle of universality is an absolute necessity for ensuring the security of States that have been the victims of chemical-weapon use and those that are potentially subject to be threatened by such weapons. The universality of such a convention requires adequate punitive provisions as well as sufficient incentives. Pending the conclusion of the convention all States are bound to abide by the provisions of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons, and delinquent States must be punished immediately after first use.
More than a year has elapsed since the establishment of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. With the utmost regret I must declare that, despite 15 rounds of direct talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General and the with the assistance of his Personal Representative, no step other than the establishment of the cease-fire has been taken for the full implementation of even the first paragraph of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). In paragraph 1 of that resolution, the Security Council demands that
'as a first step towards a negotiated settlement, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq observe an immediate cease-fire ... and withdraw all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries without delay'. That paragraph, which is fully in Line with the most fundamental principles of international law, leaves no room for doubt or for self-serving interpretations, since both the cease-fire and withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries are mandatory measures that need to be taken unconditionally prior to and independent of any negotiations.
On that basis the Secretary-General in his proposed timetable of July and August 1988, envisaged that withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries should take place within 13 days after the cease-fire. The Islamic Republic of Iran agreed in principle with that timetable, which includes timing and procedure for the implementation of all the provisions of resolution 598 (1987). Iraq, however, refused even to consider that timetable and continued to insist on its prerequisite of direct talks prior to the cease-fire. Even after the announcement of the cease-fire and prior to its establishment, the Secretary-General, in his letter of 16 August 1989 to Iran and Iraq, called upon the two countries to begin withdrawal simultaneously with direct talks.
During the past year Iraq has refused to take the very first step in fulfilment of its obligations under the United Nations Charter and the Security Council resolution, namely, withdrawal from the territory of Iran. On the contrary, Iraq has tried to take advantage of its illegal occupation of the territory of Iran to realize the illegitimate and expansionist ambitions for which it launched a war of aggression against its neighbour. On the other hand, Iraq tries to deceive world public opinion by raising the issue of prisoners of war - a Purely humanitarian issue - and utilizing it in its campaign of deception.
A selective approach to the implementation of the provisions of resolution 598 (1987) is not acceptable. According to the letter of the resolution, withdrawal must take place prior to and independent of negotiations. Nevertheless, out of purely humanitarian considerations we have declared that we stand ready to exchange prisoners of war according to the plan proposed by the
Secretary-General. On the basis of the first plan, all prisoners of war should have been released by 20 November 1988, and according to the October plan all of them should have returned to their homes by the end of 1988. The Islamic Republic of Iran has declared its acceptance in principle to both plans; Iraq has failed to accept either plan.
I should also mention at this point that there is an imbalance in the number of prisoners of war registered by the International Committee of the Red Cross in the two countries. Iraq authorities have up until now admitted the capture of about 45,000 Iranian prisoners of war. Of that number, only 19,000 have been registered, while approximately 50,000 prisoners of war have been registered in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which constitutes the majority of Iraqi prisoners of war. That imbalance needs to remedied soon.
We are prepared to continue direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General. It has now become clear that the problem does not lie in the form of the talks or in the lack of confidence between the two countries. The real problem lies in Iraq's refusal to implement the Security Council resolution. As long as there is no serious reaction to this dangerous and illegal stance of Iraq it is highly improbable that we will see progress in the implementation of the resolution, and dwelling on side issues will produce no results. The responsibility is incumbent particularly upon the Security Council, given its commitment in its resolution. However, the world has witnessed with great surprise that the same Security Council that adopted resolution 598 (1987) with much international fanfare has not taken a single step to help with the implementation of that resolution. Rather, it has chosen to watch with total indifference the continued occupation of Iranian territory and the non-implementation of resolution 598 (1987).
Iraq must realize that peace is to the benefit of the two countries and the region. The continuation of the present 'no peace no war' situation can gradually move the region towards a resumption of tension. We are earnest and serious in our determination for peace between the two countries and for stability in the Persian Gulf region. We stand ready to implement resolution 598 (1987) without delay and free from preconditions and excuses. The 1 October plan was proposed after long discussion with the two sides and consultation with the Secretary-General. We accepted that plan despite our comments solely to help the Secretary-General discharge his duties in the implementation of the resolution and because of our confidence in him. Iraq, however, has so far refused to accept the plan. We welcome the visit of Mr. Eliasson, the Secretary-General's Personal Representative, to the two countries. But if those efforts do not lead within a reasonable time to a change in Iraq's stance, other measures must be contemplated.
I now wish to touch upon a number of points regarding peace and security in the sensitive and strategic region of the Persian Gulf. Without doubt the security of that region is closely linked to international peace and security. We believe that durable peace and security should be provided by the States of the region, without foreign interference.
Common religious, cultural and economic grounds among the Persian Gulf countries provide the essential motivation for their greater solidarity as well as the needed strength and power for the maintenance of security in the region without the presence or interference of foreign Powers.
The Islamic Republic of Iran desires to expand bilateral relations with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect for legitimate rights and interests, and endeavours to provide a solid foundation for a durable peace and security without the presence and interference of foreign Powers in the Persian Gulf.
The complete withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan was welcomed by us and by the international community. The Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently insisted on the indisputable right of the people of Afghanistan to self-determination aid to choose their future form of government. While declaring anew our support for the struggle of the Muslim people of Afghanistan, we stress the need for the creation of an Islamic, popular aid non-aligned government that will be free of foreign interference and friendly to all its neighbours, a government which can be realized only with the unity of all segments of the Muslim people of Afghanistan. We shall continue to exert our utmost effort towards that end. We will continue, as we have done in the past, with humanitarian assistance to Afghan refugees in keeping with our Islamic and humanitarian responsibility. We hope, however, that with the final resolution of the Afghanistan problem and an improvement in social and political conditions the road will be paved for the honourable and voluntary repatriation of refugees aid displaced persons.
Last year the oppressed people of Palestine and Lebanon witnessed important and extensive developments. The uprising of the Muslim people of Palestine in the West Bank and on the Gaza Strip, which has lasted for more than 20 months, and other resistance movements of the Palestinians, are a natural consequence of neglecting the inalienable rights of the people of this land. The people of Palestine continue to resist validly and resolutely in the face of the aggressive and criminal practices of the Quds-occupier regime which seeks brutally to suppress the uprising by beating, killing and torturing a large number of revolutionaries. The continuation of this uprising has shown that under no circumstances will the Muslim people of Palestine be ready to accept compromises on their inalienable rights.
If the international community seeks to find a solution to this crisis and to bring about peace and security in the Middle East, it should realize that the only viable remedy lies in the full restoration of the rights of Palestinians, or, in other words, the liberation of the occupied territories the establishment of an independent State in the entire territory of Palestine. Any solution that falls short of meeting the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine cannot guarantee peace and security in this region.
Expansionist acts of aggression by the Zionist regime have widened the scope of the crisis also to Lebanon. The occupation of southern Lebanon, the creation of instability in the region, the suppression of Lebanese and Palestinian resistance groups, the abduction of persons and personalities such as Sheikh Abdul Al-Karim Obeid, and the use of puppets and mercenaries have contributed to further aggravation of the crisis in Lebanon, a country that has already suffered destruction. As if that were not enough, Iraq has also fanned the flames of a destructive civil war in Lebanon by pouring armaments into that country, adding to the number of human losses and subjecting that nation to the peril of partitioning. While emphasizing independence and territorial
Reassuring developments on the world scene and an improvement in the international political climate concerning some of the problems and crises that I have touched upon have thrust the international community into an  era of anxiety  tempered by hope. Weathering this era and easing these anxieties will depend to a large extent on the far-reaching and serious efforts made by international forums and in particular by the United Nations.
1 hope this session will see significant, practical and effective steps taken towards the attainment of those goals.
","The international community's failure to respond properly to Iraq's repeated use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens, during the war and even after the establishment of the cease-fire, as well as ascertainment of their practical advantages have caused world-wide concern over the increasing escalation of such weapons. The Islamic Republic of Iran desires to expand bilateral relations with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect for legitimate rights and interests, and endeavours to provide a solid foundation for a durable peace and security without the presence and interference of foreign Powers in the Persian Gulf. While declaring anew our support for the struggle of the Muslim people of Afghanistan, we stress the need for the creation of an Islamic, popular aid non-aligned government that will be free of foreign interference and friendly to all its neighbours, a government which can be realized only with the unity of all segments of the Muslim people of Afghanistan. We hope, however, that with the final resolution of the Afghanistan problem and an improvement in social and political conditions the road will be paved for the honourable and voluntary repatriation of refugees aid displaced persons. The occupation of southern Lebanon, the creation of instability in the region, the suppression of Lebanese and Palestinian resistance groups, the abduction of persons and personalities such as Sheikh Abdul Al-Karim Obeid, and the use of puppets and mercenaries have contributed to further aggravation of the crisis in Lebanon, a country that has already suffered destruction."
